While out on a run a few days ago, I saw a "FREE" sign and went to check it out. There was a man slowly putting out stuff from his father's house. I grabbed as many totebags as I could run with, and came back later with my car.
- A bunch of nice tote bags from Riverrun, etc
- Riverrun rubber tube posters
- The Best of Roald Dahl (FLL)
- Bitter Blood, a true crime book about a Winston-Salem murder, filled with newspaper clippings with articles about the case and the book
- Filing Cabinet
- Old hand cart with a bunch of old bungee cords
- Old wooden utility cabinet
- Typewriter stand
