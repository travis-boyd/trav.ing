95.90 103.78 SPEAKER_01  door yeah yeah this is what needs to be changed about the gaming industry so
103.78 107.48 SPEAKER_04  it's a relief to see that uh the assets are no longer transparent
107.48 118.52 SPEAKER_03  um this week we are joined by a special guest uh editor-in-chief of second wind nick calandra
118.52 123.12 SPEAKER_05  how are you doing pal i'm doing pretty good i was just nominated for my first uh award for journalism
123.12 143.96 SPEAKER_03  ever yeah oh my god it's amazing congrats i had a lot of a lot of mutuals on there man i i can't play favorites because i am uh also with with rebecca valentine and and alissa so uh good luck to all three of you and i've done i can't remember who the other uh other person that was in that was but paul tassie but that's right uh good luck to him but a little less because we are not mutuals on twitter
143.96 184.38 SPEAKER_01  that's the hierarchy that's genuinely how it works that's how you know you've made it yeah yeah no just before we get too far i just wanted to i i've just been thinking about this recently like this is also going back before the election but i've been like looking at the like dearth of how many times elon musk was on the campaign trail just talking in front of like trump voters like people in their 50s and 60s and 70s like these old ass people that don't know what a video game is talking like going up in front of them for at least five minutes talking like going like yes i would play the video game and all of a sudden wokeness and it's like what are you doing what are you
184.38 195.66 SPEAKER_04  this is a political rally i don't think i've ever heard you do a uh an elon musk impression before and like you really knocked it out of the park thank you it just came over me it just it hit me
195.66 205.88 SPEAKER_03  i had to do it i know you've wanted to do it in the past so i i'm assuming that took some practice but when you're talking about the top ranked diablo 4 player in the world you have to put some respect
205.88 240.90 SPEAKER_01  on that i know top ranked uh probably if uh wokeness didn't get him probably top path of exile 2 player because of course wokeness as always but i don't know i just love the state of gaming as a whole where like people ring too i saw i love the shield build the shield no healing items in his taskbar maximum intelligence because he's making himself no i just i don't know it's gaming is awesome right now there's people that are normal and play video games because that's what they like doing and then there's people that go in front of uh rallies of 80 year olds complaining about
240.90 257.96 SPEAKER_03  video games which i just think is equally as awesome yeah yeah game gamers is like a as a political constituency is always very fun you don't see that with a lot a lot of like you never see like people like uh i'm a gamer well you know what uh i'm actually a huge tv watcher
257.96 274.22 SPEAKER_01  i'm a filmer i'm a serial binger yeah they they we they need to bring back yellowstone of yellowstone otherwise we're not gonna vote for the democrats yeah joe biden bring back yellowstone did you guys
274.22 293.00 SPEAKER_03  hear that yellowstone i didn't i haven't watched that show but i was supposed to be based and then the show ended up i guess being gay soy and woke because the yellowstone cowboys gave their land to the indigenous people yeah lives one so take that yes spoilers i wasn't done watching no oh well oh fuck
293.00 297.46 SPEAKER_01  now you have to become a reactionary you have to vote for trump now or well i mean it's too late for that
297.46 321.30 SPEAKER_03  next time well to be fair nick uh i've never watched it so i'm sure i botched whatever uh interpretation of that you can you can imagine um let's see uh nick how did you become a capital g gamer tell us about your tell us about your gaming journey sure and was it and and how how many asses
321.30 608.06 SPEAKER_05  did you witness in video games before you became radicalized so many uh it was when i read i saw my own ass that i got radicalized uh yeah no i started gaming at a at a really young age um not not like a dick super into gaming when i was growing up uh my dad was a big computer nerd and so like i had a i had a computer by the time i was like i think he had me installing stuff by like three years old so started to play like a lot of a lot of different computer games and all that like carnivores i just shared a post about that one the other day and realm total war and all that kind of stuff uh i was born in 95 uh so that give you a frame of reference there uh same here 95 yeah so i didn't really get into gaming until more so the ps2 era of like you know retching clank and jack and dexter and all that kind of stuff amazing games love those yeah i was definitely playing a lot of ps1 stuff like spyro and all that but um didn't get fully addicted to into gaming until like call of duty 4 came out uh in the 360 and so by that time like i was very introverted and in school and so i would stay at home play a lot of games with my friends online uh and over time i just kind of i never was never bad at school or anything like that but i was definitely just spending way too much time playing video games so in 2009 uh i was about to become a freshman in high school uh my father uh and my mother like basically said hey you need to find something better to do than just play video games all the time so i was like all right i'll start writing about them and i was not a writer at the time so life hack yeah there was this website called the psx extreme and i was taking part in the comment threads on that and i found these three guys uh that i still work with today even um that just wrote really good comments and i was like hey you guys want to start a gaming website together and they're like sure so we started like this shitty drag and drop website called titan reviews did that for a little bit started up a more official site called uh velocity gamer and then after that started my first like semi-professional website called only sp which covered single player games focused um so i did that from 2012 to 2016 uh and then while i was in college kind of just started burning out on the the game a little bit uh also google like basically killed my site overnight and so uh between college and just kind of having the website kind of fall apart too quickly i ended up selling it to a company called enthusiast gaming uh who was our ad supplier at the time uh and so i i quit doing games media for probably about six months uh and then i saw on game spot daniel dwyer he did this uh video that he was out in like out in poland kind of reporting from the field uh talking about the witcher 3 at the time uh and i got really interested in like from that video alone just like oh that's something i want to do like i've been sitting in my my room or my dorm room or whatever covering games behind the scenes for so many years already like i want to get out and actually see these people meet the studios go see the world kind of thing uh so a few of my former friends and i uh started up a thing called gamumentary uh which was for video game documentaries uh we ran a kickstarter read raised twenty two thousand dollars and then we went and filmed documentaries on darksiders kingdom deliverance uh a bunch of other games including like this this failed game from a studio called outpost games that we're working on sos uh and then after that uh we basically the kickstarter was the only money we had we didn't really make any ad revenue or anything like that from the documentaries because youtube's youtube uh so there was like no plan to move forward so i ended up selling that that brand as well to enthusiast gaming working to secure uh jobs for myself and the guys that made the documentaries with me and as we'll probably talk about later in a certain video that came out that very much skewed that story uh they tried to basically screw up that deal they wanted more uh input into the brand that was not going to exist because there was no money to do anything with it and so uh my story kind of like goes on from there because they they left and then uh omar ahmed who's my lead media producer came in and immediately got hired full-time like i promised they would and then we went to go film the documentary divinity original soon uh and then long story short from there uh game editor-in-chief of the escapist and then ran that for four and a half years and then we got fired and then we started second wind and here we are today where i'm the capital g worst uh games journalist up for the worst
608.06 616.96 SPEAKER_04  games journalist award now you must be so proud you're doing it all by yourself you're not you don't have corporate backing to be the worst games journalist i didn't realize that was the award
616.96 645.94 SPEAKER_03  holy shit that's well incredible tell me tell me about this let's not get out of control here nick yeah i'm proud of you but this is simply the nomination look can we let's talk about if you guys don't know this new game the what they call the real game awards because it's like the anti-woke one of course um it's like just a website it was made by the side scrollers guy stuttering craig cabrudis rambo and who else is involved in that do you know uh i know mr smash jt who needs money

721.98 741.64 SPEAKER_01  i can i ask i don't know if i'm getting ahead of anything or anything like that so what i i should just pull up the the categories let's do yeah no well i before we get to the categories how did this like so i was gonna say caleb you follow the gaming sphere a little bit more than i do why why are you one of the worst games journalists of all time where where did this come from
741.64 748.70 SPEAKER_05  uh yeah so earlier earlier this year uh and obviously your podcast talked about grums quite
748.70 753.62 SPEAKER_03  a bit oh yeah i love that dude so he we've talked about this situation on the show before yeah
753.62 899.62 SPEAKER_05  uh yeah earlier in the year like he was really going after community managers uh pretty much unimpeded like nobody was kind of really fighting back against him or doing anything um and one of the community managers he went for and i'm not going to name her because i just don't want her to get more attention but um he just ruthless like the they were calling her racist for old comments that she had said that she had already admitted like we're wrong and she shouldn't have said and like she apologized for multiple times and you know uh but they were just being absolutely fucking ruthless towards her and nobody nobody was saying anything and grums like i had i had him blocked already because i i he did the take on what was the thing that he did uh it was on a game i forget what game it was now but he had a really stupid take on starfield i think and i had already blocked him for that because i was like this is stupid so i didn't know who he was didn't know why all of a sudden like this dude is so prominent in harassing people and going after people and so when he started going after somebody that that i knew a little bit and like i was like who is this fucking guy like why is he doing this and why are people taking him seriously so i started digging in to grums and i find out like oh he worked on world of warcraft because that's what his profile says he was team lead and i've done close to probably 20 documentaries at this point and i've never heard of the role team lead and i've talked to hundreds of developers probably thousands of developers over my time and i've never heard somebody list themselves as that so i was like what does a team lead do so i start digging into that and i just can't find anything i can't find anything on other websites or even um moby games was like list credits i can't find anything that says here's what a team lead does it's like you have creative directors you have uh lead producers lead programmers whatever team lead was you just like getting coffee for people what team is ostensibly leading from the from basically the sources that i talked to when i was i was really digging into him it's like basically he was a producer it's really what he was like he was essentially helping set schedules for people uh you know going out recruiting people he's almost like a recruiter producer is basically what he was doing but he wasn't coding anything he wasn't doing any art he wasn't making
899.62 925.86 SPEAKER_03  anything probably i wonder maybe we'll talk about this later uh well no we don't want to out anybody but like that's i'm wondering i just probably think we probably talked to some of the same people because we probably did yeah the the people that i spoke with that work with mark were like i mean it was very vague i think that people work a little guarded talking to me because i'm not i don't work for a publication i'm the information pimp or or cecil dirt dirtman or whatever i am
925.86 935.32 SPEAKER_01  just before i just want to say i like that you're like switching your names up again that was like your my favorite bit of yours pre-elon musk twitter is like every day you'd have a new name
935.32 1008.64 SPEAKER_03  yeah i went from louis liquid to cecil dirtman in 24 hours baby i'm back he took off the concussion tests so he did oh thank god yeah so um in any case people are were like i just more or less more gutted to speak with me but what i got with the gist of it was he was really not doing anything technical no like he he would go like which he says i'm lying about that by the way that specifically if you guys saw the thread that i made the grums thread where i did the i guess kind of a call out thread i just wanted to say one thing about him and i got mad and i kept posting and it turned into a thread um and it was very funny because like he responded to it's the first time in fucking nine months of me haranguing this guy that he finally responds to me and all he does is he unblocks me he goes keep lying and then re-blocks me like a coward and then in the replies to that the only thing that he even was able to say that i was lying out he's like oh he didn't talk to anybody from blizzard they wouldn't have known what i was up to at that point anyway so all the fraud everything that i was like hey look at this weird questionable stuff that's been following this guy around for his entire fucking career he didn't even attempt to to talk about any of that just that
1008.64 1020.32 SPEAKER_05  i was lying about talking to his former employees yeah no and he he won't um but yeah the people the people i talked to like basically like he was just kind of like he would come in with like new toys and
1020.32 1027.22 SPEAKER_03  all that stuff we have his former employees in our fucking discord server by the way yeah they're they
1027.22 1088.10 SPEAKER_05  are all over uh but yeah kabuki card he he would come into blizzard like he you know i'm not gonna say like he had no no part in working on world of warcraft because he did he you know he recruited a lot of the people that made the game but uh when when he ended up becoming a manager because there's there's a book that talks about it i think i shared it in my older threads when i was digging into this but basically he was a co-lead with another guy and then became team lead when that guy got an ulcer and had to drop out and so you know basically they had nobody left to manage and so like all right you're you'll be the the producer manager guy basically is what he got a gamer field promotion pretty much uh but then like as soon as he had more power that's when like apparently things started to get really ugly with him where like you know they had to crunch like he managed like demanded like insane amounts of crunch which he says he wasn't responsible for but everybody that i've talked to that worked under him said he was uh and then you can find that in like a company reviews of his
1088.10 1097.80 SPEAKER_03  he's like very demanding but that's not he also said that i was lying about um saying that he was hard to work with or whatever like that's public information man people just openly say that he's
1097.80 1132.68 SPEAKER_05  an asshole and nobody likes working with him yeah um so yeah he like he would demand people coming on the holidays and then he wouldn't show up himself and so anyways i you know i did a bunch of research on him and figured out like okay this guy's a total fraud like he's not responsible for world of warcraft in the way that he says he is and that led me into uh uncovering you know the other companies that he had made money from because i knew i do known about the red five story because everybody knows about that story um but i didn't know about like mech entertainment where you know he had another million dollars that he pissed away um yeah just really quick for anybody who doesn't
1132.68 1183.34 SPEAKER_03  know that um i don't think we've talked about that specifically on the show although june and i did talk about it when we were on the surfs which um mech entertainment is he got a hundred this this is actually the only cool thing he's ever done i'll give him this he got a million dollars uh in venture capital money took it produced one trailer and then didn't do anything like so he just basically stole that the uncool part about that though is and i don't know how much of this is true you go look in old tweets whatever whoever controlled the voxel nuts that was the game he was ostensibly making whoever controlled that account like called him out and was like yeah he was actually ousted for financial irregularities and he owes his employees money um i posted that in my thread you know it's in a who who knows what the truth of that is that's two people that are complaining about a deal gone bad basically but you know it fits a pattern that's all i'll say yeah um yeah and obviously you know if
1183.34 1202.28 SPEAKER_05  you guys have talked about red vibe on the show you know like he started stage five productions in there and basically funneled a bunch of money towards camera gear and all this other nonsense to film these weird ass marketing campaigns that still exist online and they're fucking weird they're some of the weirdest things i've ever seen yeah they're um very uncomfortable to watch yeah so we have the
1202.28 1210.16 SPEAKER_01  real gamer awards then and so is he involved with this no no no he's not involved with it so that even
1210.16 1269.18 SPEAKER_05  even that one's funny so i guess i'll continue on just a little bit to give context of how i got involved with this yeah so i i after all that research on world of workcraft and what he was doing that's what led me to ember his crowdfunding scam and i started creating a thread documenting in real time on twitter what i was finding uh and maybe i shouldn't have done that maybe i should have just you know gone gone dark and made a whole article or everything but essentially because of how popular he was on twitter i kind of wanted to do it out in the open so that other people would kind of start looking to and finding things that i wasn't seeing crowdsourced intel yeah yeah a little bit and then obviously you know as the story goes i got carried away with a little bit i got a little bit too personally invested into it uh that weird ass giga bear guy uh ended up stalking me after i i thought he was i literally tried to help him i thought he was scammed out of fifteen thousand dollars because all the comments exist that he said he was and then he immediately turned on me and threw me under
1269.18 1284.86 SPEAKER_03  the bus and and said i was lying he made it up yeah listen you can't say this nick i know you can't don't feel the need to comment yeah i think mark paid off i don't give a fuck i think he did i have no proof of that i think that that was bullshit i'll just say it so for those of you who don't know
1284.86 1312.26 SPEAKER_04  it uh he's mark started this this game called ember or started talking about this game called ember what eight years ago nine years ago and he's been crowdfunding off of it for the last however long and uh making a ton of money off of it and this guy giga bear he was someone who donated 15 grand to the project and was very vocally unhappy about it and then agreed to talk to you nick and then no
1312.26 1393.76 SPEAKER_05  no he never agreed to talk to me i just found his comments and then somebody directed him i like i started i the comment that set him off is like wow mark you this guy gave you fifteen thousand dollars and you haven't responded to his comments in two years like what the fuck is this about and then not long after somebody directed you know giga bear caught wind of that and he's like oh i can get a bunch of attention from this and so because he's a you know culture warrior weirdo he threw me under the bus and was like yeah i retracted all these things uh you're lying and i was like wait a second i like these are comments you posted how am i lying like what what really happened here and he wouldn't tell me so i start digging in more and like you're you're now you're going now he's going back and deleting all these comments he said as soon as i found them he started going back and deleting everything and as a journalist i was like wait what the fuck is going on here there's some cover-up going on like did mark pay this guy off this guy like it's this guy mark what's going on here uh and so i start digging into it more and more and like this guy is seriously invested in ember very invested in grums for some reason to the point that like grums ended up banning him from the discord because giga bear was calling out the project and grums alleges that you know he threatened him and all that and then
1393.76 1493.82 SPEAKER_03  grums called the fbi on the guy and everything so just for we're going to pause here for a second sorry nick we'll let you finish but just if you don't know so i know most of our listeners will not the real like hardcore people that hang out in the discord server do know who giga bear is let's just say that there is a like a hundred page ish hundred ish page dossier on him that is like two years old this guy is a known quantity he is uh like a kind of a folk anti-hero in gaming circles like a some sort of like cryptid like a mythological kind of creature um he i like i i'm kind of like obsessed with the guy although once i look like he got he didn't get well we we didn't i i don't allow doxing of any kind in the in the server but like it he got doxed and so it was really easy to find out who he was and i kind of felt bad for him after that so i i i like after that i kind of backed off on it but like the guy is um he's like cybersmith levels of like interesting and i'm not exaggerating he like he got he's not uh the the ember discord is not the first gaming community he's been kicked out of i can't remember what game it was but he was like demanding that the developers uh let him be larger than every other character world of warcraft was that world of warcraft yes he's he's like a gigantism fetish i think is what it is he wants to be larger than every other character and he's like he has this exploits where he he makes his character bigger and wow and he wants in other games he complains when his character can't be larger than all the other characters like he wants to tower over every other gamer grumps team lead
1493.82 1499.58 SPEAKER_01  didn't abide by that he didn't let him be bigger that's like pretty woke uh actually also just bad
1499.58 1505.86 SPEAKER_04  management as a manager you should know to make the loudest guy the biggest guy well with this guy
1505.86 1522.64 SPEAKER_05  this guy's mo is that he he latches on to mmo crowdfunding projects and then he tries to become their biggest fan so that he can be part of the project yeah so and he gets really upset when they don't want him to be part of it because he's fucking crazy that's awesome i kind of respect
1522.64 1556.20 SPEAKER_03  that he also wrote a very good book uh when he got docs we found his book and we're gonna do i think we're gonna do a reading series on it in the server yes what's the actually i don't know if you want to say the title yet but i can't because i don't like i know he's already been docs but i don't want to contribute to that on the air okay since it's been already done all out to happen in the server or whatever but i don't want i don't want to contribute to that but we are going to do some reading time games from it and goddamn it is it is hot it is it is good stuff if you thought
1556.20 1562.52 SPEAKER_01  gigantism was just was that that's just gigantism is it's a classic american story it actually kind
1562.52 1568.32 SPEAKER_03  of reminds me of ghost rider a little bit i'm not gonna lie anyway well enough of that sorry nick
1568.32 1604.68 SPEAKER_05  uh yeah so finally wrap up this long stupid story uh to get to the real game of the real the real ones uh yeah this so basically i was like hot on the case on this thing and i like i felt like i was about to get to crack it wide open and i get a anonymous message from uh what we now know is urinalist or rusty nail in my email and it's basically like i don't know there is no normal fucking person on this planet that uses the word urinalist and so like of course i'm not gonna
1604.68 1610.20 SPEAKER_02  figure out that's the anagram anagram you fucking claw like what if they thought they were so clever
1610.20 1681.42 SPEAKER_05  with that because it's not even a real fucking word so anyways i i get that email and i do the bad journalism thing and get too excited about it and i share it with frost um after well so no i should i get that email and then on twitter giga bear starts talking about how he got axed from another game project and it happens to just line up with this email and so there's a he shares a discord conversation and all this kind of other stuff and i may be misremembering things because it's been a long fucking year uh i i go to my slack and that kind of leads into stuff that happened later i show frost the twitter message frost being your co-worker yes my former co-worker i show for us i show for us the twitter messages that like diga bears like openly admitting he was at removed from this project and then i and i have this guy dead to rights so frost and i both fall for it i post the thing and then giga bear instead if he was smart he would have just left it alone and just let me really dig my hole because i would have probably done it because i was i was being stupid uh but he immediately is like haha i got you and i'm like okay oh obviously i'm wrong here
1681.42 1705.66 SPEAKER_03  i retract this yeah i mean i don't think what i don't understand what the big gotcha was like a source lied to you intentionally in bad faith yeah and that's somehow supposed to like make you look like an asshole i mean the only apology i remember like grum's going in a lot of his weird dorks were like we demand that he retracts and apologize and it's like you'd already done that you know he's like oh yeah like i got lied to like i was wrong sorry like what what do you want in
1705.66 1709.84 SPEAKER_01  that yeah and that's like the awesome part you're right it's like okay damn uh i was just a little
1709.84 1715.68 SPEAKER_03  excited about congratulations uh on lying to me like i don't yeah i didn't understand that
1715.68 1773.06 SPEAKER_05  yeah and like you know i i basically skipped over because i like i haven't done i haven't practiced like real journalism since like before the escape is at this point because we we turned into a commentary and critique site so i hadn't done like a full investigation investigative story or anything like that in a long time um and obviously this was like mostly done on social media so i jumped the gun on that like i openly admitted that and was like i got caught up in this i got too personally attached to it made all the mistakes you should not make as a journalist obviously so i got rightfully roasted for that but also again like there was no how am i supposed to figure out your list is an anagram yeah it's just just just ridiculous they thought that was so clever yep yeah and so yeah that that all happened and then you became gamer hitler to these people pretty much well the thing started to escalate from there because uh grums ended up and that's actually when you and i first started
1773.06 1777.84 SPEAKER_03  talking as i recall was right around this time yeah yeah because not long after grums would accuse
1777.84 1785.26 SPEAKER_05  me of doxing him because somebody shared in our discord uh his working location on an open document
1785.26 1809.18 SPEAKER_03  that anybody can find yeah i'm sorry like i i take a pretty hard line on that in in our service too for just because i don't want the drama but like it's he has the most worst offset i found his cell phone number on accident in like 15 minutes like he is so goddamn stupid he complains about this but it's like his information is everything is just right out in the open well the doc in the document that was
1809.18 1851.22 SPEAKER_05  shared in our discord for one it was i it didn't even have his address on it or anything it was just the uh uh city just like as on his it's literally listed on his indigo koga campaign there was no phone number no email address no address nothing and i had it deleted within 30 seconds so nobody really saw it and so but giga bear was in there and he screenshotted that and then he sends it to grums claiming that i doxed him and that thousands of people had seen it and like we have the we have the analytics in our discord that we can see and it was like seen by 30 people and so he creates this whole fucking narrative about that then he goes on stuttering craig's podcast whatever side scrollers
1851.22 1863.50 SPEAKER_03  side dorks yeah you guys may remember them from when we did the classical music intro when all the gamers were screaming and crying that was uh from side scrollers oh fuck yeah that that's still one of my
1863.50 1907.78 SPEAKER_05  favorite intros that we've done yeah so he goes okay he podcast he goes on um he goes on side scrollers and claims that i doxed him and i threatened his family and i want his family dead and all this other fucking nonsense and i'm in chat sharing the link that he says is doxing him and craig and everybody else ignore it and i'm like you weren't doxed you're being a baby yeah not doxed that is absolutely 100 not doxing yep and i was like if it was please sue me and he never did so he kept proclaiming that i had done all this stuttering craig and blabs and all that didn't push back on him at all so this whole narrative got created that i doxed him and that's when the harassment really started for me uh when i just started getting dogpiled by
1907.78 1924.02 SPEAKER_03  every capital g gamer i know i keep doing this and i'm sorry nick but this is a side note grum's blocked stuttering craig or was it one of the other people from side scrollers recently did you see that trouble in paradise do you know what's going on there uh well i know i know blabs
1924.02 1935.82 SPEAKER_05  has been saying uh he's a scammer now but they won't say it on the air fake friends oh they're all they all are all fake friends they all talk shit about each other yeah i think that they all
1935.82 1947.96 SPEAKER_04  kind of despise each other because they all want to get into a limited space which is take as much money from unsuspecting people like giga bear yeah giga bear is like one of those like it's like
1947.96 1957.44 SPEAKER_03  the the character in zelda there's like secret crab that you can find that you can just keep beating his ass and coins come out of him or whatever like that's what giga bear is to these people you got to
1957.44 1971.12 SPEAKER_05  find he's the giga bag holder yeah he's just yeah he's literally just every day he's he tweets about me he stalks me every fucking day for going on eight months now yeah every day his entire feed is
1971.12 1983.68 SPEAKER_01  me something i wonder about these guys it's like do they get tired of it ever do they ever just like sit down and just like on like like reconcile with what they spend all of their time doing like i don't
1983.68 2009.04 SPEAKER_03  understand like it's it seems so miserable i'm not even a those of you who are inactive in our community will know because you've seen the giga bear docs but if you learn about kind of like what his life is like that's why i was like i feel bad for this guy like you kind of get people let's just say this people who do what he's doing to nick are not happy healthy people right he has to have obsessive compulsive disorder he has yeah there's just no other explanation for it he's got some
2009.04 2063.02 SPEAKER_05  things going on yeah so i i haven't really given him any attention i don't know for five six months now i just you know every time every every time i get a little bit curious i'm like what is he saying about me today i'm like you are just a weird little assistant panda bear and like what he's what he's really trying to do is he's trying to get the attention of the grifters every day so he's documenting everything that i post and trying to send it to them so they make another video about me as he's a little he's a little tattletail rat is what he is uh so yeah all that kind of led into the real game awards where you know craig craig jumped on the whole grums grifter game and that's where his views really started to pop off to if he really started to get involved in that stuff um so basically that's like every single one of those guys making those kinds of videos basically just repeats what grum says because he's getting attention and they know it'll feed to their channel
2063.02 2073.06 SPEAKER_01  too yeah yeah uh i this is such a very incestuous circle jerk basically yeah that's what i say i'm just
2073.06 2113.26 SPEAKER_03  i've just kind of like been running up against this in in new ways there's like an entire cottage industry of like people swimming in grums's wake and um yes they're like all kind of like the like the big like of these like it's like this lower tertiary tier of like guys they're doing the same thing the anti-woke grift yeah like the bigger ones will have like four or five thousand accounts like that the york guy that i've been um hanging out with your new best friend your best friend york the gamer are you are you familiar nick with uh my best friend york no i i see the thing like i
2113.26 2130.78 SPEAKER_05  because i got so wrapped up in it like you know obviously bigger things happen later on that you know i'm sure we'll talk about but i've just like mostly exited that game because one it was affecting my work and two i just like it just makes covering games not fun yeah yeah you don't want to be in
2130.78 2136.56 SPEAKER_04  the mix of it yeah but we don't have that uh we don't have that responsibility so we get to mix it
2136.56 2147.56 SPEAKER_01  up because we're a bunch of big shits yeah i like do you want to talk about york a little bit i've been fascinated by your journey with york the last like week or so love yeah like so there was like a um
2147.56 2223.56 SPEAKER_03  he just made him the what what i was just absolutely i i'm rarely impressed by anything like my i have no dopamine left my brain is so dysregulated i'm not happy you know like we're all fucked everything is bad but he made a meme that was so fascinating to me i was fucking floored by it and it was like uh it was like a list of like famous generals and their accomplishments you know what i mean uh uh and it had i don't know just whatever patent and um civil war generals fucking whatever and then it had grums on there and i thought it was a joke i did not see that yeah it had grums it was the last one was was what a famous general and he was like leading the camera what it said i wish i had it in front of me so fucking bad but it was like leading the the war against like anti-woke game or di games or whatever bullshit they always spew and i was like wait once i had to take a look and i saw his profile and he i was mesmerized this guy this is pure posting his art and he has this like kind of idiosyncrasy that he does in his posts where he starts everything out uh gamers comma and then a line break and then he'll go in on whatever so that's why my name on various social media platforms for the last few weeks has been gamers
2223.56 2257.98 SPEAKER_05  comma yeah yeah i just i just don't understand like this this weird monolith mindset that they have that everybody plays and wants the same things that they do yeah they're the like the just so weird and i gooning borg i i i truth be told i love that name for them for for all the guys that like all the accounts that were like sending me death threats and and attacking and harassing me like i just feel like a lot of them are just bots not even real people like they just don't talk like
2257.98 2273.82 SPEAKER_01  real people at all weird that's why i feel a lot about like these like weird conservative movement movements is like they're not like half the time i've never met a single person in real life ever even debating right-wingers that talks like any of these people i understand that this is problematic
2273.82 2286.22 SPEAKER_04  to say because of the connotations that it's that it's have attached themselves to this phrase over the past couple years but these guys are fucking npcs yeah they really are it's it's hard to
2286.22 2295.78 SPEAKER_01  determine if like it's some it's really hard to figure out if they're bots or not genuinely i i genuinely have that problem sometimes like it's like this person is so stupid it sounds like a robot
2295.78 2396.38 SPEAKER_03  typing that yeah yeah i unfortunately um i do believe that these guys are real because i've been like i've been in the slime lab with these guys for the last few weeks and talking to them um and i don't know like i the thing is that i've learned because they're all um and i'm sure that they do like nominally hold these beliefs right um at least because we're kind of talking about two different things these are like the bottom tier influencers that i'm talking about the yorch types and his his ilk um they maybe nominally hold these beliefs but like they're just running on like autopilot i don't think that they actually really care about this shit they're just trying to rile up the hoople heads for like you know for elon bucks is what they're doing they're trying to like make money and like yorch sells courses um on like how to monetize your gaming profile and that's why i'm like this guy is so awesome and so i've learned that if you don't like you can talk you can engage with them in such creative ways because like unless you like really threaten them or get really mean they won't block you at least me because they see me i have whatever 38 000 followers or whatever like okay this guy's engagement so i can say whatever i want to them and they'll just reply and give me thumbs up and they won't block me and it's so goddamn funny that i took it to the like the furthest extreme that i could where i've just started typing out literal like i've started calling it beast speak where i type out various growls and groans and barks at these guys and he still replies to me because he wants people to see it and get his he's such a fucking servile dog to elon musk thinking he's going to get his like big payday from replying to me that he still is engaging with me it's nuts
2396.38 2428.96 SPEAKER_05  it's crazy you know and you know these guys don't even believe what they're putting out because they end up playing the games anyways like yeah the funniest thing i've seen this week because people are sharing over on blue skies like grums of all people is playing indiana jones and how much time did he spend talking shit about that he spends all this time talking shit about it he calls it woke have you like if he's playing the game it's it's pretty darn woke there's a lot of powerful woman that you partner up with to go explore fucking tombs with is that why that game is i didn't see this one at all it's just no i don't even know what they mean when they say it's woken
2428.96 2462.96 SPEAKER_03  more like you used to like found like a worst screenshot they could have a woman who looks like my like not i inhuman you know what i mean yeah yeah yeah and what was the other one that it turned out he hadn't played there was another game that yeah wukong famously spent yeah he was like all in on this because it's supposed to be anti-woke or whatever uh black myth wukong and then it was revealed after how many months would you say nick fucking six months of him just prattling on about this bullshit or whatever and then just casually replies to emails chong of all people he's like oh i haven't
2462.96 2474.70 SPEAKER_01  played it yet yeah that was like the like anti-woke hero of a game people like anti-woke people were like huge into that game for like a minute that's not a bad game by the way i played it i didn't think
2474.70 2484.64 SPEAKER_03  it was like was i understand why i didn't win game of the year i didn't uh whatever the the astrobots i have not played that so i can't really save but like i thought it was fine it was pretty good game you
2484.64 2554.16 SPEAKER_05  know yeah yeah it's it's it's gorgeous it's fine story is a little nonsensical but uh it really just a very solid action game and uh but like that that's that's kind of why i stopped even bothering covering them in any capacity because it's like it's all meaningless yeah there's just nothing there they're literally like grums just wants the money and that's all he wants and also like you're not you're never going to convince these people that he's wrong because they are so ideologically like driven to support him and that's what i found when i was covering the ember stuff was like i would i would show these people all these receipts and i'm like wait a second i thought i thought gamers were against all these shitty monetization practices that are in the industry um because because that was like my real light bulb moment when i was going through this stuff is like you guys for years have been bitching about microtransactions and life service and and kickstarter scams and all this kind of stuff i was like this thing checks every single box and you're still okay with it so now i just know you are not to be bothered with you you are you don't care as long as this guy says what you like to hear
2554.16 2589.08 SPEAKER_03  yeah that's exactly it he's like the least likely spokesperson for all this and yet and i actually i don't remember i tried to engage stupidly when i had that i had that thread that he the one that he responded to i tried to engage one of them in good faith and um when i was going back and forth with him like he didn't even read my thread of all the stuff the bad stuff he's like i don't care about that he's he's anti-woke that's the only thing that i care about and that's why i like him and he was still trying to like contest trying to get me and he i don't know people were saying like people were transvestigating me people were doing all kinds of crazy stuff yeah the transvestigation i knew was
2589.08 2603.32 SPEAKER_01  awesome uh but that's that that's what you get that was your big mistake is you tried to take one of these guys seriously and then they start transvestigating because like they they're not serious people they don't actually like there's no convincing that's why like that kind of like i'm
2603.32 2611.00 SPEAKER_03  done now i'm only speaking to them in beast speak that's what you guys get i tried yeah and now and
2611.00 2617.48 SPEAKER_01  because not everyone's doing beast speak we have the the real game awards right pretty much yeah that's
2617.48 2623.06 SPEAKER_03  what happens like nick tried to to engage with these people in good faith and now he's gamer hitler
2623.06 2963.88 SPEAKER_05  that's like the funniest part too is like if they actually went through my old tweets and stuff like i've been i've always advocated like you shouldn't you shouldn't like uh a lot of a lot of writers would like constantly use gamer as like a derogatory term like you need to be a little bit careful about that because that is part of your audience like people that do play games so maybe like don't put that target on your back so i've always avoided doing that because i'm like there's you know like i don't want to attract those people by you know derogatory you know using it as a derogatory term because like if you're writing about games unfortunately gamers are your audience yeah you know it's just how much how much you how much time you put into moderate g gamers yeah well and like i have lots of experience with this because i took over the escapist which at the time was the most hated brand in video games like no no questions asked it was the home of our audience at tldr on that really fast yeah so uh i took over the escapist in early 2018 uh but before that the brand was essentially dead it was just being run by yahtzee uh and if you watch any game reviews online you probably heard of zero punctuation um so he was pretty much the only one left by the time her parent company enthusiasts gaming had bought the escapist uh and so when they bought the escapist they brought back a lot of the former escapist team like russ pitts who used to be an editor-in-chief there um bob chipman and a few other people yeah bob himself yeah um and russ pitts ends up getting basically fired because he gets involved at the gamer gate crowd again by writing an article that wasn't really that just a dumb decision about you know ethics and journalism again uh and so they they fired him got rid of him and then they're like you how about do you want to take over the escapist you know like uh i guess let's let's let's let's do it and so i become editor chief i was actually managing editor video for a few months before that um and my first project was actually going to e3 uh and i had never met yahtzee in person before and so uh first of all if you haven't met yahtzee dude's like six five and i'm five nine so and all my editors my video editors that came with us are also like the same height as me so it just looks like he's like walking around like he's our dad leading us around leading us around e3 so uh yeah that's that's our first big project together and like the very first thing i do is set him up with an interview with john romero and he's talked a bunch of shit about john romero's games so we have them film like this little little skit of like john just staring down yahtzee um and that's kind of how i got introduced the escapist audience and like they're like oh yeah you understand the assignment um so we had a really we had a really good like content output from e3 uh and then basically russ gets fired and he essentially had promised a job to somebody that he couldn't even promise a job to so eventually they let that guy go too and then i became editor-in-chief um and so my my job was to rebuild that brand from the ground up and make it not hated um so that sounds like a crazy horrible task i'll be honest it was uh really scary because like my my websites had a few hundred thousand you know users every every month but i had never worked on the scale of a million subscriber youtube channel and also as far as i knew a channel that would be extremely hostile to any games journalist coming in because of the gamer gate audience um so my five years running the escapist was like rebuilding the team there uh rebuilding the content output introducing people to a new audience really helping yahtzee break out of his shell because he had never really worked with a team before um and then just endless and endless and endless amounts of moderation to my goal was essentially make room for the silent majority of normal people that actually want to talk about games and not culture worship and so we we actually achieved that and then uh after gamers uh well enthusiast gaming sold us to gamers and i worked uh on escapist for one more year under gamers and then gamers fired me uh and that's how second wind got started but like our community that exists on second wind is the escapist community uh that what we built over the year which became a super positive yeah super positive friendly kind community that like have very different political opinions across the board but it's a normal space to be in where you can be a liberal person can be in there with a conservative and they will have a conversation and it not try to kill each other that genuinely does like that's not common these days no no like at all it takes endless amounts of moderation on my part like i like i i became obsession uh in a bad way where i would respond to things and all that and i've you know i've gotten over that over the years but um like we were we we had to be so careful with the escapist where one article one video whatever one comment that would be taken out of context from like the larger games industry or games media could have sank us um and all the reputation that we built and so you know we got we got we we had a really good team that all believed in the vision that we wanted to build with that and like build something that like i want to be able to talk about my freaking hobbies online and not be attacked every five seconds and like we we built that that's amazing it must be
2963.88 2978.34 SPEAKER_04  so difficult though to keep that equilibrium in a in industry that is like for whatever reason become like a nexus of this sort of like crazy culture war bullshit
2978.34 3034.54 SPEAKER_05  uh yeah it can be it can be really difficult um especially like you know when people make hit pieces hit piece videos about you and then those people all show back up or whatever um the the current like state of culture war and all that has made it really difficult because they just anything you talk about they're there anything it doesn't matter what game what topic completely unrelated they'll come in and try to comment on things uh but good news is youtube has a lot of really good filtering options and so when you moderate as much as i do you kind of learn their keywords because they all talk the exact same way and so like pc you can literally just you can filter these people out because they all use the same words every single one of them and so we really don't even see it anymore on second wind that's good uh you know all the all the normal slurs that
3034.54 3041.34 SPEAKER_03  they love to use obviously uh but i mean your top 10 most most filtered slurs that is not what i was
3041.34 3048.52 SPEAKER_05  asking you know what i think i think the internet would have a real reason to cancel me if i did that
3048.52 3055.82 SPEAKER_01  uh but like just they the gamer awards would shift you into the best journalists of the year awards
3055.82 3105.58 SPEAKER_05  after that uh you know like dei for example anybody that comes in and comments with that you just know they're not doing anything smart with it yep the dei esg all the different ways they spell journalists all the different ways they spell woke there's all kinds of uh it's it's very fascinating i should send you guys a screenshot of it because they have different ways to spell all these different things and it gets more stupid the longer it goes on because they keep trying to get around the comment filters because they know they exist it's like it's like on tiktok when people say sewer slide yeah i love that one yeah i could i could do a whole podcast and just how fun it is to moderate dummies yeah okay um let's see do we want to explain what the real game awards are
3105.58 3109.86 SPEAKER_03  yeah as i say do we want to do that real quick we got about yeah let's go through the categories i want to
3109.86 3122.14 SPEAKER_01  i want to know what the categories are and like what's what's going on here yeah and how it's going to take over the the the fake old lame gamer awards yeah this is the real one because the the original game
3122.14 3162.62 SPEAKER_03  awards i guess are soy and gay um so we're on to the real game awards you have to pay 30 to vote in uh first up the real game awards best action game so of course we got stellar blade uh we got black myth wukong space marine 2 final fantasy uh i don't know which one are we on now i don't know how to read roman is it the seven remit is it the revert yeah and then indiana jones um which indiana jones is by the way kind of doing a u-turn there they're deciding that it is no longer woke it is based i don't know why as long as they like the game it's not woke yeah it was like when barbie came
3162.62 3183.34 SPEAKER_01  out and all the like all the conservatives were like this is like anti-woke thingy and then like everyone loved the movie and like in the in the same breath after they were like yeah we hate the wokeness in media but we really love this movie uh it was actually a great thing to bring your family to like they just do that in the same like instantaneously they'll shift yeah there's a couple
3183.34 3213.84 SPEAKER_03  of like i guess ostensibly normal categories we're going to skip that and get into the freak shit um waifu of the year no they're gooners no yeah this is the good stuff of course we've got eve from stellar blade she's gonna sweep she's stellar blade is gonna sweep this thing um we've got tiffa from and it's because grums ended wokeness yeah uh bernice from zenless zone zero i've not heard of that or played it but it got very horny yeah zenless zone zero is the game that is that
3213.84 3218.52 SPEAKER_04  came out to do that there was like all this controversy about today so so it's a gotcha
3218.52 3228.22 SPEAKER_05  game i think it's a phone game am i right or am i wrong no it's a it's a it's like a roguelike action game on consoles too okay but it's from the same people that made gengin impact apparently
3228.22 3237.98 SPEAKER_04  they they they did an update that did not allow you to like basically do upskirts as easily they like made the characters turn kind of transparent when you looked at them from certain angles that's
3237.98 3242.96 SPEAKER_03  what we were talking about okay yeah so so grums that was grums flipped out and then within hours
3242.96 3249.62 SPEAKER_04  they like patched it because they're so we did it read it loud idiots so now you can look up the skirts
3249.62 3267.90 SPEAKER_03  of the of you can look up bernice's skirt now and in this photo what i find very funny is like her uh her breasts are soaking sopping wet for some reason none of the rest of her skin is the rest of her skin looks normal but her like reflective light off of her breasts which is very funny
3267.90 3272.86 SPEAKER_01  it sucks that these people have to appeal to just horny perverts like this jesus christ
3272.86 3286.84 SPEAKER_03  yeah and the last is juliette from the lollipop chainsaw repop i don't know what that is but she's got pigtails in her hair so if you vote for that you are a pedophile i think okay i think she is
3286.84 3295.28 SPEAKER_04  in high school lollipop chainsaw was written by james gunn actually and it's again it's another remastered game from like a decade ago something like that yeah that came out i remember that when i was
3295.28 3305.36 SPEAKER_03  like in high school wasn't james gunn didn't he is it real or is that is that woke uh anti-woke guys calling him a pedophile he had some dicey stuff didn't he you know here's the deal with james
3305.36 3355.56 SPEAKER_04  gunn so i don't know if you guys are familiar with trauma the movie studio they made the toxic avenger but their whole thing was that they made these like unbelievably crude disgusting sort of like comedy horror movies in the 80s and 90s and up to the early 2000s that's where james gunn cut his filmmaking teeth so his whole thing like everything he started out doing before he like went mainstream was like gross out horror and like really sort of crude like comedy with lots of nudity in it and so in like the early 2010s like right when twitter started he like made a couple of like edgelord jokes where it would be like where the punchline was like oh i'm i'm having sex with someone who's underage and like they aren't funny but like they were obviously jokes it was obviously
3355.56 3365.22 SPEAKER_03  not like to be titillating it was so it's like if somebody found my old like blog from when i was a teenager where i was doing edgy jokes and they were like wow caleb what's this even though yes that's
3365.22 3371.84 SPEAKER_04  exactly what it was like and he apologized of course and i feel like it got him taken off of a movie for a
3371.84 3424.00 SPEAKER_03  while it did he was supposed to be uh was it uh guardians of the galaxy he got fired from that but then he got rehired to it so yeah okay well happy ending i suppose uh there's a bunch of other normal ones let's get to them to the meat of the videos because we really could do like an entire episode about this and it would be fun but we're already um rounding home on this one so we've got uh the worst games journalist then we'll go to the best uh the worst games journalist the stars are here the stars are out tonight we've got alyssa mercante uh paul tassi tassi tassi tassi paul tassi i don't know him he's the one uh who is not my twitter mutual so i don't know if i want you to win or lose because of that paul but uh you know you you're down the rank uh then we've got nick and we've got rebecca valentine who i i've never spoken to but we are our our mutuals so really heavy hitters here
3424.00 3431.68 SPEAKER_01  um i i'll be honest i i'm about to donate my 30 to vote in this yeah um i thought you were
3431.68 3437.92 SPEAKER_03  bankrupt well you're gonna go into debt not for not for gaming i'm gonna western kabuki patreon money
3437.92 3446.50 SPEAKER_05  yeah we gotta stop doing our uh financial transparency on second wind all in i sent the
3446.50 3478.88 SPEAKER_01  leap i'm in the leap tier i sent one thousand three hundred dollars oh no uh who you voting for uh you know probably just uh i have to really consider the options here okay i think the person who um would cause the most stress among all these people so probably like no offense i don't know enough about this this here but i feel like well you see i guess they want the most the person who will cause the most stress they probably want

3899.98 3916.92 SPEAKER_03  least listenable podcasts of all the research i think i said this on the episode that we use their shit i i literally look at like hitler stuff and gore and and conspiracy theories for this show and i had a harder time getting through side scrollers than i think anything that i've ever
3916.92 3980.50 SPEAKER_05  had to for any of this shit yeah my my last interaction with like the whole gamer great crowd was going on to his podcast to talk about the real game awards because i was like i want to know what this is yeah and he basically you know egged me on and then he didn't tell me when i came on to the show before i came on the show that melanie mack was going to be there because oh yeah so that was a really oh unfortunately did she eat butter in front of you i don't know what she was doing off camera she might have been i can't believe i can't believe she fucking did that so anyways i'm like i'm on this podcast and i'm like i'm questioning them about the real game awards and i'm also like one of the big conspiracy theories that went around was uh that seven million dollar payout to uh the studio behind blackbath wukong that like a dei consulting agency extorted them of seven million dollars yeah so i go on the podcast and i'm like how can you prove this and i was like they're like well no we were just talking about it was like no you said it happened well that's not our job to prove it happened i was like but you said it happened like it is that
3980.50 3989.90 SPEAKER_03  is your job if you say that then your job is to back that claim up yeah someone else says it you can talk about it sure but if you're the original source of the claim you gotta back that well they
3989.90 4002.04 SPEAKER_05  weren't even the original source but they were like confirming it on their show well that's just yeah and so like it's just they're like it's not our responsibility and i just i'm sitting there questioning them on everything and they think they're like sitting there thinking they won after
4002.04 4008.92 SPEAKER_03  i leave the show yeah did you consider that it it it like i guess substantiated their narrative it felt
4008.92 4025.64 SPEAKER_05  true to them they they if they if you told them the earth was flat they would go try to find it and then find out it's around and still tell you it's flat yeah like that guy that just went to antarctica and to prove it to himself the world is flat i saw that in front of the show yeah um but as
