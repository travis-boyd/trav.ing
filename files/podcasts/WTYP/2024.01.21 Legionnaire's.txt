hi what no oh no oh that's a kill yeah hey welcome welcome to where there's your problem
uh not being recorded under duress i should i should i can't state that clearly enough
this is a bonus you know who we are but we have a guest yes i am a guest my name is emily schick
and i'm here because i know about tiny living things oh emily we have you on today because
we want to know why those bureaucrats in washington won't let us drink the condensation
yes exactly right you know it's just like you just look at a cooling tower and you're like
man i could really use a drink right what a delicious i must lick the forbidden popsicle
it's like a nice warm shower you know yeah a warm tasty shower tepid kind of like and the thing is
right the best kind of water and i've often said this is standing water oh yeah you don't want any
of that you don't want any of that lazy flowing water you want standing water you should trust
yes if it's exactly dude if if it's yellow it's mellow you know it's mellow for you that's the
saying yeah yes yep if it's brown drink it down you know oh god drink the poop water
you just stick your whole head in this in this hot tub yeah this podcast is not fda approved
drink your way out what do they call that shit the like on like that the tech bros were doing a few
years ago when they were all drinking water out of creeks and all getting sick do you remember that
raw water yeah yeah yeah yeah as a person as a person who works at a drinking water lab
that horrifies me they were gonna like come to your lab and like drink all of your samples
yeah let me make sure i'll i'll make sure to give them all the ones that are e coli positive because
the rain has given us a lot of that this year delicious i love e coli in rain that that's
yeah all right well you know it's animals poop on the ground and water washes it right into all of
your drinking water sources all right new new proposal give me a billion dollars to create a
system of litter boxes for wild animals the filthy motherfuckers you can't i like to think of them as
toby holes we're gonna we're gonna teach the deer to use shovels like they're on a national park
because deer are often in national parks yeah uh remember uh tying it back to another episode
execute all deer yeah that's right yeah if we killed all the deer there will be less coliform bacteria
in the rainwater under uh fully automated luxury gay space communism there will be a toilet for every
animal's home or burrow running water listen if we can do that for like most humans i think we can
do that for um for animals yeah yes we cannot do that for most humans we can do that for some
like i think it's like two and three maybe don't quote me on that that's most humans hey winning ugly is
still winning all right number number number of humor number of toiletless humans uh
uh toilets that's my one political axiom is that every person deserves to poop in a toilet
no but only about 40 percent of people have a flushing toilet oh wow wow
4.5 billion people do not have a toilet we will we will we will cancel the f-35 and build toilets
everywhere we should we should probably like first of all uh fix that before we do any of the like
why don't we give people toilets people into shit places give people yeah you can join engineers
without borders they go to like uh remote villages and stuff and install water systems
hell yeah i like the idea of engineers without borders that also install like pc like gaming pcs
like on the side you're like yeah you gotta do the water first then you can do the electricity
then you do the wi-fi then it's it's like poop water cooled pcs yeah of course network engineers
without borders just like hooking you up with like a 49 gamers without borders gamers without borders
we we could commit we could we could get like as specific as we can what is that in the french
uh like the most the most specific like subfield like cyber security engineers without borders
you know um just like you go around the world to like war torn areas and get people to change
their wi-fi password um you like sort of tell people not to use fingerprint id on their phone
um the other thing is that like gamers saw frontiers yeah gamers saw jouers sans frontiers um
i i genuinely believe that like if not a majority at least a plurality of people had access to a
toilet and that's because i've been like drinking the kool-aid of like libs who are like look at
this graph where it goes big up isn't that like you know capitalism yeah capitalism is responsible for
like lifting more people out of poverty than any other ideology and then you i want to see the i want
to see the gamers without borders um advertisement you know when we came to the small african village
these children couldn't read now they can play madden yeah they still can't read but they are much
more racist i i i think the thing is right every time i think oh that would be a good idea to have
on a shirt or whatever it sends us into the spiral of trying to like have shirts made and sell them
but i genuinely think we should sell a gamers without borders shirt i'm gonna admit to something
embarrassing please in 2005 uh a a subgroup of of bungee fans developers of halo sold hurricane katrina
relief shirts and i owned a halo fans for hurricane relief shirt i mean listen master chief wouldn't
want you to die in a hurricane and that's it said stop the flood remember the villain oh funny okay
halo fans against the flood yeah it was actually pretty good yeah uh we're gonna sell gamers without
border shirts the worst shirt that i own is a shirt that i got when i was 18 and held on to
uh when i was in the labor party uh like lgbt the lgbt labor like pride london um marching group
and it says only the labor party can deliver equality that's the worst piece of clothing that i still own
um that's my worst shirt that's an ironic shirt now it is yeah yeah i think i purged yeah so you
no that's not my worst shirt my worst shirt is an amy klobuchar amy for america shirt which i did buy
as a joke why because she's hot oh my dad my dad once said that amy klobuchar was the kind of person
my mom would want me to marry and i have never been able to decode that one baffling not sure
that i want to all right worst worst shirts worst shirts go ross let's go i'm trying to think
you don't really have any offensive ones yeah no i always steer clear from that yeah
you have you have a worst hat the one that says the piss tape is real yeah i have the piss tape is
real hat um i do have that one uh you were talking like wine yeah you were taking talking about the
other hat i was still yeah i was talking about the other hat but you know i'm so pleased to like have
have serendipitously discovered the piss tape is real hat yes i have a the piss tape is real hat
we have the discourse hat which details of which are not being released at this time wearing wearing
the piss tape had to like jury do you see yeah
they never pick me anyway i may as well give them more reasons not to
i have myself i love that i've had to buy my own merch several times
mm-hmm yeah i'm about to do it again i'm about to buy a poster for the live show
um which is do we want to hype up the live show real quick
yeah go for it
uh the live show is on september the 12th because we could not book 9-11
at franklin music hall there will be details on our twitter account we're doing it with
minion death cult and the antifada we're doing like a sort of like multi show within a show
uh it's gonna be cool i'm gonna edward snowden my way over there i'm afraid because we couldn't
figure out what the hell kind of visa to get me yeah i know so if you are an immigration lawyer
then please go ahead and reach out otherwise uh come to franklin musical in the evening i think
it's like doors that like i don't remember when the fucking doors are for one night only it will
be franklin podcast hall mm-hmm that's right you really needed to shoehorn that joke in there didn't
you yeah i think it'd be funny if they did it
yeah he put it in the group chat too 60 of the world's population do not have a joke like that to
sit on i think that's that's disgraceful yeah it really is capitalism has a joke that's
has taken 60 of podcasts out of uh podcasters without borders no no no no we don't deserve
we barely deserve to breathe oxygen like let alone it would be funny if we were like hey starving
small african child you want to talk about the engineering disaster that is your country's economy
when we when we came to this village this child couldn't read now he's a swedish italian man
oh my god okay this is a bonus we're we're just sucking down time you paid for this idiot
oh yeah i'm here for it though this is this is gold thank you but you know this is about though
we're talking about horrifying little little creatures little bugs yeah yeah you know and
the thing is they they live on uh your skin there are like millions of them on you constantly and
the that's because you're not clean enough and if you just like
i shouldn't make other people's mental health worse where whenever i post something about health
anxiety and anyone's like jokingly like oh you have rabies now i just block them so i really just
have like a double standard sounds like it's time for it to rub the lotion on its skin or else it
gets the bacteriums again fun fact there's more bacterial cells in your body than there are you cells
oh yeah just that that's a fun thing to help you sleep at night bunch of little hedgehikers
yeah they don't even pay rent yeah yeah actually they also make your body work so you know very real
way all of us are landlords yeah we are the rentier class for bacteria yes and yet i get paid nothing
yeah cheap bastards yeah all right speaking of uh bacteria that like to live on and in us uh
we're talking about legionella today and this came up as an idea in my mind because i was like
hmm philly oh yeah legionella i love i love this this little art that you've you've done here
it's fantastic delicious spreadable legionella oh yeah i mean it is spreadable it's very spreadable
you have to say that for it yep biofilms uh you could totally spread on toast
i i mean i i meant transmissible but you know what that's a horrifying new realization
yep uh yeah you you should see the biofilms that these things can form it's pretty impressive
i don't really want to see the biofilms that i i get a sense i might be about to in the course of
the next like hour or two but yeah we'll see uh so let's talk a little bit about what legionella is
so what is a legionella uh it's sort of like the rockettes but for the american legion
yeah please welcome on stage the legionellas yes
they come out like high kicking doing a can-can but oh god can you imagine what your immune system
looks like after their can-can oh that would be amazing uh in fact it's a genus of gram-negative
bacteria that does that mean so oh so if you spread the biofilm on a gram cracker then
no no i don't i know my gram crackies and that's not how that works i don't know what gram negativity
is oh okay so gram negative and gram positive are basically you have a basic stain that divides
bacteria into two basic groups one of them holds on to the first stain and one of them doesn't so one
ends up with the counter stain so one is purple and one is pink it's basically it it's a difference
in the way that their cell walls are constructed in short short answer but is this pink style or purple
style this is pink style oh for her that's why it's legionella you know yeah oh yeah not just legionelle
maybe maybe it's uh maybe she's born with it maybe it's legionnaires
uh so legionella typically lives in freshwater sources uh and contains more than 50 species at
least 30 of which can cause disease in humans and the one we're primarily talking about here is
legionella pneumophila which is legion thing that likes lungs oh yeah
do lungs like it back i sense not nope nope they sure don't uh yep not a great thing to be in your
lungs um and this is an obligate intracellular pathogen which basically means that it doesn't
just sort of float around in your body like other bacteria it can only reproduce when it's within one
one of your cells so in people specifically it tends to do this in your macrophages which are one of
your white blood cells which its normal job is to go eat things like dead cells and debris and bacteria
but the legionella likes to basically go you know what i'm not gonna let you dissolve me because
that's what it usually does it goes i'm just gonna chill in here until i reproduce to a point where i
make you explode and then it moves on and finds new macrophages and continues this is this is like
being a criminal who is like escaping the surge by hiding inside a cop basically
you guys ever see the thing except like it's it's also reproducing so one criminal goes in and then
like no it's like a clown car all right so cop exploding full of criminals gotcha yes yep
it is really cool uh so it's like the police union gets hold of this it's like sick leftist podcasters
want our law enforcement officers to be exploded from the inside by dozens of criminals
yeah i could get down with that allegedly um anyway in minecraft to be for it not to be
a parody in minecraft parody in minecraft uh so in the wild this generally does this to amoeba and
other protozoa but you know it it'll it'll take human cells it's cool with it um it's just like wow
big amoeba yeah take a deep breath let's experiment let's do this all right
oh yeah so in water they generally like to form biofilms but they can be free floating
and it turns out that they really really love doing this in human built things like water heaters
hot tubs fountains ac units hot tubs scare the shit out of me for this exact reason yeah yeah don't get
in the hot tub do not get in the hot tub someone has just don't walk by it in there yeah put the
chlorine in it's fine and that's how ross died of legionnaire's disease
doing world war one trench warfare on my hot tub like i'm firing mortar shells full of chlorine gas at
it and watching it roll over the landscape it's like there's so much chlorine in my pool that i have
accidentally killed myself but at least it won't be from legionella i mean listen some people say it's
not a valid lifestyle choice to be wearing a full respirator in the hot tub and those people lack
vision absolutely because of the chlorine yes yeah so they like hot tubs in particular because they're
fond of warm temperatures and you know it's they're happiest around 35 degrees celsius or about 95 in
freedom units and that is notably pretty close to human body temperature oh yeah it's it's uh toasty
it's warm and they like stagnant water but they also just like to hang out in warm water pipes in
places like office buildings so oh okay yeah so in my former life as an environmental scientist i used to
do legionella sampling in a large office building and they would generally have some in things like
the showers that they have from that people can use after the gym or whatever and never enough to
really make anyone sick but you know with an aerator they have to actually check these things because
they've just got it like chilling now now i have two reasons not to use the gym shower yeah i just jog home
and shower there it's an extra workout it's fine exactly it's usually not a problem in homes because
the water is circulating and cycling often enough that it doesn't get a chance to sit but you know if you
have say a pandemic happen and you know the showers don't get used for a while
yeah yeah yeah your modern office building has like a hot water circuit as opposed to just direct hot
water pipes i would imagine it's become less of a problem in newer buildings yeah i think it is but
you know there's still plenty of those older buildings maybe
so normally we don't we legionella is not normally a problem when it's in its natural environment because
the levels don't get high enough to affect like actually infect humans yeah it's busy taking out amoebas
and stuff exactly but yes we don't eat each other's amoeba bodies yeah yeah it turns out we're really good at
building things that they are super happy living in we like to be toasty they like to be toasty
exactly they you know the the amoeba also live in there and they go this is pretty sweet and uh
oh lungs uh oh yeah the idea i i i know that they're not flesh-eating bacteria but like i don't i i
don't i'll fuck with it hmm yeah uh not a fan
uh the good news is that human to human transmission is exceedingly rare and we only really see outbreaks
from contaminated environmental sources yeah unless you're like french kissing a big sort of like
thing of like dirty water back and forth right oh my kink is spitting out is you know the hot dog
water in the hot dog machines getting water boarded in the hot tub yeah i like i like water play but
only for hot dog water oh god your dirty water dog is probably at a higher temperature than the hot tub
though dirty water dog is like something a frustrated australian would call you no no no that's what
they call the hot dogs in new york city really yeah the because they're in the pot of dirty water
that sits there but the dirty water is actually spices it's not actually dirty um okay well i and
spices like to like inhibit growth of stuff too so that's fine yeah it's sealed so whatever
absolutely so yeah the disease that this causes is called legionellosis and that started as
isn't it though it started as two separate diseases so i have a bunch of slides for this in the form of
a joke uh so if we if we skip forward a bit i had a you had a slide of like uh legionella doing what it's
doing we had a slide of uh this thing taking out a macrophage from the inside out which is kind of
cool and gross um it's like the one back wait which one oh this one yeah that that's that that's
macrophages getting like uh by the legionella oh ew oh no no no no no no no no finally our first it's not
supposed to look like that on this one um uh and then i got four more the next four slides are one
very weak visual joke about the two diseases that legionella causes so please yeah keep going justin
yeah it causes legionellosis which is not named for that guy all these guys this guy or that guy again
all these guys again all these guys and pontiac fever which is not named after this yeah oh my god
is this a disney world i don't know i just googled like hot pontiac yeah i i'm gonna oh this is
gonna be a risky search hot man if i see it's mostly hot rods it's mostly hard there's no like cars 2
fan fiction or anything up there you know there's a slam 70 firebird trans am oh daddy
i don't have trans am but mostly just i can switch the badge around to amtrand and be cool
yeah hang on one second that's awesome okay yeah keep going i'm gonna look at
i get a trans am like fiber tattoo yeah liam needs a little uh liam time
what slide should we be on i'm uh well i got through i got through the joke about
how it causes legionellosis which is not named for the roman legions the french foreign legion
caesar's legion and pontiac fever which is not named for pontiacs so now we're on slide nine which
is going to explain legionellosis to us next one after this yeah yeah yeah this one that's what
your lungs should look like right yeah she she feel on my pneumo till i uh die
yeah lung lung lung speed the old delson rockefeller yes oh yeah whichever rockefeller died with his
mistress i don't care it doesn't matter so there are two different kind things that legionellosis does
for you so one is a nasty form of pneumonia which causes fun symptoms such as a high fever
coughing difficulty breathing and gi symptoms and that takes about two to fourteen days after you get
infected and the fatality rate with treatment on that one is about five to ten percent
and that is similar to other forms of pneumonia but i mean pneumonia it kills you but it kills you
pretty easily i think william also called it the old man's friend because it like if you're really sick
it's usually the thing that like proximately takes you out absolutely yeah it's yeah usually elderly
immunocompromised like the kind of the the everything takes out those people though
but yeah but this is this is like something that's like deadly enough to do that and also you if you're
not careful oh yeah i mean this one really like sets itself apart from other forms of pneumonia
because its mortality in the untreated is higher than other pneumonias and is about 40 to 80 percent
this is the normal 30 percent yeah i mean you can kind of get by with some cases of pneumonia if
you're like otherwise healthy just not knowing you have pneumonia like kind of thinking you have like
the worst cold in the world and then you're just kind of like okay yep it's referred to as walking
pneumonia because it's not literally landing you in bed you can actually still kind of function
mm-hmm
had it once don't recommend
yeah i mean i you can see the extremely cool x-ray here
they should not look like that
no um you that's bad i would say i looked at a bunch of different x-rays of uh people with legion
and losis for this to like you know decide which one i want to put in uh they're all pretty gnarly
oh yeah i don't know what one that looks right is supposed to look like so essentially what you
would be looking at is one that isn't like a clue it doesn't look like cloudy yeah
they're supposed to be black because they're supposed to be like filled with you know air
flash space yeah what you're looking at is like a lot of uh like dead lung tissue and like phlegm and
stuff and also like um because it's like the alveoli in the lungs that like uh sort of like getting
attacked here and they're like swelling up and then like you know dying um
it's just full of nasty uh what are the alveoli uh the alveoli are the little like breathing sacks
uh i'm doing air quotes here um that uh like on the end of you know the things that your lungs
that your bronchioste tubes like branch out into and they do the gas exchange okay thank you
yeah no worries they're pressing on all human beings except italians who have raviolis
all of my fucking aioli is getting inflamed it's fucking terrible you're just coughing up sauce
i have the pneumonia
yeah so it's like alveoli they look like little tiny like i don't even remember how to describe
little lumpy sacks but look kind of like if you had like um like little tiny like sacks of grapes
or whatever yeah exactly they look kind of like grapes they're they're basically there so that you
can increase the surface area so you get more efficient gas exchange
bodies love to like increase surface area in fun ways um oh they sure do
i i uh i prefer what i not to increase my surface area but i'm really good at doing it anyway
it's like a skill issue thing yeah
like when i need to you know respiration digestion um cognition any of that stuff you know um
yeah yeah all right so this this fucks you up is the main thing about it yeah basically so
the really fun part about this is that the frequency and size of outbreaks have been increasing as have
the number of sporadic cases climate change really is cool oh awesome i didn't even think about that
yeah i put that in as another little bonus slide at the end that we'll get to uh i put in some cdc data
yay it's these guys yeah this is the legion it's the american legion not not rome or like the fake
roman fall at new vegas or france yes these guys so in 1976 the city of philadelphia was celebrating
america's 200th birthday even though she didn't look a day over 150. go birds
go birds indeed mm-hmm i'm fascinated by this guy on the front row left the shape of his chin
it's incredible yeah it really is so much going on there but yeah so these guys in the hats um uh
uh we're doing a party yeah they were doing a party and this party happened to take place at the
belfew strafford hotel i mean here's the thing right if you're doing if you're doing like veteran
stuff in in 76 or whatever like look at everyone's a veteran there was there was a draft like it seems
try hard to me you know that's my firm stance it's gonna get people very mad at us it's like no if you
fought in world war ii and you want to commemorate it in any way you're a loser it's like being like
oh you never got over what you did in high school everyone went to world war ii it's more like just
a social club for dudes to hang out and it's still okay yeah oh yeah it's still around the uh then
there's a bunch of them oh yeah i'll be like shows with cheap beer and uh no one checking your id
yeah hardcore shows with bands that are yeah yeah shit i mean okay i perfectly reverse my opinion on
these guys then yeah they just have a 100 serious stance that every american veteran of world war two
was a loser yeah no it's a bunch of bunch of guys a bunch of guys get together they buy a shed they put a
shitty bar in it they have a stage in there and they hang out you know um and you know i i haven't
been to one of these places in a very very long time but i last time i was in one of them it was like
yeah you could smoke in here smoke wherever you want it's like wait really okay okay
this is a nice hotel though yeah it's a nice looking how do we characterize this like architecturally
this is second empire nice yeah um yeah the bellevue stratford hotel um i know it for a different
disaster than this actually although i didn't know about the legionnaires outbreak which is
the reason why i was employed for a while was mostly because of the facade inspection ordinance
right the reason for this facade inspection ordinance is sometime in the early 2000s
a corbel fell off of the cornice up here straight down to the sidewalk ooh and so this is something
that had happened on a lot of buildings of this era over time right but this time it fell on a judge
and killed him instantly i would have assumed so yeah whack them right on the noggin uh pretty bad
that's tough and city council was like we need to act on this problem which has been happening for
several decades now and instantly passed the facade inspection ordinance now you got to inspect the
facades every five years of anything over six stories because below six stories a giant stone is
actually harmless if it falls on your head um i mean in fans there's a lot of facade on this facade
like there is a lot of facade on this facade this is um although this is not the worst one i've seen
in terms of trying to diagram the thing because you can get away with like a flat uh drawing here i think
there's some which are much worse oh i'm sure well i didn't even know about that so it turns out that
you really just don't want to be on the sidewalk outside this place for any reason ever first hotel
all right it's fine i've walked by it like hundreds of times and i haven't even been killed once
well your time is coming raz yeah i feel like you're just pushing your luck there although hopefully
maybe they actually like treat their hvac units again so uh in so after this convention was over and
actually even during the convention well you said two to 14 days latency right so yeah exactly so
221 people at this convention got sick or actually not even just at this convention why did i call it
latency like your illness yeah yeah i mean that's that's actually the correct terminology so i see i know
the stuff without even knowing it exactly you're great at it you're an expert yeah so uh 34 of those
people or approximately 15 died and the real fun part is that they it wasn't just the legionnaires it
was also other people staying in the hotel and not even people just staying in the hotel people who
walked by the hotel on the sidewalk what's hell wow we'll get uh yeah good times right yeah so
they're they're presumably they're getting like bro walking pneumonia as distinct from like you know
any other pneumonia that anyone's ever seen um pneumonia achieved by walking yes yeah yeah this is a score
this is a this is a score against uh walkable urbanism right here that's right that's kind of
mixed use walkable pneumonia it's actually illegal
yeah so the cdc decided to join this party when a local physician diagnosed several patients with a
pneumonia that didn't respond to normal antibiotics because that's not terrifying
yeah it's 1976 there's like two antibiotics and then in the next 10 years they invent another like
10 and those are all of them now well i mean break them if you break them down if you kind of lump
them into classes yeah pretty much yeah yeah you can you can't like anytime i think about antibiotic
resistance i get very very scared but then i'm like yeah you know it's fine something i can do about
it let it ride baby yeah what do you what do you what do you want me to do about it you know
they'll they'll try and fucking uh do some like ai enabled drug discovery if they aren't already and
that's gonna be all these like antibiotic resistic bacterias that are like of very serious diseases
when they come up when they evolve into an antibiotic resistant version it's like okay it's good at
resisting antibiotics but only because it has uh developed all these sort of hapsburg qualities that
make it very difficult to actually function as a disease oh yeah you did tell me this that's that's
sort of true but like kinda yeah like a lot of the stuff well like for instance if you take mrsa uh
methylcoxin resistance yeah method something resistant resistant
methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus thank you um yeah if you if you take that it'll kill you
um it's it's pretty good at that actually um and so it's a for a sort of very dangerous hospital-borne
infection a lot of the time um oh yeah and there's an even more terrifying version of that now which is
called versa it's a vancomycin resistant staphylococcus aureus now we're down to the last sort of trench
yeah yeah mycomycin is like the drug of last resort because like you might survive but you
might not have like a liver or kidneys anymore so it's not great when things become resistant to that
you can you can do some fun stuff with like um xdrtb as well extremely drug resistant tuberculosis
um so yeah i think it's probably bad that we haven't like we discovered like a new antibiotic class like
a couple of years ago and we're like but basically we kind of stopped all research into that because
it wasn't very profitable and no one was paying anyone to do it um and i i think maybe that's bad
oh yeah it's it's incredible like you look at like the covet vaccine and it was like yeah we developed
this technology that's supposed to be 20 years off in like a year um yeah and the answer was just
give give them all of the money they want the money yeah there's some interesting stuff going on uh
porting down right now with the like 100 day thing where the the deal is that like um their
sort of objective with it is if there is disease x like something completely like outside context
something completely unknown to have a vaccine for it workable within a hundred days i think that's
amazing um so you know but yeah between like us not paying for any like new antibiotic discovery and
the soviet union who are the only people investing in phage therapy uh not existing anymore it's it's a
good time to be uh bacteria yeah i mean the other thing that really doesn't help us is the fact that
most of our antibiotics are developed from bacteria's own resistance to other bacteria's like yeah because
most antibiotics are produced by other bacteria so but the other fun thing is that bacteria can
transfer genes they can just sort of like do a little handshake thing and it's like hey man are
you resistant to this oh no do you want to be sure just hanging out yeah i mean sisterhood of the
traveling pants type situation yeah exactly yeah changing jeans just just like putting putting the
hate you so much dude just just putting up the big psa sign here to say if you are prescribed
antibiotics finish the whole dose even if you feel better you do finish yeah i got yelled at
about that yeah genuinely like that's the oh and you know we talked about like oh what are you
supposed to do about that is the one thing you're supposed to do about it you want sometimes there's
individual action that works yeah i'm on it i'm on it i'm taking my antibiotics my finger feels better i'm
still taking them don't worry good i will hold you to that and i will and i will have to inspect and
make sure that you've actually done it just to save the rest of us yeah and if you happen to be a
general practitioner um consider not prescribing antibiotics unless you need to is the other thing
that too so the cdc decided to send david fraser who is an epidemiologist oh we got a photo of him
on the slide yeah uh so this is your two dads and they're both very disappointed in you um i was about
to say oh yeah this guy's about to tell you why you shouldn't have stolen that car yeah and david
fraser is the guy on the right here um i was gonna say in the glasses but they both have dad glasses
because it was the 70s david fraser is it just is tired of hearing your excuses young man with the
shirt sleeves too yeah i also i find it funny that he used to be a epidemic intelligence service
officer and i'm like hell of a title that's really fucking recruiting human sources inside the bacteria
inside the cop yeah yeah it's like you're gonna go undercover as a bacteria
i will it's like i want to be put on this bacteria suit
so guys how's it going hello fellow bacteria
it's like hey what's up you want to ride the paramecium yeah
yes that sounds fun uh so they the cdc actually got to philly on august 2nd and started putting
together a team and they got there soon enough that there were still cases rolling in so it's
like all right how do we figure out what the hell this is and stop it and initially a flying swine flu
was suspected due to next slide please i i got some like action shots there you go so leonid brezhnev
uh does so uh there was an outbreak of swine flu in january of 1976 at fort dixon new jersey
similar to the 1918 strain oh okay we nearly had spanish flu again yes yeah like spanish flu
two electric boogaloo once again emerging from a u.s military base yeah that's right you can you can
see where the the inspiration for this one italian american flu you can see where the inspiration for
the stand and stuff came from um man that's a that's a book that has not aged well in a lot of ways like
um both in terms of like pandemic response but also man there's some weird stephen king shit in there
yeah there is uh it's one of it's one of my pretty racist pretty racist yeah i'll tell my mom that
hmm oh the open the opening's still fucking terrifying like it's one of the best pieces of like
disease horror i've i've read but like uh yeah after that it gets yeah excuse me sorry
oh no liam has legionella run away oh fuck oh you're gonna enjoy this live show we're all gonna enjoy
it together he's gonna make sure to spit in the cooling tower before
yeah every year we're you know i i'm the sole survivor and i just get taken out by the fact that i have a
like um thorium glass lens on my camera that's been irradiating me you did it to yourself um yeah
that's bad to say that was that was uh that was uh i saw that actually shows up in this this one
hmm we did mass spectrom spectrometry that that's tripped us up before we still don't know how to say
what a spectrometer does oh mass spectrometry it's spectrometry spectrometry it's it's the word that
lets us down rather than the science here so basically what you're doing there is you are
exciting molecules with uh light so you're asking them if they want to ride the paramecium
and it it allows you to separate the chemicals into different like peaks of light and each one
can map to uh like a known compound so you can essentially take feed like a complex science is
so cool just shining a really big flashlight on something and be like what elements are you
yeah and then there's like a piece of paper with a little slit on it and depending where the light
is yeah yeah i've done it before it's fun yeah austria so cdc open up
so what's funny is during the the outbreak of the wine flu like potential pandemic gerald ford freaked out
and was like oh god we have to vaccinate everybody and then you have to like liven up the ford
administration somehow i guess and you know having seen the andromeda strain or read the stand or
whatever he's like oh my god but you know it petered out and everyone got bored and moved on to other
things yeah i mean me whenever i have health anxiety i thought i had rabies for like two weeks and i was
just fine like it's just kind of embarrassing afterwards you're just like i guess there's nothing okay
i mean either you were going to get better or you were going to go crazy and die you know yeah
exactly yeah i strangely i didn't find this very reassuring
i wonder why yeah interesting so what pathogen could this possibly be because could possibly be
causing this and how was it transmitted at least they were able to rule out foodborne
arthropod vector and person to person transmission so arthropod means uh basically
you know ticks mosquitoes things like that um just just sitting a like tick in the uh like police
interrogation chair you know like where we where were you on the night of january uh january 3rd
i'll be right back i'm sorry i have to use the bathroom and turn on my light
it's a podcast that loves to go to the bathroom yeah sure it does i'm sorry i'd love to like flex
that sort of minority of humans that have access to a toilet privilege alice yeah i'm not i'm not over
i thought it man that's yeah fucking ever you never see that in the movies like when they have to go
to the bathroom like when does like neo have to go to the bathroom in the matrix when he's part of
the sixty percent and that's why oh that makes sense yeah maybe he just goes wherever mm just like
in the corner like a like a dog mm-hmm yeah well then i was like i was like maybe they don't poop in
the matrix but that building had a plumbing riser in the first film that they all escaped into so they
must have had a bathroom in there i i mean here's the thing the agents and particularly agent smith
hate having to live in the matrix and like be or resemble humans and when when agents first like
talks about like how the matrix smells and stuff that is the face of a man who was born to kill
and forced to shit yeah oh god i should have just installed better plumbing it's their matrix they
could fix it that's true yeah i guess they figured that the humans my brother in christ you constructed
the matrix well that's why they put the guy in the fucking white suit in the fucking goon cave
to be like um you know anytime somebody gets sick of the matrix to be like uh listen i here's a bunch
of like uh five dollar words about how the matrix is good actually yep yeah he he goes through and
makes sure to delete all the gamers who were just poopsocking it god yeah he's like they smell worst
of all yeah gerald ford was kind of intrigued by this i mean the the context is kind of interesting
in the fact that we humans have been like yeah we've conquered everything this is great we're like
just gonna eliminate all diseases and we have vaccines and stuff it was the 70s we're still building
nuclear power plants like yeah oh yeah but you know it's like and then you know nature goes uh hey you
know you haven't dominated us yet so maybe just get sick and die now cool um clearly we didn't drain as
as many malarial swamps as we needed to clearly not so it seemed like this had to be from air or water but
they tested the water sources and air ducts in and around the hotel and found nothing
so the cdc thus defeated ran home crying to atlanta to continue trying to figure this out
and as we were talking about they uh they called in some friends to join them
uh the franklin institute tested the ac system the academy of natural sciences tested the water supply
the lovely drexel did mass spec on the water uh harvard and mit tested the hair of survivors
looking for environmental toxins and yukon tested for nickel poisoning which was actually a popular
theory because they kept finding nickel in all of the bodies that they examined until they realized that
the autopsy knives were nickel coated and were contaminating the bodies that good yukon research
yeah go huskies
the university of pennsylvania said fuck you we have no civic mindedness
they refused to join the avengers initiative here and we're just like yeah you know city five alice
yeah it's like yeah somebody else will get it the big five and then and then there's the city six
because drexel felt left out of the of basketball
but you know none of these more winning than villanova all time next
so no one in this situation won because no one could figure out the cause but they're like
there's no way this is a bacterium because nothing shows up when we when we culture it on any media
that we try or using gram positive or gram negative is gram indifferent
so most people figured it was like an environment
no gram linihan would be like it's very like subsided on one side
very gram negative yeah so enter dr joseph mcdade a recent we can oh wait i i put in i put in one
more slide before this if we go to the next slide while this was brewing uh i did find a couple things
some people thought this wasn't real or was a government plot to control everyone can you imagine
i i have here in my hand a headline from the national inquirer says top doctors claim climate of fear
created by government legionnaires disease the great hoax this is back before the national
inquirer dropped the kayfabe yeah serious like civic-minded inquiry to be like maybe these people
are just making it up uh if we if we go to the the next slide uh which is in fact a previous slide
if you remember your two dads the guy on the left that's joseph mcdade
the one with the frowny mustache that's joseph mcdade
yes yeah he looks like he has like a shitty cover band that he plays in on weekend you came
home at 11 rumpus room having looking mf um what i'm in the i'm currently podcasting from the formerly
sonically isolated liam room and it works extremely well there was a horrible thunder star on the
knock down like a billion trees a couple days ago i didn't even know it was happening here's the
i know dude you could sleep through anything in that room here's the fucking thing though right
is that corinne fucking doesn't understand how 5.1 surround sound works so she's just like ah
i'm sitting here in this specific spot but all the all five speakers right go right up the stairs
and right into my ear holes and then i have to fucking deal with it while she watches sweet magnolias
or whatever the fuck on netflix get get some like i'm fucking working on it i'm gonna get acoustic
dampening foam or i'm gonna lose my goddamn mind alice yeah try not to station nightclub fire yourself i'm i'm
i'm i'm holding this mic like i'm like i'm a hardcore front man telling you to go vegan
you could also just get a really good headphones i mean i know see here's the thing right is i'm
the one who wanted the 5.1 surround so you played yourself because you wanted to you wanted to get
the canon effects in master and commander you wanted to fucking play your little video games and now
you're getting steel magnolias in like 5.1 uh sweet magnolias it's nuts it's a different thing
steel magnolias i don't even okay yeah so what a quarter in my ass because i played myself
sure okay uh well see scenes from uh you know uh domesticity right yes
so tell me about my disappointed dad yeah your disappointed dad was a researcher in the cdc's
department for rickettsial diseases so rickettsial diseases well rickettsia are a group of bacteria
that cause things like typhus and spotted fevers not rickets though i guess yeah no but they're uh
notoriously different difficult to culture due to being intracellular pathogens which as we talked about
means that they have to live and reproduce inside of another organism's cell hiding inside the cop
yeah exactly yeah so someone suggested to him that this mystery pneumonia could be q fever which is
another one of these rickettsial diseases one of the ones that i really don't like like generally
speaking um there's there's a lot of diseases that i'm really scared of all of the ones that i'm like
factually most scared of and named after the place where the outbreak of it was like you know
first noticed right but like the ones that on paper scare me the most are the ones that are called
q fever or like fucking like ev426 or whatever the fuck and it's like yeah you don't want to get
one of those you know what is a q fever it's it's it's when uh you get a
fuck actually i don't it's when you go on eight chan one too many times and uh
well i was thinking more like it's when a guy beams a mariachi band down onto the
bridge it's like it was a zoonotic thing isn't it it's like fucking um um
oh yeah coxiella brunette oh coxiella brunetti yes yeah yeah that guy
that doesn't help me yeah i the the q stands for query which is some real fucking
bullshit as far as i'm concerned that's fine yeah basically it it's a it's a thing that makes
you real fucking sick and might kill you yeah oh man those are some gnarly x-rays as well
speaking of gnarly x-rays looking at those
so you know mcday didn't think that this could be q fever but you know being a science scientist he
decided to rule it out somebody like ran a like uh herd of sheep through the hotel lobby
right well it turns out the way that one cultures something like this in the 1970s at least uh you
take a sample of blood and or tissue next slide please grind it up into a fine soup-like homogenet
yeah and you inject it into guinea pigs no science it's made the world immeasurably better but
sometimes it involves injecting a sample of blood or tissue into a guinea pig oh and then you kill
the guinea pig and then you take their tissue and grind it up into a soup-like homogenet and then
inject that into embryonated eggs and you're using the guinea pig as a bioreactor for a minute yep i mean
listen listen like i mean granted but i mean the thing about guinea pigs is that aside from being
like god's perfect angels in appearance um they're pretty good for this i mean this is the same as
like you know native america like miso americans eating them it's like they're delicious what do
you want me to do like in much the same way it's like no this is this is a convenient way of like
synthesizing the thing that saves like potentially hundreds of thousands of lives um oh sure
it doesn't don't feel good and there's a lot of like you know animal experimentation that's like
that but um yeah sometimes you gotta fuck an injector thing you know that's my dad yeah
that's my like that's my like i i i wish the the captioner you know a very happy transcribing of
sometimes you gotta fuck an injector thing you know i'm gonna go to twitter ask about this
in like two weeks time sometimes you just gotta inject the thing in the thing
i don't know so forget about it yeah uh yeah
so when mcday did this with lung tissue of people who died of this mystery pneumonia
the guinea pigs got sick i mean the other thing about guinea pigs right is that they are
like vicious little shits who bite you all the time and also get sick and die all the time on
their own they're like absolutely like one constitution ass creature um oh yeah but you know
so it's like all right well the guinea pigs got sick but then when they injected the guinea pig puree
into embryonated eggs uh nothing grew but then he was like hmm what if i like dissect their little
organs so he took stained smears of guinea pig spleen and saw rod-shaped bacteria it's it's so
fucked uh if you go to the next slide i have a picture of those rod-shaped bacteria uh but it's so
fucked that you can be uh smearing guinea pig spleen on a petri dish and being like i'm a good person
and be right yeah i'm solving a medical mystery yeah come on it's like i'm a guinea pig warren
commission let's do this yeah but once once again we get to the the point my favorite point and sort
of like any medical detective thing when we like you know we look upon its face and we're like
fucking i i see you now motherfucker yeah the funny part is is you know it looks just like
like most bacilli it's just a a bitchy one to grow yeah the grains of rice yep basically so despite how
cool this little discovery was and the fact that he'd found the right answer mcdade was like oh well
people are like saying that it's nickel so i'm just gonna not do this for a while but then this would be
the kind of thing that had it happened in the soviet union would be sort of a two episode plot
point in the hbo miniseries we made about it uh 40 years later exactly so well the politics and
the ideology were at work so you know but you know he realized that those people were idiots when it
was like oh wait contaminated autopsy knives uh we're all what yeah just an entire sort of like
medical field putting their head in the house like we are fucking morons just setting a light your
your doctoral degree like never mind i didn't deserve this but of course they won't do that so mcdade
turned out to be right because more than 90 of the philly patients had antibodies to this rod-shaped
bacteria that he was also able to isolate from autopsy specimens why i don't why they couldn't do that
before who knows but hey you got it so were the other the other ten percent the people who died
how does that work or did some people just survive with that not creating anybody's to it maybe i mean
i mean autopsy is uh like you know sometimes you'll pull a sample just so you get lucky you know it
doesn't have the thing in it yeah it's not like a uniform distribution like not every cell in your body
is gonna be like fucking legionella'd up otherwise you would be a hundred percent legionella and be
very gross to look at that'd be pretty ugly a giant bacteria and a trench cod yeah law of averages
you've got a lot of cells yeah i mean the other thing is is that you're so not everybody's body hangs
on to antibodies as well as others so you know if you test them like a year down the line they might not
have any something like that so you know this whole guinea pig homogenate sort of thing was
seems really fun but they were like maybe let's make a culture medium that didn't require all these
expensive guinea pig spleens so you're trying to be pretty cheap
uh i mean the empernated eggs probably aren't though you still gotta yeah and you still gotta you know
you still gotta get all the guinea pigs like they don't just sell you the spleen you got they sell
you the whole oh you got it yeah you got it yeah you're wasting like 90 of that guinea pig whatever
betty hot a reject you can find yeah
so they meant they through trial and error they managed to cobble together something that could
support this picky new bacterium which is i forget what it is it's like it's something something
charcoal something buffered whatever it's an agar that has charcoal it's buffered
something annoying but less annoying than a guinea pig exactly
so the investigation also finally revealed how this was able to happen
yeah i got a picture of the nastiest water in the world oh yeah that's in the cdc museum the bit of
the cdc museum you can just go to and hang out in oh yeah that seems really fun actually
but yeah nastier
same also same oh there are other parts of buildings oh oh sorry ross
so parts that are aerosolized thank god are not water that's aerosolized
yeah i don't like the nastier is this now if this looks nasty but is it as nasty as like i don't
know bilge water for instance bilge water you expect to be like crap like brown and sludgy this
is like piss yellow which is so much more alarming yeah also the jug that they put it in like it's
moonshine this is true yeah i like that though i like the idea i mean hey you know go to the cdc
museum break glass receive free jug you're gonna want to wash it first but like i bet you could
distill it and make bacteria whiskey you make shine out of that yeah it makes you go blind two different
ways ooh exotic mm
all right so basically the bacteria obviously love warm water and the july weather allowed the
bacteria to have a party in the rooftop ac units and then be misted heartily out of the vents in
the lobby and the sidewalk outside the hotel yeah we see uh yeah there's a there's a graph on the
right here which is tracking uh case numbers based on how much time they spent in the lobby um and if
you spent a lot of time in the lobby you were much more likely to get legionnaire's disease
yeah yeah although i was gonna say the moral of this story is don't hang out in the hotel lobby
yeah never do that i mean what's that one fucking fairy convention where the person did the comic
about getting covid going to the thing with covid and then going like getting a plane back home
still with covid rather than quarantining don't do that i mean i i'm not one of those people who's
like we can't ever do any social event ever like i you know because we organize live shows and stuff
and i you know you can get covered from those you know and it sucks but it's like whatever but i do kind
of feel like conventions particularly the kind of conventions where you have like incredible density of
people in like an enclosed environment yeah that's at the very least that's an environment where you
should probably be wearing a mask and not going when you feel sick here's my thing you have a
old-fashioned hotel like this you got a big central air conditioning unit that can spiel legionnaires
out everywhere now hotel rooms all have individual through wall units which presumably won't legionnaires the
whole hotel but if they're not inspected right because you gotta you gotta maintain every single
one of them they might do it to you i don't know if this is better it's the atomization of capitalism
you know it's like you you get legionnaires you're not going to give it to anyone else
yeah you get legionnaires and you die and the hotel is not held liable mm-hmm that's right
yeah i mean honestly that might save not just people in the hotel but also people outside
it because one of the i think most disturbing so so that's sort of the history we're now let's
talk a little bit about you know what's like been happening since then so one of the most disturbing
ones i heard about was a cooling tower in the south bronx of new york in new york in 2015
because not not this is pontiac michigan because pontiac michigan yeah
uh yes which is where the you know mild version originated it turned out because they did went
back and checked antibodies but yeah so south bronx new york uh a single cooling tower caused 138 cases
128 of which were hospitalized and caused 16 deaths and this wasn't even people who were in the building
this was mostly people who just happened to live in the neighborhood and walked by the building
yeah i mean what i shouldn't do like water towers on roofs is one thing i think maybe if you can avoid it
it's probably usually the only place you can put them is the thing
yeah is the uh is the cooling tower um you know you can have i mean like university of pennsylvania has a huge
centralized chilling plant that's in the middle of nowhere comparatively so no one's walking by that
i've walked by it how you can just walk by it dude there's a path
is there yeah we'll take a walk next time yeah we try not to try not to get legionnaires um
you can do it dude i'll show you how to do it nice uh yeah urbex sort of like expedition for um
for you and the fans um yeah fuck what was i gonna say um yeah this is like the one of the only kinds
of like epidemiology left um that isn't like you know the kind of stuff we have to wear 15 layers of
like plastic and rubber to work where 22 cases one die fuck me where where you can still do um the kind
of like fun mapping stuff that it used to be like with cholera back in the day you know um actually
wait that yeah that's a coincidence that stuck with me um this was like originally called the like
broad street uh like broad street flu or something like this uh because the hotel is on broad street
uh are we are we aware of the name of the street where the like water pump uh in in london uh
in like 1854 was that sort of like pioneered this kind of uh experimentation was also broad street
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so that's a fun story which we'll get you back on to do if you like
um sure but yeah that's a that's a fun little coincidence too the hot tubs are freaking me out
never never live on broad street no wherever whichever broad street yeah
yeah so yeah the uh the hot tub one is fun uh let's see hot like here's some examples hot tub at
a lowe's home improvement in virginia in october 1996 caused 15 people to be hospitalized and one died
uh a fairly local case for here uh hot tub at sands resort in hampton beach new hampshire in 2018
uh 49 cases and two people died and there are still a bunch of lawsuits not going with that one
don't get in the hot tub yeah and then and even the end the best for last for the hot tubs the
north carolina mountain state fair september 2019 just walking by a hot tub display in like your
dumb old state fair why was there a hot tub display you gotta come to more fairs al yeah you gotta come to
more fairs there's the air like visibly like misted with bacteria it's weird it's weird yep yeah yeah
yep 136 cases 98 hospitalized and four dead i mean shit if you don't get something from the water in
that kind of environment you're gonna get something from the people in the hot tubs like oh yeah you're
gonna get like gastroenteritis so and the fun part is is the the the the hot tubs aren't there for you to
get in they're really just there to like entice you into buying one but like like here's the concept
of a hot tub we're running 50 of them at once and spraying you all down with like hot water vapor yes
yep you're supposed to keep them chlorinated
yeah but that costs money and time
yeah they're doing that at the fair ross i can tell you that right so so so do lawsuits yeah it
turns out
if only state fair people were perfectly rational yeah well that's true imagine a perfectly spherical
state fair especially north north carolina north carolina mountain state fair oh yeah
at tidewater north carolina yeah yeah no but yeah the one that really gets me too is decorative fountains
so the the funniest one is a decorative fountain in a hospital lobby in wisconsin
in 2010 caused eight confirmed cases i mean nobody died because they were in the
fucking hospital but it's like maybe don't put a decorative fountain in your hospital lobby
unless you're gonna actually take care of it
yeah i mean people complain about the art in and around british hospitals um there's there's one in
london that's literally just like a stone that we just dumped outside like a big brazilian stone
that everyone complains about because we spent like 70 000 quid on it but yeah i tell you what
at least it doesn't give you legionnaire's disease
no it's gonna turn out to give you like uh that game of thrones disease that turns you into a rock
it's gonna petrify you yeah
yeah
that's pretty fun and then the last fountain uh example that i found that was real fun is a
fountain in a hotel lobby in chicago in august 2012 caused 114 infections 15 hospitalized and three dead
do not go in the hotel lobby do not go in the hotel do not go in the decorative fountain in the
hotel lobby yeah yeah or just anywhere near it you know yeah
so yeah um capitalism not doing basic maintenance to save money uh killing you in new and exciting ways
hmm and as as you said at the beginning climate change means all the water and the fun little
water features is gonna get hotter um which means that it's you know um our our beloved legionella
bacteria are gonna like it way more
yeah i don't
that one again i credit all credit to my partner i was like wait i don't get it why is it like
danny devito's penguin but like not in full costume and it's like i don't know it it's funny
you know what it is it is funny i was like you know what i don't care that it has nothing to do with
it i really deeply enjoy this what have we dare i ask learned don't go anywhere
yeah especially don't go to a hospital and don't go to the county fair or the state fair or the
york fair and don't prance around in the hot tub displays trying to try to balance my fear of
legionnaire's disease with developing a fear of water which would then cause me to worry that i have
rabies again yeah you should probably adequately treat the water in the cooling tower and prevent it
as well from cycling through into the uh actual airstream of the air conditioner you know that
this is sort of what i'm seeing here sort of like that's part of it yeah just fucking blast
everything with chlorine like it's the battle of passchendaele yeah well not necessarily chlorine
you can do it you can do a bunch of shit you can do ozone you can uh stick my old camera lens over
it and like lightly irradiate it if you want like mm-hmm yep yeah that's what actually we need in the
center of every cooling tower is a cobalt 90 source i i really hope to god i do not have a cobalt glass
camera lens and then there's just a a new like spate of orphan source problems when companies go
well this is not useful anymore and just chuck it in the dumpster yeah don't don't get in the hot tub
that's the main thing i'm learning yeah yeah i like do do not approach a wild hot tub or a hot tub
that you don't already know and know and know its owner yeah i mean that's a lot of like did we have
we've had for thousands of years ways of making communal bathing as safe as we can make it you know
um and this is one of those things that's like it's like wild swimming or whatever where it's like
no we've you know ruined it for all of us we can't be trusted with it sorry yes
also screw decorative fountains break them all
yeah do like a sort of like denny villeneuve kind of like dune kind of like rock feature thing um
again you can just cycle out the water every once in a while like you're supposed to
it's an indoor water feature that's basically free to do um yeah that's work you have to have a guy
it's like one more thing to do you know it's like when it's like when you remember when uh
whatchamacallit just stop oil or whoever yeah down to the trevi fountain and they put some charcoal in it
and everyone's like oh my god they destroyed the fountain it was like no they just have to cycle
out the water yeah and uh you know i looked at how much that cost and it was like less than six
hundred dollars at roman water prices um it's just a solvable problem guys you know at some point
just up oil is presumably gonna do something that i don't like but it's yet to happen like
no most of the stuff they've done is pretty funny yeah so so so far 100 hit rate every time i've been
like yeah nice get after it hell yeah so anyway cycle out the water in your fountain because it's
cheap and stops you from getting a horrible disease mm-hmm chlorinate your hot tub aggressively like
passion dale yes for the love of god yeah mm-hmm if you if you have a water tower on top of your
building you should don't die in it like that one girl i don't actually know jesus yeah absolutely
don't like die stay on your meds so you don't climb into your own water tower and die and then make
everyone in the building drink your decomposing body for like the next six months absolutely don't do that
that's actually an interesting one about the new york city water towers is they are protected by the
bacteria in them rather than uh um at that causing legionnaires disease because there's a natural coating
that forms on the inside of the wood um all of the microbes trying to get through the door at once
yeah exactly all right all right uh emily thanks so much for coming on um if if the people want more
emily where where can they find you should they want to well i am on x uh
uh yeah it's such a uh god i i'm just waiting for it all to crash and burn i barely post on there
though so i don't know um other than that i need a blue sky invite heavily talk about your beer podcast
that we've both been on yeah and i and i so i have two other podcasts i have a beer podcast called new
england beer reviews that is been really inconsistent lately but eh whatever we mostly go on and just
chit chat and talk about beers we've had and drink beer while while doing it and so that's fun and then
i am also on a movie podcast called see it or screw it that liam was on for a while and uh just just sort
of you know hasn't been on for ages made it into nothingness yep we miss you come back sometime uh
but yeah that one that one's real fun so oh yeah go check those out
all right well uh real quick before we wrap up everybody say their favorite microbe
no that's scary let me let me get anthrax oh yeah okay i wanted anthrax god damn it
i have a tiny little tiny little plush anthrax on my shelf yeah wait there's a i have a plush
anthrax oh someone's got all three of us anthrax a little hard hat that's like a while back
aww uh my favorite microbe is listeria because it does a if you put it on a microscope slide it has a
tumbling motility so it's like these little squiggle guys that are just kind of like tumbling around
that's fine uh oh i i think i might like go back to uh no because since you mentioned beer podcast
no the yeast there you go yes love a yeast yeah all right bye everybody bye yeah bye everyone write
in your favorite microbe in the comments yeah
