And now, Chesterfield Cigarettes and Sullivan and Cromwell Attorneys at Law present The Fourth Reich on the March.
That's right, the eggheads at the Pentagon have added up the facts and figures, and they summed up round as a shiny new dime.
So Top Brass has sent down the command. The 2,000-year Reich of Western Christendom will end as it began, in Jerusalem.
Yes, our boys are headed to Asia Minor, fit, fed, and ready to show Johnny Muslim what's what.
G.I. Joe doesn't mind a bumpy ride because he knows he'll soon be dancing the Watusi on a pile of charcoal Saracens.
But you mustn't imagine our gallant Yankee Doodles overworked like subhuman Ruskies in a red communist gulag.
In the Near East, America's business is its pleasure, and vice versa.
They say the only thing hotter than white phosphorus is the nightlife in Tel Aviv.
And if the power's still out in Gaza, every hardy young jack can steal a longing glance of his buxom Jill one romantic airstrike at a time.
Yes, our fighting boys have plenty to keep them busy, from stomping Arab toddlers to painting Kilroy was here on the Dome of the Rock.
But keep the home fires burning, ladies, because these world champions will be covered in glory and safely back stateside
before you hear Santa's reindeer clip-clap-clopping on the roof.
That's the Fourth Reich on the March.
The Fourth Reich on the March.
Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well, as Alex Delarge would say.
Oh, my brothers and only friends, I, your humble narrator,
speaking to every celovec in Diovochka out there in radio land.
What has it been?
Two weeks, two weeks it's been, and not, not a sliver, not a dazzle, not a lost shard of sunlight.
Dark upon dark, night plus night, multiplied by night, exponentiated to the power of night.
And what did I spy just the night before recording this but another literal rave next to a concentration camp.
It happened again.
And this time it was IDF people doing it.
To say nothing of the possible presence of IDF people at the first one.
And so I have been, as you might imagine, fretting away the hours thinking,
on the one hand, I cannot talk about anything else but this.
It would feel insane to talk about anything else but this.
But on the other, what is it exactly that I can say?
What is it that can convey the horror of what is going on?
More than just opening my laptop every morning and immediately seeing pictures of toddlers with half their skulls blown away.
Seeing amputated limbs sticking out from under the rubble.
What is it that I am supposed to say when the Al Jazeera journalist, I believe his name is Wael al-Dakhdouk,
has his entire family killed simply because he is reporting on what is going on in Gaza.
And when amidst the usual Israeli practice of a stream of contradictory denials before finally a kind of smug admission that,
yeah, actually they did do it.
Someone gets on TV in Israel and says, oh yeah, we know where the bombs and rockets are going.
They're all targeted.
We don't make many mistakes.
That journalist, for instance, we knew what we were doing.
What can I say to measure up to any of that?
What can I sort of, you know, outside the AV area, as someone once put it,
looking over the fence to where the IDF is getting down to fucking clown step next to a genocide?
What is it that I can add to any of that?
And perforce, it seems to me that maybe the most useful thing I can say now is,
after having on the previous episode, to try to give you some sense,
having tried, rather, to give you some sense of just exactly what Gaza is,
and just exactly what a genocide is, so that there can be no mistaking that this is, in fact, a genocide.
Now, I pray to God it is not a fully successful genocide.
I pray to God it doesn't become a fully successful extermination.
But it's a genocide one way or the other.
It doesn't really matter the extent at this point.
In terms of its categorization as a genocide, it's that no matter what else happens.
And it seems to me that if I can say anything useful,
it is to take the opposite tack of the one I took before.
Because I frankly feel pretty fucking exhausted in trying to get across what is happening in Gaza.
And I suspect that most of the listeners of this show have been paying their own amount of attention to that kind of thing,
have seen the photos, have heard the fucking sound of that J-Dam hitting Al-Akhli Baptist Hospital,
has been ringing in my ears.
I think I've mentioned on the show before that I have terrible nightmares.
I have a nightmare essentially every time I go to sleep.
And every night now, every night I'm seeing dead children every time I close my eyes.
It doesn't stop.
I don't think it's going to stop.
I don't know if the end of this will make it stop.
Because there is an excellent chance that the end of this will be much, much, much worse than it is right now.
So, given that I have done what little I can do to try to put Gaza across to you,
and to convey the scale of the crime that we are witnessing right now,
and some of you, it shocks me to think,
some of you may be young enough that you don't really remember September 11th,
and some of you, Jesus God, some of you may not have been born on September 11th.
But I was there, I remember it very, very well.
And to me, anyway, by my reckoning, this is a lot worse than that.
Because September 11th, at least to both a 14-year-old and myself,
and to the adults around me who it turned out, I would later discover,
had the brains of 14-year-olds,
September 11th had an air of the surreal about it, right?
It was destabilizing to one's sense of reality.
And that destabilization almost softened the blow in a way.
It seemed like an accident in the fabric of the world.
You know, not that the attacks were accidental, absolutely not.
The CIA did a really good job planning them for years.
But that it was somehow a glitch in the system that this had been allowed to happen at all.
It seemed too weird and too massive,
and particularly as a public attack on public iconography,
to be almost too on the nose.
You know what I mean?
The same way that in a psychotic break, let me tell you,
in a psychotic break, people will often depersonalize and derealize
because the agony of being in their own collapsing brains is too much to take.
And so you simply start seeing yourself as from the outside.
You start feeling like,
I remember a doctor asking me to explain this once,
and the best way I could put it across was,
imagine that you are watching yourself,
or something that is supposedly yourself,
and it's talking and moving around and doing things,
but you don't feel in control of it.
You feel like you are watching it on a surveillance camera,
that you're in a blackout bunker somewhere,
and you are watching this alien entity that is supposed to be you
going about the motions of its life,
or, in fact, doing something fucking insane.
That is kind of how September 11th felt.
The derealization of it,
I think, on a number of levels,
including anyone wanting to know what really happened,
it took us out of that a bit, right?
It was a bit of cladding, a bit of shielding.
Whereas this, this horror, this genocide,
I'll say it over and over,
in Gaza,
is worse to me,
because it is precisely the opposite of that.
There is nothing freakish.
There is nothing, you know,
prodigious in the old sense of the term.
These are no signs and wonders.
This is nothing mysterious.
What we are looking at right here is the core of reality,
is the bare bone, bottom level,
fucking basement of Tartaros level of reality.
It is what everything else is built upon.
And it has been reminding me,
in that way,
of a guy I've talked about on this show before,
and would like to talk about more,
but he's very difficult to talk about,
Roberto Bolaño,
the Chilean novelist,
and especially his book 2666.
And as some of you may know out there,
2666,
it kind of revolves around
a semi-fictionalized version
of what have been called the Feminecidas
in Ciudad Juarez,
in Mexico,
right across the border from El Paso.
Feminecidas,
that is murders of women.
And in most cases,
rapes and murders of women.
And the official Mexican state toll on these,
they claim,
I think,
something between,
you know,
a few hundred and a thousand women
may have been murdered
in and around Juarez
since the early and mid-90s,
which is fucking preposterous.
The activist groups
who have been trying to call attention
to this shit
for 30 years now,
I have seen a number of estimates,
but most of them
put the death toll
between 50,000
and 100,000 women
horrifically slaughtered.
And
what Bolaño does
incredibly well in that book,
the thing that I,
I think,
prevents that book
from being,
you know,
just horror voyeurism,
just sort of,
you know,
atrocity tourism,
is that
he presents
the Feminecidas
not at all
as some
otherworldly
horrifying phenomenon
that,
you know,
just slipped through
a breach
in the fabric of reality
and it's inexplicable
and it's
incomprehensible
and no one can really
know anything about it
so no one can do
anything about it.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
The position
of that book,
which I think
is absolutely correct,
is that
these
unspeakable
crimes against
women in Juarez
are not an exception
to the way things work,
are not a fracture
in reality.
They are the very
core
of reality
because a place
like Juarez
is where
all the waste,
all the horror,
all the violence,
all the blood
that keeps the rest
of the western world
running,
that's where it all
comes out of an
escape valve,
right?
Mexico in general
has been a pretty
good case of this
over the last 30 years,
but I think
the Juarez
killings
really put a point
on it
that nothing
about this
is really
inexplicable
or even particularly
hard to understand.
It is simply
that
a world
order that runs
on blood,
a world
Moloch
cult
in which
you have
to feed
human sacrifices
to the
death god,
it has to have
a place
to spew out
all those bodies,
right?
And in the
90s,
Ciudad Juarez
became an
excellent place
to use
as the fucking
dumping ground
for all
the unburied
corpses
of western
capitalism
because
the time
these murders,
as far as
anyone knows,
started
was of course
exactly the
same time
that
NAFTA
was passed
and the
same time
that our
friends at
the DEA
and CIA
really threw
their weight
behind the
Sinaloa cartel
as our
chosen boys
down south,
that we would
allow them
to operate
with impunity,
in fact,
would even
arm them
in exchange
for,
allegedly,
information
on other
drug cartels,
but you know
what that means.
That means
in exchange
for a cut
of the profits,
that means
rights to
distribute
within the
United States.
It's everything
you suspect
it to be.
And suddenly
you have
this country,
Mexico in the
90s,
where because
of the
sycophancy
of the
right-wing
Mexican government
toward the
United States.
And because
of these
new labor
laws allowing
essentially
American
businesses
to operate
facilities
in Mexico,
getting away
from all
the American
tax law,
but not
being forced
to follow
American labor
law either.
So they
could have
these gigantic,
I mean,
they're really,
they're fucking
the houses
of Gog and
Magog.
They call
them the
maquis or
the maquiladoras
along the
border.
So there
is this
inrush
of people
who desperately
need jobs
and money
to these
border towns
where the
gigantic factories
employ so
many people
that there's
almost always
a job there.
And also
the people
who work
there are
consistently
getting killed.
if you try
to organize
a labor
union
at one
of the
maquiladoras,
that is
your ass.
You are
gone real
quick.
And the
complete
collapse
of any
sort of
real,
effective
civic
institution
means that
the cartels
and let's
not make
this a
Mexico
land of
fear
problem.
No,
no,
no.
The cartels
with our
explicit
support and
cooperation
come to
substitute
for what
used to
be state
level
institutions
and
people
who are
living
outside,
let's say,
the direct
employment or
involvement of
the cartels.
I don't know
if anyone
in northern
Mexico is
untouched
by them.
I would
say no.
But
those people,
even knowing
the horrifying
amount of
violence in
a place like
Juarez,
even knowing
the sweatshop
conditions
at the
American
factories,
even knowing
if they
ever try to
agitate for
any kind
of rights,
they're going
to be
murdered.
And even
knowing that
if they
never try to
agitate for
any kind
of rights,
if they're
simply there
and they're
women,
there is an
excellent chance
that they're
going to be
kidnapped,
raped,
and murdered.
Still,
those people
keep flowing
up from
other parts
of northern
Mexico,
and even
central and
southern,
because civic
institutions have
collapsed to
such a degree
that the
only way to
make sure you're
going to have
enough money to
eat, and
barely enough
money for that,
is to rent
yourself out to
one of these
massive American
corporations that's
always hiring.
And in order to
do that,
you really have
no choice but
to accept
whatever cartel
is, you know,
most powerful
in that region
as your new
civic institution,
effectively as
your new
government.
And of course,
government people
secretly working
for the cartels,
police working
for the cartels,
I mean,
fucking,
the Zetas
cartel,
was
originally composed
of a group
of guys,
they were sort
of something
like Mexican
special forces
called the
GAFE,
I believe it's
Grupo Aero
Mobile de
Fuerzas
Especiales,
who got
training in
the U.S.
at Fort
Bragg,
because of
course they
did.
And then
realized that
in terms of
money,
that training
would be put
to much
better use
starting a
drug cartel
than just
being working
stiffs in the
fucking Mexican
military.
The cartel
power has so
saturated
everything else
there,
there is really
no meaningful
distinction to
make between
politics and
drugs,
or policing
and drugs,
or the
military and
drugs.
I mean,
some places
in the north,
the cartels
openly put
forth candidates
for political
office.
The days of
Sinaloa are
somewhat past,
which is why
incidentally,
El Chapo is
in a fucking
glass box,
not being
allowed to
testify at
his own
trial,
because other
than Osama
Bin Laden,
I don't think
there is anyone
America less
wants to give
a microphone
to.
So Sinaloa
wanes,
Chapo can
safely be
arrested,
and then
there's the
most horrifying
period of the
drug war.
in the
2012 region,
where,
you know,
in the
U.S.,
if a major
city has
300 murders,
that's
considered a
crisis.
Well,
Juarez,
in I believe
2012,
which is a
small city
by American
standards,
Juarez is
about,
I think,
300,000 or
400,000 actual
registered
residents,
and then
millions of
unknown people
living in
these
unimaginable
slums
outside the
city,
between the
city proper
and the
Sierra Juarez
mountains,
that city,
even if you
could somehow
count all the
people who
aren't officially
there,
of whom there
is no
documentation
living there,
they had
3,000
murders
that year,
10 times as
many as
would make
an American
city lose
its shit,
not least
because the
military strategy
at that time,
the political
strategy at that
time,
was essentially
to let the
military occupy
cities and
engage in
open war with
anyone they
considered a
narco,
the problem
here being,
of course,
that the
members of
the military
were also
narcos,
the police
were also
narcos,
there is
no way
past that
institutional
saturation,
and what
Bolaño does
in 2666
is to take
this phenomenon
and say,
there is
nothing
freakish
about this,
there is
nothing
beyond
comprehension,
there is
nothing even
particularly
mysterious,
because the
maintenance
of western
capitalism
requires this
kind of
place,
it runs
on corpses,
it always
has,
it always
will,
and for
a variety
of reasons,
from NAFTA
to institutional
support for
the cartels,
Ciudad Juarez
became the
dumping ground
for all of
the mangled
meat,
all of the
unnamed
corpses,
all of the
unfathomable
wash of
blood,
the incredible
fucking
elephant graveyard
that western
capitalism
necessitates,
that was
just the
escape valve,
that was
where we
put it,
so we
wouldn't
have to
look at
it elsewhere,
so that it
wouldn't crop
up in our
cities,
so that when
we turned on
the faucets,
blood wouldn't
run out of
them,
so that when
we tried to
dig a basement
for a
shitty fucking
suburban
McMansion,
and a whole
set of
tract
McMansions,
identical as
far as the
eye can see,
we wouldn't
actually dig
up skeletons,
because we
would be at
real risk of
that if we
domesticated that
part of the
gross national
product,
right?
And it
hit me that
this is perhaps
the best way
for someone like
me, who is,
however much I
wish it were not
true, a citizen
of the Fourth
Reich, a
Reichsburger,
to speak to you
who are,
through no fault
of your own,
almost all
citizens of
the Fourth
Reich.
It's not your
fault, you
didn't do
anything wrong,
but you
better know
where the
fuck you
are right
now.
You better
understand
exactly what
your world
is based on,
and this,
I think,
is, from
our side of
it, maybe
the most
crucial insight
you can have
about what's
going on in
Gaza right
now.
This is not
some
unpredictable
disaster.
This is
certainly not
some, you
know, biblical
bullshit about
the clash of
civilizations, the
ancient in-between
between peoples.
Fuck that.
No, that doesn't
explain anything.
What is going
on in Gaza is
what has gone
on all over
the goddamn
world at our
behest for
decades and
decades, and if
you want to
extend, you
know, the
capitalist
enterprise past
the contemporary
United States,
has gone on
all over the
world for
centuries upon
centuries upon
centuries.
I don't know
how any
person who
grew up in
a country with
a 250-year
history of
enslaving
Africans can
be surprised by
the level of
violence that is
occurring in
Gaza right now.
This is not
unusual.
What is
unusual is
that you
are being
forced to
look at it.
This is an
intentional outcome
of an imperial
strategy.
This is the
kind of thing
they know has
to happen
every so often,
well, really
constantly, just
not always on
this scale, for
the people in
power to
maintain their
power, for
the people who
are rich to
stay rich.
it's not
particularly
mysterious.
They understand
it very, very
well indeed.
But you and
I don't
normally have
it shoved in
our faces.
I mean, I do
because that's
my job, but
when I say you
and I, I mean
the American
population at
large.
So I tried
to think of
what I would
say to people
on our side
during this.
And when I
say our
side, I
don't mean
solidarity with
Palestinians or
support for
Israel.
I don't mean
individual politics.
What I mean is
simply our
side in the
political economy
of how a
genocide like
Gaza happens.
And we are
seeing a
number of
things in
real time
right now that
some of us
may never have
had the
opportunity to
see before.
We are seeing
the gears and
levers of the
Fourth Reich
exposed to a
degree that is
I think
unprecedented in
my lifetime.
And we need
to look down
into that
machinery.
We need to
look all the
way down the
fucking poisoned
wells full of
bones.
And while we
have this
chance,
understand how
this works,
why it happens,
and that
triple underline,
it is not
the exception.
I've talked
before about
the horrific
Nazi jurist
Carl Schmitt,
whose work was
later taken up
by Giorgio
Agamben,
the Italian
philosopher,
and the
concept of
the state of
exception.
That sovereign
is he who
decides the
state of
exception.
Sovereign is
he or it
which decides
when the laws
apply and
when they
don't.
Who is a
citizen and
who isn't?
Who is a
human being and
who isn't?
What's murder
and what's war?
And of course
that still
obtains,
disgustingly
enough to say,
what, 90
years after
Schmitt wrote
it, maybe?
but in the
sense of
exception
as in
a matter
of
the unusual
as in
a matter
of the
outside
the program,
this is not
exceptional
at all.
This is the
core.
You are just
getting a look
at what
really powers
the world.
You are
seeing them
make the
batteries out
of dead
children.
You are
seeing them
crush
buildings
full of
hundreds of
people,
murder
entire
families,
generation
upon
generation
in a
single
instant.
And all
of that
by the
evil
alchemical
properties
of the
dollar,
that eventually
translates back
into oil,
that translates
back into
weapons,
that translates
back into
continual
quarterly
growth for
the
shareholders,
which if
our
civilization
is actually
based upon
anything,
if it has
any actual
core imperative,
that would be
it.
You can't
just make
a profit.
Every quarter
you have to
make more
profit than
you've ever
made before.
And with
that sort of
mandate in
place,
there is
absolutely
nothing we
won't do.
there is
no act
beyond our
capability.
And this
brings me to
one of the
first pieces
of, I
wouldn't call
it advice
exactly,
just things
to watch
from the
Fourth Reich
during this,
right?
Number one,
notice how
you are
watching
genocide
denial
in real
time.
And there
are the
obvious
examples of
this,
right?
Israel
lying and
lying and
lying and
lying and
lying about
virtually
everything.
Israel
piling five
contradictory
lies on
top of
each other
to exculpate
themselves from
something everyone
knows Israel
did.
I'm sorry,
if you saw
the video
of Al-Akhni,
the hospital,
getting blown
up,
if you think
that was a
fragment from
a Hamas
rocket,
I can't
help you,
man.
it might be
time to
just hang
him up and
go to a
nursing home.
Because if
you've ever
seen a
Hamas
rocket in
your life,
you know
there is
not one
billionth of
a chance
that that
could have
been a
fragment of
a rocket
or a
fragment of
a Palestinian
Islamic
jihad
rocket,
not even
sort of
vaguely
kind of
plausible,
complete
bullshit,
or the
kind of
denial,
that really
earned Joe
Biden the
nickname
Genocide Joe
these last
couple weeks,
claiming that
he doesn't
believe the
death figures
out of
Palestine
because,
come on,
man,
that's a
mess,
man.
I got
no notion
that they're
giving me
the accurate
numbers.
I don't
know nothing
about the
numbers,
man.
I got
who knows
how many
people died,
which would
be a criminal
thing to
say after
this is all
over,
but to
say during
it,
and not
while it is
winding down,
but while it
is winding
up to
what may
still be a
full-scale
Israeli ground
invasion of
Gaza,
and perhaps
a broader
regional war
because,
as some of
you may
have heard,
America is
in up to
its fucking
hips now.
The reports
about what
exactly America
is doing right
now are
scattershot,
but we know
pretty much for
certain that
the USA has
now sent
one gigantic
fucking
nuclear-powered
aircraft carrier,
the USS
Dwight D.
Eisenhower,
which,
you know,
if you're a
bit of a
history fan,
has a
certain ring
to it,
Iran,
Guatemala,
on and
on and
on,
and the
retinue of
cruiser and
destroyer ships
that goes
with the
USS Eisenhower,
and two
separate
missile systems,
pardon me,
one called
a THAAD
that is a
ballistic
missile defense
system,
which allegedly
shoots down
incoming rockets,
although it
is my
understanding
from people
who know a
lot more
about the
military and
war than I
do,
that there's
really almost
no proof that
missile defense
systems actually
work,
and that they
are really the
greatest grift
going in terms
of first world
arms sales
elsewhere.
who knows
whether it
actually fucking
does anything,
who knows
whether it
was actually
intended to
do anything,
but it's
there,
and a
Patriot missile
system,
a surface-to-air
offensive missile,
and at least
2,000 Marines,
and I think we
all know
historically that
when the U.S.
sends a bunch
of missiles,
an aircraft
carrier,
destroyer ships,
and 2,000 Marines
into a foreign
country,
it usually
stops there.
It doesn't go
any further
than that.
It's just a
protective measure.
We're taking
all the necessary
precautions,
and by God,
we sure hope
this doesn't
escalate.
And again,
as I say,
reports about
this are sketchy,
but I believe
it was a
Haaretz reporter
who said that
these missile
systems are
being brought
not just for
the direct
Israel-Gaza
thing,
Israel-Pasar
Palestine thing,
because of
course Israel
has the
Iron Dome
missile defense
system,
which apparently
also doesn't
work very well,
that the U.S.
is looking to
station some
of this missile
shit in
Jordan and
perhaps even
Iraq.
And the fact
that we would
be stationing
ballistic defense
and surface-to-air
missiles in
Jordan and
Iraq,
or even
thinking about
that,
tells me that
the American
government and
American military
are quite
prepared for
this to boil
over into a
gigantic regional
war,
and perhaps
are even
hoping that it
will.
Because I have
no doubt that
the government of
Israel right now
would love to
march to
fucking Beirut
like it's
1982,
and the
involvement of
Lebanon,
of course,
allows us to
bring out our
famous old
line that
Hamas and
Hezbollah and
whoever else are
just proxies of
Iran, and that
it's the Iranians
we really have to
deal with,
and people like
Michael Flynn
can jump back in
there.
People like John
Bolton.
Remember how
liberals love
John Bolton
now?
Remember fucking
Brad Pitt getting
up at the
Golden Globes or
whatever that
bullshit was and
saying,
I'm only being
given 45 minutes
to speak,
which is more
than John Bolton
got, and the
crowd cheering?
Well, those
people are going
to be back,
and they are
going to be
whispering in
the ears of
either a
senile rapist
moron in
Joe Biden,
or a
clique of
shameless
murderers,
a clique of
genocidaire who
no longer even
care enough to
pretend they're
not doing it,
people like
Blinken, who
is just a
remarkable
moron,
people like
Jake Sullivan,
people like
Samantha Power,
Michelle
Flourneuil,
all the Obama
liberal
interventionist
assholes,
and hey,
now that the
Trump years
made peace
between the
Obama people,
and the
neocons,
maybe the
whole gang
will be
back,
right?
You are
watching a
genocide that
may boil
over into
a gigantic
war, and I
think for
some people
it would be
ideal if it
did, because
the gigantic
war would
make Gaza
simply one
front in a
multi-front
war to
protect
democracy in
the Middle
East, and
Israel's
right to
defend
itself, and
we must
always be
willing to
come to
the aid of
our regional
allies, all
that bullshit.
But when I
talk about
genocide denial
in real time,
I'm not just
talking about
it in the
literal sense,
I'm talking
about it in
what you might
loosely call
the PSYOP,
or psychological
warfare sense,
because I
think there
is something
about this
genocide, I'm
not going to
call it a
war, right?
I think it
was Bill
Hicks who
said, I
was under
the impression
that a war
is when two
armies fight.
This isn't
that.
This is one
lavishly funded
military committing
a genocide in
an open air
concentration camp,
so I'm not
going to say
war.
But I
think this
genocide, because
of the mass
of real on
the ground
evidence,
presents sort
of an
epistemological
problem to
the Western
observer, a
problem of
credulity and
of reality,
this question
of derealization
we were talking
about earlier,
in that we
don't feel to
some degree
that if we
can see these
things, they
could possibly
be real,
right?
We know on
some level,
anyone who's
looked into
anything at
all in his
or her entire
life, essentially,
that, yeah, this
is how the world
runs.
Of course this
is how the
world runs.
We do this
all the time,
but we don't
have to watch
it.
And being
made to
watch it,
I think,
for, you
know, some
constituency in
the United
States,
majority,
minority, I
have no
idea, is
horrifying them
into a
serious moral
realization,
into serious
opposition.
But I think
for another
sort of U.S.
constituency,
and importantly,
electorate,
next year,
the very fact
that we are
able to see
these things
in a paradoxical
way discredits
them.
Because this
is the stuff
we don't
see.
This is the
stuff that we
all have
guilty fucking
consciences about,
knowing that it
is what undergirds
our entire
system, knowing
that this is
always happening
to someone
somewhere,
by being
done, if not
directly by us,
then by our
proxies, by
militaries we
arm, by
private military
contractors, and
the ability
to see it
therefore makes
it suspect to
people.
That, you know,
well, if Israel
were really doing
this, wouldn't
they do everything
they could to
hide it?
You know, if
this was real,
if Israel really
shot a fucking
JDAM at a
hospital and
killed 500
people, who
knows how many
fucking children
and patients and
refugees and
doctors, well,
surely they
wouldn't be so
lax as to
allow that to
slip through
the cracks,
right?
I mean, if
Israel were
targeting and
murdering the
entire extended
families of
journalists and
doctors, we
wouldn't know
about it, would
we?
I mean, the
Israeli army is
so good.
They're so good
at what they
do.
They're like the
second or third
best military in
the world.
I just can't
imagine that
they're, and
you know how
people love
these bullshit
words, this
hideous
terminology of,
I guess I
would call it
something I
can't say on
air, open
source idiocy,
that, you
know, they're
OPSEC, they're
InfoSEC.
It wouldn't be
this lax, it
wouldn't be this
lagging.
So, if I can
see Al-Akhli
being blown
up, that must
mean Israel
didn't do it,
right?
That must
mean this is
a Palestinian
smear campaign.
Hamas trying
to frame
Israel.
A Palestinian
Islamic
Jihad trying
to flame,
flame, well,
I guess in the
online sense,
yeah, sure,
trying to frame
Israel.
Because,
obviously, this
military superpower
to which we give
right around
three billion
dollars every
year in just
regular, normal
budgetary spending
to say nothing
of the massive
amounts of money
that pour in
every time they
incite a war,
they wouldn't do
it like that,
would they?
They would get
away with it.
It would be
slick, it would
be smooth.
We would never
have to watch
it.
And I think
this is partly
to do with
the generations
of Americans
that are here
now watching
this.
That we've got,
you know,
obviously there's
some people older
than baby boomers
left.
But,
primarily,
we've got
boomers,
Generation X,
millennials,
and zoomers,
right?
And these are
people who,
even if they
were, you
know,
relatively young
at the time,
even if they
were actual
children at the
time,
they have grown
up in the
age of the
global war
on terror.
And the
global war on
terror,
as much as
any actual
exercise in
violence over
there,
of course,
that's the
most important
part.
But over
here,
it was a
superb exercise
in never
letting anyone
see what
you're doing.
And if
anyone does
see what
you're doing,
say,
like,
Chelsea Manning,
say,
the information
spread by
people like
Assange,
you ruin
their fucking
lives.
You absolutely
destroy them.
and because
the press
is full of
bootlicking
little shitheels,
the fact that
you have
destroyed them
retroactively
makes them
less credible,
right?
You and I,
if you're an
adult now,
and you're,
I don't know,
say,
40 or younger,
you have lived
your entire
life,
essentially,
in a state
of ongoing
war.
But after
the initial
incursions
into Afghanistan
and Iraq,
you didn't
have to think
about that
much.
You just
knew,
oh,
it's this
kind of
messy
fucking
slog,
you know,
a quagmire,
as Rumsfeld
liked to say,
and there's
hardly anything
we can do
about it.
You know,
I just
remember today
fucking
Antony Blinken
and Joe
Biden's
brilliant plan
to divide
Iraq
into
Sunnistan,
Shia-stan,
and Kurdistan.
Can you
believe that
the motherfuckers
who are the
president and
the secretary
of state
right now
actually believed
that there
would be a
country called
Sunnistan?
Are we
fucking
five-year-olds?
Jesus Christ.
And when I
say are we
fucking
five-year-olds,
fucking was
an intensifier
there,
but thanks
to Jeffrey
Epstein,
we now know
that a lot
of these
people are
literally
fucking
five-year-olds,
allegedly,
not allegedly.
There was
this gray-led
sense of
time passing
and nothing
really happening
and no
particular progress
and eventually
wanting to
withdraw from
these wars.
Stepwise at
first,
fucking Barack
Obama,
I think it was
during the
presidential debate,
saying,
I'm not
opposed to
all war,
I'm opposed
to stupid
wars.
And by
stupid wars,
he meant
Iraq,
and by
good wars,
smart wars,
he meant
Afghanistan,
which is
mentally ill.
So we
withdraw some
troops,
but then some
troops go
back in,
and then
there's
ISIS,
which was
probably
created
primarily by
elements of
the American
intelligence
community,
and then we
gotta put
people back
in for
ISIS,
and then
Afghanistan
needs to
be
restabilized,
and then
fuck,
Syria,
goddammit,
what are we
gonna do?
We really
wanna get
this Assad
guy out of
there.
We've been
planning to
do this
since literally
days after
September 11,
2001.
So what are
we gonna do?
What are we
gonna do?
Okay,
brainstorm
liberal
interventionism,
Samantha
Power,
get on
that,
Antony
Blinken,
get on
that.
We need
to say
it's about
women's
rights in
Syria.
And we
are defending
women's
rights from
the horrific
Assad regime
by putting
them in
the hands
of a
bunch of
Al-Qaeda
offshoots,
most famously
Jabhat Fateh
al-Nusra,
which became
Jabhat Fateh
al-Sham,
and ISIS.
We're
fencing ISIS
a billion dollars
worth of
Libyan guns
by giving
them to the
Free Syrian
Army,
who we know
will immediately
sell them
to ISIS.
There is
just this
kind of
American
general sense
of hell
happening
elsewhere,
of the rest
of the world
as an
endless kind
of mud
or sand
pit,
where people
who can't
get a solid
footing
are desperately
trying to
kill each
other,
and the
reasons for
trying to
kill each
other go
back to
some,
you know,
prehistorical
biblical
bullshit
about
just the
incompatibility
of Islam
and Western
civilization,
the kind of
shit that
people like
Flynn and
Bolton love
to talk about,
and we
sort of
vaguely hope
one side
will win
sometimes,
and vaguely
hope another
side will win
other times,
and I think
most of us
are so
intentionally
uninformed
about all
this,
we don't
actually have
a side
per se,
we just,
you know,
we have to
say down
with the
tyrant
Assad,
what that
actually means,
who would
replace him,
how much
of the
country
you're
willing to
give to
Al-Qaeda,
you know,
whether you
want Raqqa
to be in
the hands
of ISIS
for the
next hundred
years,
these are
details we
can iron
out.
Look,
as the
man in
the recording
studio loves
to say,
we'll fix
it in
post,
right?
And
this
fucking
horror
in Gaza,
I think,
is a
cracking
of that
shell
that
separates
us
from the
rest of
the world
and the
actual
consequences
of our
actions
there.
It is
a,
you know,
that hermetic
engraving
of the
man
peering
through
the veil
that surrounds
the world
and seeing
the actual
heavenly
spheres.
And I
think for
some people
it has
mobilized
and galvanized
them in
exactly the
way that
you would
hope.
But I
think for
others it
has paradoxically
made things
less credible
because they
can't believe
they would be
allowed to
see an
allied
government
that they
have spent
their entire
lives being
told to
support drop
a fucking
hospital in
on not
just doctors,
not just
patients,
not even just
patients who
are running
out of fuel,
electricity,
the most
basic
hygienic
and sanitary
supplies.
I mean,
people are
having fucking
surgeries with
no painkillers
or Novocaine,
no anesthesia
at all.
People are,
you know,
they're having to
stanch wounds
with paper towels
because they don't
have any fucking
tourniquets.
They're having to
reuse hypodermic
needles over
and over
and over,
which is the
same thing
we forced
Iraq to do
in the 90s
during the
sanctions
when between
the two
Gulf Wars,
if you want to
call them that,
never forget
this number,
that American
sanctions in
that roughly
decade-long
period in
Iraq killed
500,000
children at
least.
There is no
death count
for adults,
but at the
very least
half a million
children.
And a big
part of that
was a blockade
against medical
supplies that
meant if you
have two
syringes for
an entire
fucking surgical
ward,
all you can
do is use
them,
bleach them
if you can
have bleach,
but that might
be blockaded,
you know,
put them over
a flame if you
have a flame,
but hey,
no fuel,
no flame,
and just pray
to God that
you don't spread
anything to the
next person.
And so the
death toll from
what is going
on in Gaza
right now,
the same way
the death toll
from what has
been going on
in Iraq for
the better part
of 30 years,
we're never
actually going to
know because we
will never know
how many people
not just died,
let's not put it
that way,
active voice,
they died as if
they made a choice
to die.
No,
how many people
were killed
not just by
bombs,
not just by
the IDF,
not just by
the billions
of dollars
worth of
American weapons,
but by the
fact that
they had,
let us say,
treatable injuries
or treatable
diseases.
They were shot,
but in a
non-lethal
place and
could have
lived.
You know,
they were even
amputated from
the knee down,
amputated from
the elbow or
the shoulder
down,
but they
could have
lived.
They had
diseases,
spikes of
horrific shit
because,
as I mentioned
last time,
95% of the
water in Gaza
is contaminated
with human
feces.
Diseases like
cholera or
tomean poisoning,
whatever,
that could have
been treated
and it
wasn't even
the guns
and bombs
that killed
them.
It was the
refusal to
allow doctors
to treat
them.
It was that
we're not just
caving in the
roofs of
hospitals with
fucking J-dams.
That's not
enough.
No, even a
hospital that
we're not
pancaking,
we're not
going to allow
them to have
the most basic
necessary medical
supplies,
right?
And the
horror of
this, the
absolute
vertiginous,
just monolithic
horror of
this, I
think has an
odd effect
in making
Americans who
are correctly
very paranoid,
who are
correctly,
not all the
time, but
often hesitant
to believe the
official narrative
on anything,
apply that
paranoia in
exactly the
wrong way,
and see
these
unimaginable
crimes,
often live
as they're
happening,
and think,
well, Israel
wouldn't let
itself get
caught doing
that,
obviously.
I mean, if
Israel was
going to
murder the
entire family
of a journalist
as revenge,
they wouldn't
tell people,
they wouldn't
get on TV
and say that.
If Israel
was going to
conduct a
genocide,
certainly,
certainly,
the defense
minister wouldn't
get on TV
before it
happened and
say, we are
fighting human
animals and we
act accordingly.
Certainly, the
former Israeli
ambassador to
Germany wouldn't
get on Israeli
TVs and say,
these people are
not human beings,
they're animals.
I mean, that would
give the whole game
away, right?
So there must be
something else at
work here, huh?
There must be
some hidden plot.
Things are not as
they seem.
And because the
same Americans who
are rightly
paranoid and
suspicious are
often very stupid
as well, they
jump to the
exact inverse of
whatever they're
told, namely,
this must be
Palestine doing
it to itself,
trying to get
Israel in trouble
for war crimes,
trying to ratchet
up international
support, which
is, I mean,
there's no point
in arguing with
that, is there?
There's really
hardly anything
to say.
If people can
bring themselves
to believe that
after seeing the
things we have
all seen, if
people can watch
that footage and
continue to tell
themselves, oh,
no, no, no, no,
this is, see, it's
a very clever game
they're playing
here.
It's what's called
a false flag
strategy.
Then, I'm
sorry, you're
all going to
hell.
If hell doesn't
exist, it will
be invented for
you.
And, in
keeping with
that, in
keeping with
the sudden
exposure of
the machinery
at the actual
center of the
world, I think
we really have
to save some
venom here for
the concept of
clean war.
And, more
particularly,
that bombings
and airstrikes
are clean
war.
A doctrine
that was, you
know, it's got
all kinds of
antecedents back
to rolling
thunder in
Vietnam, back
to the firebombing
of Dresden.
And, I know I
said this on
Twitter, by the
way, but
every stupid
motherfucker
comparing the
destruction of
Gaza to the
firebombing of
Dresden in a
positive way,
like, oh,
that's what you
get, fucking
Nazis, mess
with the
bull, you
get the
horns.
Dresden was
an enormous
war crime.
Dresden was
principally
planned, in
concept, if not
in execution,
by Winston
Churchill.
And, Winston
Churchill's
express purpose
in the Allied
firebombing of
Dresden was not
to hit military
targets.
It was to
hit targets
of no
military
significance
whatsoever.
The targets
were, I
believe these
were on the
north side of
the city, the
working-class
slums of
Dresden, because
they realized
that these
slums were
built often
in, you
know, gigantic
block-long
sort of
compound
tenements and
so forth, and
that they were
mostly made of
wood, not
stone, cement,
concrete,
iron, any
of that, mostly
rickety-ass
wooden shanties.
And so
firebombing would
kill an
enormous amount
of people who
weren't killed by
the initial blast,
right, who
didn't die in
the strike, the
bombing per se,
who will die in
the fire
afterwards.
This was
specifically
planned.
I want to
emphasize this.
In Churchill's
mind, in the
minds of the
Allied military
personnel who went
along with it,
the goal was
we want
poor, blue-collar
and lower
workers living
in slum
hell, starving,
you know, war
rationed into
non-existence,
people who aren't
fighting for the
Third Reich.
We want them to
die either because
we drop a bomb
on them, or
even better,
those bombs
spread such
enormous fires
that the
oxygen will be
sucked out of
their lungs,
they will fall
to the floor,
and if smoke
inhalation doesn't
get them,
they will get to
feel themselves
being burned
alive.
That was the
point.
That was the
express purpose
of Dresden.
So every time I
see someone go,
you got a dude
of fucking, you
know, Gaza
2023, what the
Allies did,
Dresden, well,
they are, they
are in fact doing
that.
They are massacring
a gigantic and
innocent civilian
population in the
most nightmarish
kind of way.
So as I say,
the delusion of
clean war via
bombs, via
airstrikes, goes
back a while,
but it really, I
think, has its
modern foothold in
Donald fucking
Rumsfeld.
And I did a
show, I think
probably a couple
years back at this
point, about
Rumsfeld and how
essentially, for
all that he was
forced to, you
know, resign as
Secretary of
Defense and so
forth, he won.
That guy won the
Iraq war more
than anybody else.
And he won in
the sense that
although he was,
of course, a
diehard neocon,
and although he
spent years and
years shilling for
wars in
Afghanistan and
Iraq and far
more than that,
he was not
actually a, you
know, traditional
mass-scale
military invasion
type of guy.
Donald Rumsfeld
was into the
idea of light
footprint wars.
And that idea
might have
perished as
one of the,
you know,
bygone delusions
of neoconservatism
if it hadn't been
taken up by a
certain Barack
Obama and by
the fucking
cannibal brain
trust of foreign
policy people he
keeps around him,
like Blinken,
like Flournoy,
like Samantha
Power, just
absolute monsters
who decided,
you know,
actually,
Rumsfeld was
on to something.
The problem with
Afghanistan and
Iraq wasn't
really the wars.
The problem was
how we fought
the wars.
And here comes
that phrase we
all know and
love,
liberal
interventionism.
That what if,
what if,
what if,
instead of
announcing two
gigantic goddamn
wars and
sending every
person and
every dollar
and every gun
we can muster
to those wars?
What if we
fought wars
that were
conducted almost
exclusively by
special forces,
by private
military contractors,
by CIA
working in
various capacities,
and by
drone pilots?
We could put,
you know,
get the right
200 people
and put them
in Somalia,
put them in
Niger,
put them in
Eritrea,
wherever,
and we can
have,
you know,
double the
positive effect
of the Iraq
war,
which,
as some of you
may be thinking
right now,
two times zero
is still zero.
Nothing from
nothing means
nothing,
as the man
once said.
We can
double the
benefits of
Iraq,
of Afghanistan,
by doing
these things
in a small,
clean,
light footprint
kind of way.
And,
I don't know
what the number
on this
is now,
but the
authorization
for the use
of military
force bill
that was
initially passed
right after
September 11th,
that in theory
authorized
American military
adventurism
in Afghanistan,
and you
will remember
this is the
period when
the CIA
was sending
anthrax to
a couple
prominent
proponents
of the
Patriot Act.
That 2001
AUMF
was intentionally
worded
incredibly
loosely,
such that
anywhere
we considered,
any nation
we considered
to be
harboring
or supporting
or giving
aid and comfort
to Al-Qaeda
in any
sense,
because now
we can call
any group
we want
a splinter
group of
Al-Qaeda,
right?
We can,
you know,
make up
fucking
organizational
charts all
day.
I mean,
there is,
I think,
quite persuasive
evidence that
Al-Qaeda as
such did
not exist
until we
needed to
make a case
in the
attempted
1993
World Trade
Center bombing
and realized
that
if we
could
build up
a largely
fictional
organizational
chart
that had
Osama bin
Laden at
the top
of it,
we could
charge
bin Laden
under
RICO
statutes,
right?
The same
way we
used to
charge
mob
bosses
for things
that their
underlings
did.
And that
Al-Qaeda
itself was
kind of a
loose
catch-all
for the
so-called
Afghan
Arabs,
the
Mujahideen
we imported
to
Afghanistan
starting in
1979
or so.
And if
you consult
the official
histories,
you will
hear that
Al-Qaeda,
which means
the base,
referred to
the compound
that bin Laden
had in
Afghanistan.
If you ask
some other
people,
including some
people who
used to work
at the CIA,
they will
tell you that
Al-Qaeda,
the base,
referred to
their database
of the
Mujahideen
operatives
that they
were running
in Afghanistan.
But hey,
bygones be
bygones,
right?
Why are we
worried about
all this
old shit?
Al-Qaeda
comes into
being,
essentially,
as an
American
legalist
sort of
point of
contention
that allows
us to
sue,
go after
anyone we
want,
who we
can claim
is in
some sort
of leadership
role in
this organization
that we
kind of just
conjured out
of thin air.
And then,
of course,
as would
have been
obvious to
anyone but
the people
who run
the world,
the sort
of attention
that attracts
massively
increases the
prestige of
this,
you know,
barely an
organization,
this fucking
ragtag
network,
and suddenly,
they are
the place
to be
if you're
an Islamist
fucking
psychopath,
to say
nothing of
the Islamist
psychopaths'
profound,
practical,
if not
ideological
friendships
with the
CIA and
the American
National
Security State.
My point
here is
that that
AUMF vote
in 2001
that was
sold as
the war
in Afghanistan,
last time
I checked,
that vote
has been
used to
undertake
American
military
operations
in 86
countries.
That vote
was worded
so widely
and so
vaguely
that it
essentially
guaranteed
a future
of these
light footprint
wars,
right?
That Rumsfeld,
he never got
to see the
day by God,
but Barack
Obama
brought
that
fucking
prophecy
home.
And
it is
to me
one of
the
great
moral
obscenities
of our
time.
One of
the great
blasphemies
against the
idea
that there
is or
ever has
been or
ever could
be
anything
decent
about the
human
fucking
species
that we
can call
raining
hellfire
from the
air
onto
civilians
a clean
war,
a light
footprint
war,
a decent
war,
a just
war,
a smart
war.
It's that
smart war
that those
fucking
Obama
people loved.
And to
say nothing
of the
fact that
there's
basically
no evidence
that any
of this
has ever
worked
at all,
at least
worked in
the way
it was
promoted.
Now,
I think
you could
make a
great case
that it
has worked
for all
kinds of
secretive
actual
purposes
for which
it was
designed.
But,
you know,
for the
moment,
let's stick
with the
surface
story.
This
shit
doesn't
work.
I
personally
doubt that
it was
ever really
meant to
work as
such.
But,
if evaluated
on its
own merits,
there is
something,
to me,
fucking
chilling
in how
thoroughly
this
encapsulates
the
American
view of
the
world.
The
terror
bombing
campaign,
the pilot
doing the
flyover,
the drone
operator
in his
little
fucking
trailer
tractor
somewhere
in New
Mexico,
that is
the most
condensed
American
cosmology
I can
think of
in the
present
era.
It is
the kind
of image
you would
show
someone
2,000
years ago
or 2,000
years in
the future
to explain
who Americans
were and
what we
did.
That we
got in
cockpits
of planes,
some of
which can
fly faster
than the
speed of
sound,
and we
got kitted
up with
all this
incredibly
expensive,
sophisticated
machinery.
We also
got just
fucking
teeth
grindingly
high on
modafinil.
It's probably
better known
to the
audience here
as Vyvanse.
I don't know
if that stuff
was developed
for fighter
pilots,
but it's
definitely
used by
fighter pilots
as they
call it a
wakefulness
promotion
agent,
right?
So what
we have
is a
speed freak
covered in
millions of
dollars worth
of personal
protective and
life support
equipment,
and he
gets in a
plane,
and he
flies a
pre-programmed
route,
and he
has billions
of dollars worth
of machinery
in screens
and buttons
and gauges
and dials
and switches.
He doesn't
even need
to know
what he's
bombing.
He doesn't
care to know
why.
Why the fuck
would we tell
him that?
He's not
really interested
in the specific
target.
That's all in
the mission
briefing.
Someone else
takes care of
that shit,
and if he
hits the
wrong thing,
number one,
it's someone
else's fault,
and number two,
we'll just say
the other side
did it,
right?
The idea
that we see
just war,
we see clean
war,
we see moral
war,
in a man
inside a
hermetically
sealed bubble,
going thousands
of miles an
hour over
the surface
of the earth,
and just
pressing a
button when
the machinery
tells him
the target
is locked
in,
and we
do not
see the
people on
the ground
who are
the target.
The idea
that it
is a sort
of new
great frontier.
After the
frontier thesis,
Frederick Jackson
Turner and
all that,
after the
apocalyptic
dread of
having gotten
to the edge
of America,
run out of
land,
run out of
its free
real estate,
and having
failed to find
any sort of
new Eden,
any sort of
great historical
revelation,
any, you
know,
millenarian
apocalypse that
would finally
unveil the
truth to us,
we have now
managed to
invent a
terrain in
which there
is nothing but
new frontier.
Up there in
the sky,
just pressing
the buttons that
we're told to
press,
just grinding
our fucking
teeth,
getting locked
off from
amphetamines,
just waiting
until the
little screen
says target
acquired,
and you flip
the switch,
and you press
the button,
and that target
could be anything
at all,
and you don't
have to care.
the idea of
a man or
woman up
there,
literally
hermetically
sealed,
literally as
cut off from
anything to
do with
the earth,
and its
surroundings,
and its
life,
and its
death,
and its
fucking
humanity,
as anyone
could possibly
be,
sailing along
this infinite
new frontier
of murder,
you know,
mapping this
infinite coast
of slaughter,
with no
regard at all,
not just for
human life,
of course they
don't have any
regard for
human life,
but for the
very existence
of this planet
as a place
where anything
has ever
lived and
grown and
died and
in dying,
been transmuted
into new
life.
To me,
that is the
definitive image
of the
American
frontier,
post-frontier,
of the
American
post-radioactive
frontier,
the American
nuclear frontier,
that we
can move
omnidirectionally
thousands and
thousands of
miles above
the earth,
because up
there direction
means very,
very little,
we just have
to cruise
around on a
pre-programmed
flight path
until the
button says
go,
and when
the button
says go,
we go,
and by the
time we
land,
we have
completely
forgotten
whom we
were up
there to
murder,
and I keep
emphasizing that
word murder,
because I have
been thinking
these last two
weeks as well
of, you know,
some of you,
some of you
who listen to the
show probably
have children,
or want
children,
maybe you have
nieces and
nephews,
some of you may
even have
grandchildren,
I don't know,
and if there
is enough time
left in human
history for
those kids to
grow up,
and I hope
there is,
but I don't
have a good
feeling about
it,
I'm thinking
of them asking
you about this,
saying,
do you remember
that war,
that war,
do you remember
the war,
Israel-Gaza
2023,
and thinking
that we need
to be ready
to say,
in the words
of a song
that's been
stuck in my
head this
whole time,
there was
no war,
that wasn't
a war at
all,
I'll tell you
what happened,
over and
over and
over and
over,
more times
than I can
possibly say,
somebody got
murdered.
he's
he's
the
guitar solo
Some of God takes a swig and passes back a job
But where they were last night, no one can remember
Somebody got murdered, the bond that keeps forever
Somebody got murdered
Somebody's dead forever
You're minding your own business, carrying spare change
You wouldn't call your barber, you're hungry all the same
I've been very tempted to grab it from the till
I've been very hungry, but not enough to kill
Somebody got murdered
Somebody's dead forever
can do so
I won't call your sponge
