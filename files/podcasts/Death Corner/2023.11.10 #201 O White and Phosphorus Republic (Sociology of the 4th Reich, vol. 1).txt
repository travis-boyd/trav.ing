I have therefore chosen this time and place to discuss a topic on which ignorance too often abounds and the truth too rarely perceived.
And that is the most important topic on earth, peace.
What kind of a peace do I mean and what kind of a peace do we seek?
Not a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war.
Not a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war.
Not a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war.
Not the peace of the grave or the security of the slave.
I am talking about genuine peace.
The kind of peace that makes life on earth worth living.
The kind that enables men and nations to grow and to hope and build a better life for their children.
Not merely peace for Americans, but peace for all men and women.
Not merely peace in our time.
Not only abuse, but a peaceurope and peace for Americans, but Assistance isn't a peace.
Not only peace for Americans, but racism, but a strong
разделing around us all is drainage against ourselves.
Knowing peace for Americans with nuclear feelings and flood love.
Well, you know, I got this file on my computer called Shrapnel.
A file that has migrated over probably three laptops over the course of maybe 13 years, back to the time when all I did, all I was concerned with, was living in a tiny little room and writing at least 2,000 words a day, every day, for the better part of a decade.
That was my entire life for a long time.
And this file, Shrapnel, it's made up of stuff that caught my eye, that made me pause, that grabbed my attention, and I didn't know what I was going to use it for, how I was going to use it.
Often it's stuff I'm not even really sure what it meant at the time, or I know nothing about the source, but it was something I knew I would need to hold on to for some reason.
And I was looking for something else today and came across that shrapnel file and found a little bit of it that I've read probably 50 times over the last decade.
That in Haiti, as they insist correctly, you say it in Crown Heights, in the decades before the Haitian Revolution, there were a number of enslaved Africans who escaped slavery and took to the forests of Haiti, both to hide themselves and to start sort of, you wouldn't call them communes exactly,
exactly because they weren't organized on that level.
But what I guess you might refer to in modern terms as something of a mutual aid project, helping each other out as escaped slaves need a lot of help.
And some of those communities of escaped slaves became, if not the military, then the political basis for the proper Haitian Revolution.
Sometime around 1800, 1801, you know, Toussaint Louverture and Robert de Salines and all the famous guys.
And the reason this caught my eye is that among these, you know, quasi communes of escaped slaves living in the rural part of Haiti where, you know, the white colonists didn't know how to get around.
The act of escaping to the forest was called stealing your own corpse.
That was their diction for it.
That if you got out, if you escaped, then you had stolen your own corpse.
And obviously it's very difficult to reconstruct the religion and cosmology of enslaved Africans, you know, over 400 years ago in some cases.
We only have the things that have come down to us through modern incarnations of what they may have thought.
Things like, you know, Vodun or Vodin or however you want to pronounce it.
Lukumi, Makumba, Santeria, you know, all that sort of stuff.
All these syncretic religions that married bits of West African religion to sometimes indigenous American religions to the Christianity that was enforced upon all these people.
And in some versions of these syncretic phenomena, right, it would appear, especially going by Vodun, that these people, these enslaved people and the generations that came after them,
conceived of the enslavement in Africa and the trip to the Americas quite correctly as a literal death and a literal forced migration to the land of the dead.
That once you were over here, enslaved in the Americas, you were actually dead.
And that in some versions of these religions, the concept of, you know, heaven or the good afterlife was called Guinea, as in the part of Western Africa they had been taken from.
That they conceived of the Middle Passage, the Transatlantic Crossing, as a much more violent and malignant version of all the classical mythology about, you know, crossing the rivers into the underworld.
Charon and the ferry across the sticks and the river of Lethe that makes you forget your life.
Charon and the river of Lethe that makes you forget your life.
Charon and the river of Lethe that makes you forget your life.
Charon and the river of Lethe that makes you forget your life.
I want to talk, I want to talk tonight about the degree of seriousness with which I use certain terms like that one, but in particular the term forthright.
Charon and Nancynings and anytime below Frank is a economic occupational Peace statement, art ability, that following the law itself has Rita and Earth mulkey, which I use certain kinds of information with which I use for sure if I use certain things.
And I use certain things like my life, I use gender, melons as a poet and que 듯이, that many of the people have seen of beauty so much egregious.
We've yet changed again today.
And I use certain circumstances so much the hemat, that many of theких vídeo's consciousness is completely inaccurate about how to give me their l major meaning it has і mage a Brosncer, i n隨zz of lizz e g Inspector the website ibseter, i.
I've never heard of that before in based Libras.
So, if there's any folks in包 þ are all a people hall........hyse.
fellas Rolding the sky.
Here's electricity to be very little bit ambienteichten.
as it refers to what is going on now in Gaza,
and now increasingly in the West Bank,
that in a sense,
it is absolutely obscene
for an observer or spectator
to say anything about that.
How fucking dare I have an opinion?
How fucking dare I let a word cross my lips
about suffering beyond what I can possibly imagine?
And I want to be very direct and clear about this.
Maybe not in the sense of scale,
maybe not in the sense of pure temporal duration,
maybe not in raw numbers,
however you wish to count those,
but what we, and by we I mean,
the Western capitalist bloc
and the 80% American weaponry in the hands of Israel,
what we are doing to Gaza right now
is as bad as anyone,
as bad as anything that anyone has ever done to anyone.
Full stop on that.
I'm not taking arguments.
Yeah, sure, it hasn't lasted as long yet.
It hasn't stacked up the fucking bodies
that some rather perverted Swadizone students of history
would use to morally evaluate it,
but it is as bad as anything
a human being has done to another human being.
There is no question about that.
There can be no serious argument with that.
So it is in one sense horrifying
that I would try or bother to say anything at all.
And I assume most of you are in the position
of being observers and spectators as well.
I guess it's possible that some of you may be Palestinian
or have family over there.
And God, if that is the case,
the only words I can think to say,
the words I was trained to say in my youth
are God bless you and keep you in all of your ways.
And I mean that in complete sincerity.
And I don't mean it the way the perverts
in the society of Jesus taught me to mean it,
but I mean it.
I mean exactly what I am saying.
God bless you and keep you in all of your ways.
But for most of you, for the larger remainder,
you will be observers, all right?
This is one side of the paradox.
On the other side, we can't keep quiet.
I mean, what greater sin could there be?
And you have to resolve in yourself that exact question.
Is it a greater sin to talk endlessly
from a spectatorial position?
Is it a greater sin to observe and observe and observe
as if your observing changes
what is happening to human beings right now?
Or is it a greater one to keep quiet?
And obviously, to some degree and in some sense,
keeping quiet is worse, right?
Because we do need people spreading this information.
We do need people disseminating
these horrifying fucking photos and videos.
These messages that end up being
the last living words of people
who thought they were going to have normal days
to the extent that anything can be normal anymore.
We need people spreading the notifications
from the surgeons
at the very few functioning medical facilities
still left in Gaza.
So sure, yes.
But beyond that, above that,
what can you as an observer say
that is not just more observation?
Because we don't really need any more fucking observation.
We have a whole observation industry.
Some of the best paid people in the world
are people who are paid to observe.
Did you see that miserable old piece of shit?
Hillary Clinton saying,
a ceasefire would be a gift to Hamas.
See, you don't know how these people think.
I dealt with Hamas over many, many years.
And you simply don't get
that a ceasefire is exactly what they want.
Hillary Clinton's primary dealing with,
as she would call them terrorists, I would say,
was arming them both in Libya
and then using the arms from Libya
to arm Al-Qaeda offshoots in Syria
and to fence them through the free Syrian arming to ISIS.
So she does know a fair amount
about the arming of terrorist groups.
But none of that applies to anything going on in Gaza.
And I hate to think of filling the world
with more fucking commentary.
Even if the commentary is less,
I don't know,
I suppose the word would be demonic than that.
Less, how shall I say,
self-evidently devil-worshipping
than the things Hillary Clinton says.
And I think perhaps for the instant,
the most useful thing I can say and do,
instead of, you know,
rehashing statistics and scenes
and public statements
that you have all heard and seen
a thousand times over by this point,
is to talk about the role of observer
as observer.
To talk about what it means
that we are observing this.
And what it means that this is being presented
for our observation.
And this, I think,
is an absolutely vital and central characteristic
of what I have called
and will continue to call
the Fourth Reich.
And I don't know how long this is going to take.
I don't know whether this will be
an episode, two episodes, whatever.
But I hope to make plain
on a number of levels
why Fourth Reich is not a phrase
I chose haphazardly.
It's not just me going,
oh, what's the worst thing?
Oh, Nazis.
Okay, so we're like Nazis.
It is not the sort of,
the sort of public activity
simply designed to elicit a reaction
from people who are going to object to it.
You know, those of you who know
some music history,
who maybe grew up as bonks,
as bonk rockers,
you'll know that some of the early punk bands,
British ones in particular,
would wear swastikas
in the early days.
That kind of got left behind
once they started getting put on TV
and so forth.
And, yeah, some of them were just
actual Nazis.
I mean, there's some buried history
of the Ramones
that people tend not to know about.
Joey Ramone talking on stage
about how his biggest regret
was that he was too young
to fight in the Vietnam War
before it was decided that,
oh, this whole punk thing
is actually trending to the left,
so you better pretend to be on the left.
Yeah, some of them were just pieces of shit.
But for other people,
especially on the British side
of the punk thing,
wearing a swastika,
albeit extremely stupid
and ill-advised,
was not so much a declaration
of empathy
or ideological concordance
with the Nazis.
It was just the biggest fuck you
they could think of.
It was the most offensive thing
that came to mind
in terms of a simple,
direct public gesture
particularly on an island
that Germany had bombed
the shit out of, right?
That is explicitly not
what I am doing
when I say Fourth Reich.
I am not throwing
a fucking swastika
on a picture of fucking John Kerry
to get a reaction.
There are reasons I am saying this
and I think some of them
I have made clear
over years in past episodes,
but some more, I think,
require further clarity.
And one of them is this.
In talking about the role
of spectator, of observer,
there is a horrible truth
to this thing I call
the Fourth Reich,
which is essentially, you know,
American-centric
Western capitalism
from the end of World War II forward.
And that horrible truth
is that in a very real sense,
albeit not the sense
in which most people
would use these words,
we are the subjects of history.
Now, when I say subject,
I do not mean protagonist.
I do not mean that we are
the leads of history.
We're the main actors.
We're the most important characters.
No, no, no, no, no.
This is not,
as the demented TikTok Zoomers
like to talk about,
a main character moment.
No, fuck no.
I mean subjects
in the sense of
a laboratory experiment.
Subjects in the sense
of an experimental trial.
Because I think anyone
who's listening to this
probably knows,
probably has known
for a long time,
that history
does not equal
what happened.
History does not equal
the actual experience
of living people,
of people who have
died en masse
in the process
of creating history.
History is not
any sort of
transparent
or even translucent
simple record
of events.
It's not fucking
geological strata.
history is something
made
exactly the same way
reality
is something made.
And
Westerners,
citizens
of the Fourth Reich,
Reichsbürgers
that we are,
we are the subjects
of history
in that sense
in that history
is made
for us.
The powers
that control
this earth,
the accuser
who is the lord
of this world,
take the raw material
of whatever
is actually happening
and shape it
into history
for our consumption
and edification.
And history
applies,
history obtains,
history is taken
to be
normative
and universal,
even though it's not,
on the condition
that it meets
with our approval,
that it works
well on us.
Right?
Think of this
as a pharmaceutical
trial.
Think of those
who produce history
taking the raw,
unspeakable wreckage
of what America
does in this world,
of what the West
has done
to every living
thing,
much less humanity,
and think of them
fucking digging
through that
infinitely large
garbage pile
that, you know,
Walter Benjamin,
angel of history
being pulled backwards,
watching the wreckage
pile up in front of him
but unable to do anything
because the wind
is always blowing him
further and further
into the future
and this storm
is what we call
progress.
Think of that.
The endless
slag heap,
the unspeakable
reduction
of what was
once life
to a
fused series
of chemicals,
essentially,
to a sort of
hybrid
biomechanical
alloy.
You know,
think of the
seance scene
in Gravity's Rainbow
about which,
by God,
I will still do
something.
And the idea
of history
there
as the
compacted
strata
of the
earth's mind
from which
we will pull
out new
molecules,
new substances
that will be
turned to our
purposes.
But we will
think we are
in control.
We will think
we have attained
control
and we will
think we have
attained
the science
of synthesis
and all of this
will be wrong
because the
things we pull
from history
are not inert.
are not
without life.
Are not
without something
that if you
prefer,
you may want
to call
sentience
or even
volition.
There is a lot
more deciding
going on
within those
molecules
than there is
among the
people manipulating
them.
But so long
as we stick
to the level
of manipulation,
that's what
history is,
right?
Digging down
through the
billions of
years of
hydrocarbon
wreckage,
dead cities
on top
of dead
cities,
corpses
piled on
top of
piles of
corpses,
and seeing
what on a
molecular basis
we can drag
out of them
for a useful
new product
for an era
with its own
challenges,
its own
demands,
and its own
spectacular
horizons.
History is
grave robbing.
History is
digging up the
dead,
and not just
the human
dead,
so that you
can extract
from them
whatever oils
and bodily
fluids and
chemical essences
will allow you
to construct
some sort
of,
if not even
plausible,
much less
true,
historical
narrative,
then a narrative
that will hold
together in
both the
chemical sense,
that has the
right chemical
affinities,
that has the
right number of
electrons per
each valence
shell,
that will
form easily
into molecules
without very
much testing
and without
very much
chemical or
electrical
encouragement
from the
historians who
are the lab
techs,
right,
in this case,
and that will
hang together
in a sense
that I don't
want to call
narrative,
because it's
really not
narrative.
History as a
narrative,
and especially
the last 80
years doesn't
make any
fucking sense.
As a story,
it's awful.
It's bullshit.
It's not just
that it's evil,
it's also that it
doesn't hang
together in
any way.
It is either
so simplistic
as to be
deadening,
or it is
so full of
lacunae,
so full of
obvious flimsy
lies and
excuses,
that it
collapses under
its own weight,
and that is
why they
are continually
in the process
of reformulating
it.
And we
are the
subjects in
the lab on
which they
are testing
this history,
right?
This is a
way to talk
as observers
about being
observers,
particularly
observers of
and in
and from
the Fourth
Reich.
And I want
to be really,
really clear
here.
I want
you to
think of
all the
mythos
surrounding
Nazi
Germany,
all the
way that
subsequent
culture has
elevated
Nazi
Germany to
this status
of unthinkable
evil,
of,
you know,
that evil
which passeth
the understanding
of man.
And then I
want you to
look around
yourself,
just think
about your
world for a
minute,
whatever you
conceive of
as being
your world,
whether that's
your private
life or
your public
life or
some general
sense of
the life of
nations.
And I want
you to know
right now,
it is exactly
as bad as
the Third
Reich and
arguably much
worse.
You are not
anywhere other
than the
bleakest and
most horrifying
period in the
known history of
humanity.
there is no
veil or
membrane separating
you from the
kinds of
things, in
fact, sometimes
the exact
things that
happened in
Nazi Germany.
Fourth Reich is
not a fucking
metaphor.
It's not an
analogy.
It's not
symbolism.
It is a
simple application
of terms that
we already have
to describe not
only continuity,
but the growth
of that sort
of evil.
you are in a
place where
everything you
can conceive
of relative
to Nazi
Germany,
everything that
is even
tangentially
related to
you, from
architecture to
film to
whatever your
personal imagining
of various sorts
of atrocities and
war crimes are,
to, yes, in
fact, the
Holocaust, where
all of those
things have
metastasized and
grown.
and the
degree to
which you
look around
yourself and
don't see
that, the
degree to
which you
look around
hearing me
say this and
think, I
don't think
that's really
true.
Is that
fair?
Is that
really fair?
I mean, I
know things
are bad, but
that seems a
little bit over
the top.
The degree to
which you
think that is
the degree to
which it
has been
successful.
Because that
metastasis was
designed with
exactly that
sort of
incredulity in
mind, which
is something
that I am
going to get
to at some
length.
Sorry, it's
just there are
certain things
you say, you
know, right?
You've even
thought of
saying, practiced
saying, but to
say them out
loud is
sometimes just a
little bit more
than you can
bear.
I've known
this, fuck,
half a decade
at least,
probably longer
than that.
I have known
it to the
marrow in my
bones.
But having to
ask all of
you, toward
whom I
certainly don't
bear any ill
will, I'm not
trying to be a
fucking harsh
disciplinarian with
you, but trying
to ask all of
you to look
around and
really, really
realize where
we are, that's
something that
evokes a wobbly
pause even in
me.
You can hear
the fucking
wow and
flutter of
the tape that
is coursing
through the
play and read
heads in my
brain.
You can hear
the tape
machine stretching,
going out of
tune, being
misbiased, tape
speed all shot
to hell, multiple
playback heads just
scratching the
fucking oxide
off the
plastic.
And not for
no reason do
I refer to the
tape machine,
since as some
of you may know
from early
episodes here,
tape, audio
tape, magnetic
tape, was
invented at the
express orders of
an Austrian
politician named
Adolf Hitler.
But I have to
say it.
There is no way
around saying
it, because
without that
understanding,
there is no
way around,
or rather,
there is no
way to grasp
your status as
an observer
here, and
not just here.
Gaza is the
atrocity of
the moment,
and I say
that with
absolute loathing
for the phrase
atrocity of
the moment,
because your
status as an
observer is
predicated upon
the possibility
of the atrocity
of the moment.
Thing to
thing, what
are they?
Are they
inhuman sins
from which we
should all
recoil?
Are they
almost impossible,
inconceivable
nightmares for
which every
one of us on
earth should
know that if
there's a hell
below, we're
all going to
go?
No.
You know what
they are?
They're issues.
They're contemporary
world events.
They're interesting
problems, and
this is key to
your status as
a Reichsbürger,
as an observer
from the
Fourth Reich,
because I
begin to see
just over the
last week,
couple weeks,
since I last
spoke, I
begin to see
something about
the coverage
of Gaza,
both mainstream
and less so,
and the
reaction to
coverage of
Gaza.
And what I
am beginning
to see is
the torrent
of specific
horror.
The actual
photos and
videos.
I mean, I
feel like it's
my responsibility
to see the
worst of
things so
that I can
talk honestly
about them.
But that
video of a
man holding
a Palestinian
child, who I
would guess was
probably about
five years old,
and showing the
child's body to
the crowd, and
the entire left
side of the
child's skull
had been blown
away, and there
was no brain
left in that
cavity.
It was just
empty bone.
I am never
going to get
that out of
my head, ever.
And yet, I
feel this
tidal shift
that deeply
frightens me
because it
reminds me of
things that
have happened
in the past.
I feel this
sense that
Gaza, or
rather, Israeli
and American
treatment of
Gaza, is
becoming not
an atrocity,
not the
most urgent
kind of
humanitarian
fucking
emergency.
It's becoming
a problem.
It's becoming
an issue.
It's becoming
something that
concerns the
world.
And when an
atrocity becomes
an issue,
that spells
doom for the
weaker party
involved in
all cases,
because this
is one of
the key
strengths and
one of the
definitive
strengths of
the Fourth
Reich, the
conception and
the maintenance
of the
concept of
endless
catastrophe.
We can take
any event, no
matter how
long-running,
how absurd,
how demonic,
how farcical,
how obviously
easy to fix
if we were
anything close
to human
beings.
We can take
anything and
turn it into
an endless
catastrophe.
And as you
might imagine
from the
phrasing, the
endless holds
precedence over
the catastrophe.
I know I've
talked on this
show probably
more than once
about the
just fever dream
hallucination
years of
the period
between 9-11
and the
official beginning
of the war in
Iraq, about
how every
day was this
demented
slog being
presented with
obviously
bullshit,
fabricated,
pseudo-evidence,
but knowing what
was going to
happen anyway.
Knowing that
there was no
other end to
all of this.
It's not like
anyone was ever
going to say,
you know what,
this is all
fake, so you
can't do a war.
No one has
the ability to
say that to
the United
States.
And that was
horrifying in
its way.
But just as
horrifying was
2006, 7, 8,
by which point
the war, not
only in Iraq,
but in
Afghanistan, had
just become an
endless
catastrophe.
And because of
that endlessness,
it was very,
very easy to
put out of
the front of
your mind.
You know,
the major
battle operations,
the shit that
American, you
know, TV
channels get
unspeakably
erect for,
fucking night
vision footage
of missiles
blowing the
shit out of
downtown Baghdad,
that was all
over.
That had been
over for a
long time.
And instead,
we had entered
what was
presented to
us as
essentially an
eternal slog.
That there
was simultaneously
no reason for
us to be
there and
nothing we
could do.
But also,
we had to
be there and
we had to
keep doing
things because
otherwise that
would constitute
some sort of
victory for
the enemy.
Who the enemy
was in
2006, 7,
8, not
terribly clear.
Still not
terribly clear.
But there
was this
bifurcation,
this double
bind by
which, on
the one
hand, you
understood we
were doing
nothing and
it was
pointless.
But on
the other
hand, you
were told it
was imperative
that we keep
doing all
that pointless
nothing.
And I will
never forgive
Barack Obama.
I'll never
forgive him for
a lot of
things.
But I will
particularly
never forgive
him for
campaigning
sort of
softly,
pseudo against
the Iraq
war, but
offsetting that
by saying,
I'm not
against war.
I'm against
stupid wars.
I like smart
wars.
And the
smart war he
was referring
to was
fucking
Afghanistan.
A 20-year
war whose
main impact
on the world
was to
produce
unfathomable
numbers of
peasant
corpses and
to ramp
up
Afghan
heroin
production
to levels
not seen
for decades.
That heroin
production
incidentally has
now gone
dramatically
back down
under the
Taliban.
I believe
I recently
read that
they had
eradicated
95% of
it, which
is frankly
a bad
business move
on their
part.
But it
would appear
that the
Taliban,
however
disgusting
they may
be in
any number
of ways,
do actually
believe in
something,
which can
scarcely be
said for
any American
at all.
And it
is the
art of
the endless
catastrophe
that in
some ways
defines
citizenship
and spectatorship
in the
Fourth Reich.
We are
trained and
conditioned like
I would say
no one else
in the history
of the world
to accept
that there
is not
one pressing
evil that
must be
destroyed,
except of
course when
we are
gearing up
for a war
which will
inevitably
turn into
20 years
of dead
bodies.
No,
what we have
got here
is a
complex,
multipolar,
many faceted
sort of
world situation.
It is never
what we do,
right?
It is never
actions we
take.
And the
actions we
take are
never
presented
with
counterweights,
are never
presented with
the possibilities
of actions
that either
we could
take in
the future
or that
we need
not have
taken in
the past.
No,
these are
events.
These are
presented to
us as if
they're,
you know,
the fucking
rainy season,
as if these
are earthquakes,
the triangulation
of stars,
something we
could not
possibly have
foreseen or
effected.
they simply
become issues
and events.
And arguably
the key
characteristic
of the
everyday
citizen of
the Fourth
Reich is
the ability
to conceive
of the world
explicitly in
these terms
as a series
of concurrent
issues,
and then as
a series of
fucking
interminable,
meaningless
debates
topics,
about the
meaning of
these issues,
you will
notice if
you go
back and
read editorials,
let's say,
from places
like the New
York Times,
the Washington
Post,
you know,
serious
journalism,
from the
era first
of launching
the Afghanistan
war,
and then the
era of
gearing up
to the
Iraq war,
and you
will notice
something that
I noticed
even back
then and
found bizarre.
there is a
relative paucity
of anyone
explaining what
it is they
think we're
going to do
and what
change that
will affect.
There's very
little, okay,
here's what we
do, we go
in, we do
this, we do
that, we
kill this guy,
we help those
people, and
then, you
know, Iraqi
society will
have stabilized,
blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah.
I mean, the
current president
and current
secretary of
state,
during the
waning
quagmire
years of
the Iraq
war,
seriously
came up
with a
plan to
divide Iraq
into three
new nations
called
Sunnistan,
Shiistan,
and Kurdistan.
The guy
who's now
the president
and the
guy who
is his
number one
delegate in
terms of
world affairs
thought there
were going
to be
countries
called
Sunnistan
and
Shiistan.
That is
the dumbest
bullshit I
have ever
heard in
my life.
And people
say things
like that all
the time when
they are simply
bullshitting,
when they simply
need to get
themselves out
of a, you
know, a little
jam during an
interview where
they're supposed
to look good.
But Biden
and Blinken,
they worked on
that plan.
They appear to
have thought that
was really going
to happen, or
at least, even
if it didn't
happen.
That was the
best possible
resolution to
what was going
on.
And what was
their reasoning?
Their reasoning
was that the
problem with
Iraq isn't
the last 20,
30 years of
what we've
done to
Iraq.
The problem
with Iraq
wasn't building
up Saddam Hussein
and the Ba'ath
party before that
so we could use
them as our
proxy against
Iran in the
Iran-Iraq war
for 10 years.
And it
wasn't the
CIA giving
Hussein nerve
gas and then
telling him where
to deploy it
against Iran in
that war.
And it wasn't
also the
State Department,
really the entire
federal government,
greenlighting the
invasion of
Kuwait and
then treating it
as a horrific
human rights
crime that had
to be answered
with war.
And it wasn't
the highway of
death.
And it wasn't
fucking Iraq
syndrome.
And it
certainly wasn't
the unspeakable
amount of
artillery we
just rained on
that country
for weeks.
It wasn't the
hundreds of
unprosecuted war
crimes we
committed during
even a
relatively short
armed conflict.
And here's one
that no one
ever talks about
and I know
I've said it
before and I'm
going to
fucking say it
again.
It certainly
wasn't.
It certainly
wasn't.
That between
the Gulf War
as such and
the Iraq War
in 2003,
it certainly
wasn't that
American sanctions
against Iraq
killed half a
million children
at minimum.
Children.
We're not
getting into
the adult
body count
at all.
And these
sanctions,
the exact
same sorts of
things you see
being enacted
in real time
in Gaza,
keeping people
from getting
food,
from usable
water,
from surgical
instruments,
from medicine,
from electricity,
half a million
children in
less than 10
years.
Look at the
body counts
you're hearing
out of Gaza
now.
The, you
know,
as last I
knew,
9,000 to
10,000
deaths who
have been
conclusively
identified.
And then
think of
the thousands
upon thousands
who are
either still
under rubble
or who
were blown
apart so
horribly that
they're going
to be impossible
to identify.
And then
think of
the inevitable
tens of
thousands who
are going
to die
for lack
of water,
for lack
of food,
for lack
of medicine,
for lack
of access
to medical
procedures that
doctors in
Gaza absolutely
could perform
except they're
being denied
the instruments
to perform
them with,
the necessary
medicine.
They have no
anesthesia.
They're running
out of fucking
wrapping for
burns.
They've got
patients who
they know,
they know,
need to have
an amputation
quick or they're
going to die,
need to have
burns treated
very quickly in
a very particular
way or they're
going to die.
And they know
exactly what to
do for these
people and
are being
actively prevented
from doing
it.
You need to
factor all
those into
the body
count.
But as
in Iraq,
that's not
the problem,
right?
That's not
the problem.
No, with
Iraq, the
problem was
something to
do with
sectarian and
ethnic
conflict that
I'm sure it
doesn't have
anything to
do with the
way we
disbanded
the Iraqi
military and
encouraged
Shia extremist
groups to
start fighting
the Sunni
extremist
groups, which
in turn led
directly to
the rise of
ISIS.
And in
fact, ISIS
itself may
have been a
direct creation
of American
military intelligence
and the CIA
because funny
things start
happening if
you try to
look into the
imprisonment of
Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi
and how
exactly he
got there
and exactly
what kind of
indoctrination
program he
went through
that turned
him from a
fucking file
clerk to
the alleged
head of the
biggest Sunni
terrorist organization
on earth.
Because who the
fuck knows if
that guy even
really existed?
If the Abu
Bakr al-Baghdadi
you would
sometimes see in
videos was the
same guy who
was in an
American prison
or an Iraqi
prison, don't
know, hard to
say either he
was in an
Iraqi prison for
like three
months or he
was in an
American prison
for like three
years and no
one will talk
about what we
did to him
there or really
why he was
there or really
why he got
out.
No, no, no.
None of that is
the problem, you
see, because here
we believe in
endless catastrophes
and what an
endless catastrophe
needs is issues.
So what do you
do?
What do you do
when you have
just completely
fucking destroyed
one of the
more stable
countries in
the region, a
country that
you armed, that
you provided with
information as
to where and
when and how to
use those arms
against your
main regional
enemy in Iran,
a country that
you greenlit to
basically try to
make its money
back by invading
Kuwait and then
conducted a
horrific war
against, in the
name of human
rights and the
defense of
innocent peoples.
If you're going
to make it an
endless catastrophe
and that's the
only kind we like
here, you need
issues.
You need world
problems.
And so what do
you throw in?
Ethnic tensions,
sectarian
tensions, the
endless quest to
inculcate democracy
into the Middle
East, which is
first of all,
remember, for
fourth-rack
purposes, for
American purposes,
all of the
Middle East is
one thing.
No Middle
Eastern country is
any different from
any other, except
that there are
countries we always
hate and then
there are countries
that we pretend to
like and then
stab in the back.
That's the only
real distinction.
Otherwise, everyone
in any country in
the Middle East is a
Middle Easterner.
They're all
essentially to be
construed as the
same type of
person.
we don't take
seriously the
actual sectarian
conflicts that do
arise because you
really think anyone,
anyone in the State
Department, in the
CIA, gives a fuck
about the
interpretation of
who should have
become the
caliph after
Muhammad died.
I don't.
I think that is
it's fucking
playing poker to
them.
It's rolling
dice.
It's just the
next move, the
next thing you go
to, the next
thing on the list
to check off.
And it is these
sorts of issues,
these sorts of
quasi-permanent
because we're always
talking about their
permanence and how
intractable and how
entrenched and how
deep-seated and how
goddamn complicated
they are.
But then on the
other hand, whenever
we want to do
something, all of
that shit suddenly
disappears.
You notice that
there is not a
whole lot of
talk about the
intractable,
entrenched,
deep-seated
resistance to
democracy in
places like
Saudi Arabia with
our friend
Mohammed bin
Salman, places
like Qatar,
although Qatar is
about to fucking
get it for not
taking Al Jazeera
off the air, as
per the request of
the American
Secretary of State.
I don't hear much
about the inherently
anti-democratic
culture of the
Emirates.
No, because those
people are useful
to us.
So it is a
feature of endless
catastrophe, right?
That it rotates
between issues,
between world
problems, between
current events, and
every one of those
issues is, we are
told, a million
years old and
unchangeable and,
you know, the best
laid plans of mice
and men and the
dreams of reformers
have foundered
against their rocky
shoals for hundreds
of years until we
get to the next
thing, at which
point the thing
before doesn't
matter anymore.
This is so
endemic to the
Western observation
of the world, the
Western spectatorship
of the world,
partly for obvious
reasons, because it
distracts us from
real things like
where the money's
going, how much
of it is going
where, who's
getting killed, who's
getting armed, who's
being allowed to die,
who is being
protected, you
know, all the
actual logistics of
how the world is
run.
Yeah, sure, that's
one part of it, but
I think, I think
critiques of this
sort of spectatorship,
critiques of, you
know, citizenship of
the Fourth Reich,
have emphasized that
part of things, you
know, the obscuring of
the real machinations
of the world, perhaps
a bit too much to the
exclusion of the other
side of things, which
is to say that, yes,
obviously all of that
is there to prevent
any of us from
understanding how
anything really
fucking works, of
course, but you can
do enough of your
own research and find
enough, you know,
unconventional sources
and read the right
sort of books to have
a pretty good working
model of how a given
thing actually happened,
right?
Of how the U.S.
actually operates as
a world power and how
the supposed great
break in history in
which fascism
disappeared forever
and it was only
free market capitalism
versus those goddamn
red communists and
their gulags and how
eventually free markets
won out and now
there's nothing but
free market liberalism
and its self-correction
and the invisible hand
and all that bullshit
from people who
haven't even read
Adam Smith.
Not that I have
either, but I've
read more than they
have.
Yeah, sure.
All of this is
designed to obscure
all of that, but
what it is also
designed to do
is to take
the specific
horror of
something like
Gaza right now
and I'm going to
say it again.
Gaza right now,
aside from
questions of scale,
whatever,
is as bad
a thing
as anyone
has ever done
to anyone.
Gaza is
as deep
and profound
and
nightmare
as human
beings have
ever inflicted
on human
beings and
even if by
some miracle
it all
stopped tomorrow,
that wouldn't
change the
depth of the
horror.
That would not
change the
magnitude of
the diabolical
fucking
savagery.
that would
not erase
one little
blot
of the
Moloch
worshipping
horse shit
that has led
humanity,
if it still
deserves that
name,
to behave in
this way.
It's never
going away.
This is a
stain on the
heart,
brain,
and soul
of everyone
alive.
But even
if it
ended,
even if it
ended
tomorrow,
right,
it would
still be
an issue.
It would
be construable
into an
issue,
a news
item,
something to
be discussed
by experts
in panels
of experts
on television
where,
of course,
you're only
allowed to
appear if
you have
deep
expertise.
And the
fact that
these supposed
experts,
well,
sometimes
contradict
each other,
which you
would think
would trigger
an understanding
in the audience
that there's
some bullshit
going on here.
No,
actually,
when they
contradict
each other,
what it
means is
that things
are nuanced.
And we
fucking love
when things
are nuanced.
We love
to ask why
we can't
have universal
healthcare
in here.
Well,
it's a very
nuanced question.
It's something
we've had to
go over many
times.
I think we've
reached
some equitable
solutions.
A little
story here,
by the way,
just on the
side question
of universal
healthcare.
One of the
goddamnedest
things I've
ever seen
in my life
was Howard
Dean on
Twitter in
his post
public office
career,
working as
a lobbyist
for,
among other
people,
the MEK,
the
completely
fucking
insane
cult that
we still
sort of
pretend is
the rightful
government of
Iran and
is going
to take
over and
pull down
the Islamic
revolution.
I don't think
anyone believes
that,
but you
know,
you've got
to have
a secret
government
in exile.
You've got
to have
your Ahmad
Chalabi's
and everything.
Howard Dean
once said in
the course of
a Twitter
conversation that
early in
Obama's
presidency,
they had
the votes
to get
universal
healthcare.
They had
the votes.
It was
there.
the only
thing they
would have
had to
do is
strip
Joe
fucking
Lieberman
of a
seniority
on whatever
Senate
committee he
was in.
That was
it.
That was
all they
had to
do.
And they
decided not
to because
politics
shouldn't be
done that
way.
That's
dirty pool.
That's not
fighting fair.
And I
don't actually
believe Howard
Dean believes
that.
I don't think
Howard Dean
gives a fuck
about Joe
Lieberman's
chairmanship of
whatever fucking
committee.
I think he
knows that
that explanation
appeals to
an enormous
amount of
people who
like to think
of themselves
as good
people.
Who like to
think of
themselves as
moral and
well-informed
and socially
liberal and
capable of
handling complex
issues.
And then
explains to
them why
actually it's
good that
there's no
universal health
care because
these people are
ultimately concerned
with their
fucking money
and that's it.
And beyond
that with a
sort of
moral
vengefulness
whereby they
all secretly
believe that if
you don't have
health care you
don't deserve
it.
That is at
the root of
a whole lot
of this.
But simply
to say we
were that
close.
that was
all it
would have
taken and
they refused
to fucking
do it.
Anyway,
back to my
main point.
Even if
things stopped
in Gaza as
I finished
this sentence,
there would
nonetheless
remain the
fucking carousel
of issues
and world
problems,
all of which
would be
presented as
if they are
natural disasters
spectators,
in which we
have no
role except
the role
of mediator.
And as
a mediator,
what are we
most concerned
with?
Fixing the
problems?
No, you
can't fix the
problems.
They're world
problems.
They've been
around forever.
They're issues
in the great
family of human
government.
No, you
gotta inject
some fucking
nuance in
there.
Because that's
what we're
here for.
We are, to
the extent
that we are
professional
spectators,
fucking
addicted to
the idea
that nothing
can ever be
clearly wrong.
And if you
think it's
clearly wrong,
that's just
because you
have a
partisan
education on
the subject.
And this,
I think,
is an
outstanding
and profoundly
important
principle of
the Fourth
Reich.
And next
time I'm
going to get
more deeply
into why I
keep insisting
on this
phrase,
Fourth
Reich.
The ability
to conceive
of anything
that happens
in the
world as,
first of all,
a disaster,
a tragedy,
say,
October 7th
and then the
days following.
And to play
both sides
and say,
well, you
know, it's
horrible what's
happening to
civilians in
Gaza, but I
heard that a
member of Hamas
cut off a
baby's arms
and legs and
then tied them
to the ends
of his arms
and legs.
And he walked
around like he
was on stilts and
he was saying in
Arabic, call me
baby killer, call me
baby killer.
So, you know, I
mean, those
civilians by
implication kind of
deserve it is I
guess what I'm
saying, right?
Tragedy at first
and then it is
briefly an
emergency when
people of
actual good
will and
sound mind
and sanity
get a look at
what is really
happening.
Get a look at
this fucking
genocide, at
this ongoing
Holocaust.
And then
it recedes.
Then it fades.
The color goes
out of it a
little bit.
You know that
camera trick
called a
dolly zoom
where you
either move the
camera towards
something while
zooming out or
vice versa and
it makes it look
like things are
moving away and
getting closer at
the same time.
That's what
happens.
It's still there
but it dolly
zooms into the
background.
It becomes part
of the broader
richer tapestry
of world problems,
of current events.
It becomes, you
know, the fucking
the architrave of
the temple.
The classical
scene depicted
up by the roof
that nobody
actually looks at
or pays any
attention to.
It becomes a
detail in the
great fresco,
you see.
And we are
the subjects of
this history in
the sense that
this history has
been concocted
for us.
And it is a
history in which
we are able to
treat absolutely
anything, no
matter how
utterly fucking
wanton and
hideous as a
world problem,
as just another
countervailing force
in a world of
countervailing forces.
And, you know,
you win some and
you lose some and
she goes up and
she goes down.
And if you think
that's bad, if you
think that actually
the same people have
won over and
over and over
and over and
over for the
last 80 years,
and that the fact
that they keep
winning would seem
to indicate
something about a,
I don't know,
a larger political
and economic
structure or
grouping, that
makes you either
paranoid or
simply not
nuanced.
And in the
fourth Reich,
buddy, baby,
honey, girl,
if you're going
to be anything
at all,
my God,
you gotta be
nuanced.
You gotta be
nuanced.
Well, I grew up
in the client state
of a petro king
with a complicated
take on things
like human rights,
but baby,
that's the sacrifice
for bringing joy
to the world.
And I learned young
how the West was won
with Christ,
big heart,
and a bigger gun.
It wasn't enough,
so we took the moon
cause Nazi rocket science
too
can bring joy
to the world.
War on drugs,
this righteous cause
to clear our streets
of criminals
Now civilized
by an opioid
So the Sackler family
can enjoy
spreading joy
around the world
For New York City
The world loves you
When retribution's
surely due
For the zealous
who brought you hell
Boy, the heroes
and languidly
taught them well
How to infiltrate joy
To the world
And do it
To the world
Can't we all
just get along
Like Amazon
And Raytheon
Coming together
To make a drone
To bring us lunch
And kill the sun
In a synagistic
Two for one
Holistic joy
To the world
To the world
Please stop resisting
All the joy
In your world
Just a car full of celebrities
Singing about the joy
In your boat
A string of bad luck
In this final turn
We gathered around
And watched our cities burn
Who could have possibly
predicted this?
Said everyone
So we boldly venture
Into the black
Guided by a ground soundtrack
We'll liberate
Some foreign stars
And stick a flag
On the face of Mars
The beauty of
Starting again
With patience
Zero
And original sin
The mantra rings
Across the land
How clever
Look at us
We've done it again
We're bringing joy
To whole new worlds
You must admit
We've certainly got a life
For bringing joy
To whole new worlds
In time these aliens
Will wonder
Love the joy
Will bring hope
New worlds
We're bringing joy
We're bringing joy
To your world
We've better hope
We don't have cheap bananas
We're bringing joy
We're bringing joy
To your world you better hope
You don't have dead dinosaurs
We'll bring joy
To your world you better hope
You don't have big plans
Or else we'll bring it
To your world you better hope
