I hope you feel so lonely
You could die, I, I, I
Feel so lonely
You could die, I, I, I
You feel so lonely
You could die
Now, Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury
If it's so pleased the court
I would like to redirect the present line of questioning
Toward the overall question of art
The arts
I, I would like to touch upon matters artistic
Because I, I, I may be just a simple
Country, small town, fake lawyer
Who was forced to fabricate his own education and credentials
After being run out of Baton Rouge, Louisiana
In a failed attempt to extort and blackmail a local opium den
Into becoming what I suppose I would refer to now as I did then
I, e, quote
My personal white slavery wonderland, end quote
That may be how I got here
I, I, I'm not too proud to admit such a thing
But being all that as it may
I still have a very, very vociferous and deep-rooted opinions about art
And I would like, frankly
If it so pleased the court
For the jury to go into recess
So that Your Honor and I
Can have a profound
Scintillating conversation
About the nature and philosophy of aesthetics
In general
And their applications to particular artworks
I just don't think we're going to get anywhere in this trial
Without having that conversation
Because that is the way
The South has always run
You know, up there in a Boston town
Where they got all those fancy Ivy League boys
They say, America runs on Duncan
You heard this?
You heard about this?
America runs on Duncan
Well, I'll tell you what
I may not know too much about Boston town
And frankly, I am none too eager to educate myself upon that matter
But I know what the South runs on
The South runs on what it has always run on
There's a system here, right?
And as a man
On the one hand
You have a wife
Who exists to bear you man children
Who will carry on your name and legacy
And then you have another middle-aged or older man
That you are actually in love with
I think we're all familiar with this system
You write each other letters as often as possible
And what you do is you sublimate
Your homoerotic desires
Into an absurdly self-serious
And pretentious form of
What you will call respect for the past
A knowledge of history
And heritage
And the great men who have come before us
And it is this pretense
Which allows we men
To engage in what are
Except for the actual copulative act
What are essentially gay relationships
That's what I'm looking for here
I didn't come into this case
Thinking I was going to win
I mean, let's face it
You're hearing me talk now
You don't think my guy is innocent
Even if he were innocent
I personally just don't have the legal ammunition
To make that case
And if I'm being quite frank
I think he probably did it
I've been talking to this guy for weeks now
And I think he's lying
So as long as the verdict of this court
Is more or less decided in advance
I would like to use this opportunity
To get near another respectable man
Of letters in the law
Outside of the courtroom
I am shunned by all
As a universal disgrace
And I can't really argue with that
But within this context
I think your honor and myself
Might be able to foment
One of those classic southern
Gay without sex marriages
And if your honor would have any interest
In doing such a thing
It doesn't necessarily need to be
During the trial itself
I have a
I don't know if you've checked your desk today
But I wrote down my phone name
My telephone number
And a number of secret
Telephone numbers and addresses
Where I can be found
On specific days of the week
Without anyone knowing about it
So
Folks
Are we about ready to call this thing
A ball game?
Because frankly
We gotta get down to the arts
And that is
What I wanna do
I wanna take a
A little break
From the
The New Gods funeral series
Although
There are gonna be more
There are gonna be a lot more probably
But
Go back to talking about
A specific artwork
For a show
And
In reference to that
A
The phenomenon of
The way art changes over time
The way art is
Plugged into the temporal flow
Such that
It and time
Chemically react with
And upon each other
And
One can have a
Completely blinkered vision
Of something
For years
And years
And then suddenly
Have it lock into place
Because
All those intervening years
Have proven
Exactly what one needed
To understand it
And
I will say
For my part anyway
I rarely
Come to enjoy
Anything
That I once hated
That's not
That's not really how it works
I got pretty strong opinions
About a lot of things
And usually
I
Love something
I hate something
Or I say
This is fine
But it's not of interest to me
And usually
That
Doesn't change
What changes
Is
The depth
Of the affect
Something I love
I keep
Returning to
Over and over
And
Finding out more ways
I love it
And something I hate
And
I will also return to
Things I hate
Sometimes
So as to
Crystallize
My hatred
For them
To figure out
Exactly why
I hate them
So fucking much
And in fact
On most occasions
I would
Much rather
Listen to
You know
An hour long
Playlist
Of shit
That I
Absolutely hate
Than listen to
Sorry if this is
Somebody's favorite band
Out there
But
The Foo Fighters
For instance
R.I.P.
Taylor Hawkins
By the way
That guy was a great drummer
The Foo Fighters
Are just
Nothing to me
The Foo Fighters
Are
What Tom York
Of Radiohead
He referred to
As Fridge Buzz
This sort of
Vaguely
Sincere
Emotional
Kind of
Rock music
That
It passes
Over you
Like
You know
Some sort of
Particulate substance
In the air
It doesn't
Stick
Anywhere
It's not
Terrible
Not at all
It's just
Not anything
But apart
From those
Three basic
Reactions
Love
Hate
Or don't
Care
There is
A fourth
One
That has
Produced
Some of
The most
Interesting
And
Revelatory
Moments
In my
Life
And that
Is when
I hear
Or read
Or watch
Something
And I
Know
As I
Am
Taking
This thing
In
I'm not
Enjoying
It much
Right now
But there's
Something here
There's something
That I'm not
Getting
There is
There is a
Way
I think
That this
Might be
Brilliant
And I
Just don't
Know what
It is
Yet
And
In the
Same way
I would
Prefer
Terrible
Music
To banal
Music
I will
Listen to
An album
Like that
One where
I think
Superficially
Not so
Great
But there's
Something here
I'll listen
To those
All the
Time
And I
Suppose I
Should clarify
For my
Younger
Listeners
That you
Know I'm
I'm not
Talking about
Spotify
Playlists
And shit
I may be
The last
The last
Like under
50
American
Who listens
To music
Primarily by
Having the
Entire
Fucking album
In whatever
Format
You know
LP
CD
MP3
And
Putting on
A really
Nice pair
Of headphones
And
Sitting around
In the
Dark
Listening to
The thing
From beginning
To end
I do
This all
The time
This is
Actually
One of
My major
Activities
As an
Animal
Living upon
Earth
And
I don't
Know
How common
An experience
That is
Among
Even my
Age cohort
Let alone
People
10 years
Younger
Than me
And
In
In that
Sort of
Intensive
Listening
That
Active
Listening
I'll go
Back
Over and
Over to
Things that
Frustrate
Me
Because I
Know there
Is something
There but
I don't
Know what
And
The most
Recent
Kind of
Revelation
I've had
About this
Was with
David Bowie's
Next to
Last album
The next
Day
From
2013
When
When that
Album was
Released
I don't
Know if
People
Remember
This
Because
The release
Of Black
Star
And then
His almost
Immediate
Death
Was such a
Shock
That this
Probably got
Blown out of a
Lot of
People's
Memories
But
At the
Time of
The next
Day
There had
Hardly
Even been
Rumors
About Bowie
Doing anything
He had
Made
Heathen
In I
Believe
2002
And
Reality
In
2003
Or
4
And
While
On the
Reality
Tour
In fact
Almost
Exactly
A month
After I
Saw him
On the
Reality
Tour
He had
Some sort
Of
Cardiac
Problem
On stage
I think
It was
Like a
Nerve
Impingement
That was
Threatening
To put him
Into cardiac
Arrest
Or something
And from
That point
On never
Played live
Again
And
I didn't
Hear anything
For years
About Bowie
And new
Music
And I
Was you
Know
I had my
Ear to the
Ground
The stories
I heard
About Bowie
Including
From some
People
I don't
Know about
Near to
Him
Because I
Don't know
How many
People David
Bowie was
Actually near
To
But people
With whom
He worked
And of
Course Bowie
Is such
A
As an
Artist
Depends so
Much upon
Getting the
Right people
For the
Right jobs
That if
You've played
On a
Bowie
Record
It's not
Just because
You were
Like the
Hot session
Guy in
Los Angeles
And Bowie
Said yeah
Just go
Get me
A guitar
Player
Just get
Me whoever
The hot
Guitar player
Is
It's not
Like that
At all
And one
Of the
One of the
Reasons I
Have compared
Him more
To a
Director
Than a
Songwriter
Or singer
In the
More traditional
Sense
Is that
Bowie
Has always
Been
Meticulous
Not just
About writing
Songs
Writing parts
For those
Songs
Working on
Arrangements
All the
Normal stuff
He is
Also
Meticulous
Was
Also
Meticulous
About getting
The right
People to
Play the
Right
Roles
And in
That sense
He was
Casting them
You know
He
He had
As the
Screenwriter
Director
Producer
He had the
Roles in
Mind already
He knew
Those
From the
Beginning
And he
Chose
People
Not because
They were
Necessarily
You know
The
The most
In demand
Or even
Sometimes the
Most
You know
Technically
Gifted
Or
The most
Sort of
What in
The studio
Session world
We used to
Call a
One take
Jake
The guy
Who you
Know
Gets in
There and
Nails it
In 30
Seconds
And it's
Gone
He picked
The people
Who were
Right for
The roles
And of
Course it's
Not like
Anyone has
Ever played
Badly you
Know on a
Bowie album
It's it's
It's not as
If you know
He he was
Kind of
Scraping the
Bottom of the
Barrel but
He could have
Had I
Mean
Virtually
Anyone for
Any record
Right people
Would drop
All kinds of
Shit to
Play with
Bowie and
Instead he
Picked people
Who often
Were not
Well known
Before they
Played with
Him and
Who have
Often gone
On to
Careers that
Were essentially
Based on
Playing with
Him the
The band
With which
He did
Young
Americans
Station to
Station
Low
Heroes
Lodger
This is one
Of the
Perfect
Examples of
This that
You know
Young
Americans
His fake
Soul record
His plastic
R&B record
Which
Incidentally
I recently
Found out
That the
Working title
Of young
Americans
Was
Shilling
The
Rubes
And I'm
Sort of
Glad he
Changed it
Because that
Would have
Made it a
Little too
On the
Nose
But still
Shitting
Shilling
The Rubes
Is pretty
Fucking good
And he
He knew
He was
Trying to
Hit this
Very
Specific
Nexus
Point
At which
The band
The musicians
The atmosphere
Is you know
A real
East coast
R&B
A black
And to some
Degree
Latino
Sound
You know
The real
Thing
Not a bunch
Of fucking
Englishmen
In a studio
In Somerset
Or whatever
The actual
Guys
And then
Bowie himself
Wanted to
Sort of
Drop into
That context
And use
Himself
The way he
Often did
As the
Alienating
Part
As the
Part
That makes
Everything else
Recontextualize
In a
Often a
Very
Jarring
Extreme
Sort of
Way
I think
I've talked
About
I can't
Remember why
But
I talked
About
Bertolt
Brecht
And the
Various
Ideas he
Had about
What he
Called
Epic
Theater
Among
The many
Other
Appalachians
He gave
It
And
There is
In that
World
In
Especially
20th
Century
You know
Dramaturgy
A term
Called
Verfremdungs
Affect
And
Verfremdungs
Affect
Literally
Means
The effect
Of
Making
Things
Strange
And
Fremde
Means
Strange
Alien
Foreign
And
This was
You know
Arguably
The sort
Of
Stylistic
Hallmark
Of
Brecht
That
After he
Stopped
Using the
Term
Epic
Theater
He
He
Took
Up
The mantle
Theater
Of
Alienation
And
His
Plays
There
He
Kind of
Fits
Into
The same
Category
Of
Things
That
Are
Fascinating
But
I
Don't
Always
Like
Them
Because
The point
Of
The play
Is
Rarely
The main
Action
Of
The play
If you
Read him
As a
Traditional
Playwright
And you
Were looking
For
Character
Development
And theme
And emotional
Depth
And you
Know
Resonance
In this
Modern
World
You might
Not get
Very much
The entire
Point of
Brecht
Is
Taking
All that
Stuff
And
Fucking
Rubbishing
It
By
Throwing
In
Events
Characters
Dialogue
Whatever
That remind
You
While you're
Watching
The play
This is
A play
This is
Not
Real
We are
Doing
Something
Fake
Right
Now
And you
Were having
Real
Feelings
Over
Fake
Things
And
Maybe
You should
Think about
That in
Terms of
Your response
To say
Politics
Or
History
Or
Advertising
Maybe
You should
Start
Examining
How
How many
Other
Fake
Things
Lead to
Your real
Emotional
Investment
And
In a
Lot of
Cases
That was
Sort of
How
Bowie
Used
Himself
And I
Mentioned
That mid
And late
70s
Band
Because
If you
Look up
The guys
Who were
On
Station
To
Station
Low
Heroes
Most of
Them
Not all
They were
Mostly
From
An
American
R&B
Soul
Funk
Background
And
Obviously
That made
Sense
For
Young
Americans
But
What
Fascinates
Me
Is
That he
He
Kept
Those
Guys
As he
Moved
Into
This
Unclassifiable
Kind of
Music
That
It
Drew
Heavily
From
Soul
And
Funk
Still
But
It
Also
Had
This
Very
Icy
German
Krautrock
Kind of
Veneer
Drawn from
Kraftwerk
And
Tangerine
Dream
And
Can
And
Then
That
Was
Combined
With
A
Sort
Of
You
Can't
Call him
Prog
Rock
The way
You
Would
Say
That
About
Early
Genesis
Or
Whatever
But
The
Ambition
Both
Musically
And
In
In
Terms
Of
The
Scale
Of
What
A
Record
Was
Looking
To
Incorporate
That
Ambition
Was
You
Know
Very
Close
To
Or
In
Many
Times
Exceeding
The
Ambition
Of
The
Prog
Rock
Bands
Of
The
Time
I
Wonder
Sometimes
Even
If
Bowie
Did
That
In
The
Middle
And
Late
70s
Because
By
That
Time
Prog
Rock
Itself
Had
Been
Pretty
Well
Played
Out
You
Know
Most
Of
The
Real
Masterpieces
Of
That
Were
Created
In
The
Early
And
Mid
70s
And
I
Sort
Of
Wonder
If
He
Was
Letting
All
Of
That
Pass
By
So
That
Then
He
Could
Redefine
The
Idea
Of
Progressive
Rock
Or
Experimental
Rock
Although
We
Also
Have
To
Bear
In
Mind
Speaking
Of
Rock
In
The
Young
Americans
And
Station
To
Station
Era
Bowie
Was
Living
On
A
Diet
Of
Cocaine
Milk
And
White
Pepper
So
You
Know
I'm
Guessing
There
Are
A
Lot
Of
Spur
Of
The
Moment
Sort
Of
Decisions
But
My
Point
Is
That
If
You
Were
Going
To
Make
You
Know
What
By
Take
The
First
Side
Of
Heroes
By
Late
70s
Standards
That's
Largely
A
Hard
Rock
You
Know
Five
Tracks
Or
Whatever
It
Is
And
If
He
Had
Been
You
Know
Any
Number
Of
Other
Solo
Artists
He
Might
Have
Gotten
You
Know
The
Guys
From
Fucking
Thin
Lizzy
You
Know
He
Might
Have
Gotten
Scott
Gorham
And
Gary
Moore
In
There
Or
He
Could
Have
Gotten
You
Know
Tony
Iami
And
Geezer
Butler
And
Bill
Ward
Or
Guys
From
Led
Zeppelin
Although
He
Wouldn't
Have
Done
That
Because
He
Very
Correctly
Hated
And
Was
Terrified
By
Jimmy
Page
Which
I
Can
Tell
You
Some
Grim
Stories
About
That
Were
Absolutely
Expert
In
You
Know
The
The
The
Current
Wave
The
Most
Up-to-date
Forms
Of
Black
American
Pop
Music
You
Know
The
Post
Motown
Years
Going
Through
James
Brown
And
Into
Funk
And
Soul
And
Especially
Philadelphia
Soul
You
Know
The
La
La
Means
I
Love
You
The
Delphonics
And
Then
You
Know
That
That
Too
Was
Taken
By
Early
Hall
And
Oates
Rich
Girl
And
Shit
Like
That
And
He
Took
These
At
Heart
Soul
Musicians
And
Gave
Them
These
Roles
Playing
Stuff
That
Was
Loud
Dissonant
Repetitive
And
In
Terms
Of
You
Know
Affect
In
Terms
Of
Emotional
Temperature
A
Lot
Of
The
Time
Really
Really
Cold
And
There
Are
Certain
Favorite
Bowie
Tracks
Of
Mine
Where
The
Entire
Interest
Of
The
Song
Is
In
The
Desperate
Emotional
Clash
Between
The
Music
And
The
Lyrics
Word
On
A
Wing
From
Station
To
Station
Is
A
Perfect
Example
That
You
Know
With
Anybody
Else
Singing
That
Would
Sound
Like
Kind
Of
A
Smooth
Philly
Soul
Track
With
A
Little
Bit
Of
Rock
Guitar
Solo
On
It
And
Bowie
As
The
Singer
Counterposes
Himself
To
The
Smooth
Self
Assurance
Of
The
Lyrics
With
The
Most
Desperate
Strained
Lyric
And
Performance
About
How
Horribly
He
Needs
To
Believe
In
Something
How
Horribly
He
Needs
Something
To
Connect
To
Something
To
Feel
Like
He
Is
More
Down
To
Any
Sort
Of
Foundation
And
He's
Losing
It
You
Know
That
Song
Is
If
You
Read
It
On
Paper
It's
About
Believing
In
God
Right
That's
Not
What
It's
About
In
The
Performance
The
Performance
Is
About
Desperately
Trying
To
Force
Yourself
To
Believe
In
God
And
The
All-Time
Expert
Of
That
Kind
Of
Thing
Even
On
The
Same
Album
You
Flip
Sides
Right
I
Believe
Word
On
A
Wing
Is
The
Last
Song
On
Side
One
Is
Station
To
Station
The
Last
Song
On
Side
Two
Is
Wild
Is
The
Wind
The
Show
Tune
Made
Famous
By
Nina
Simone
And
Johnny
Mathis
And
This
Is
A
Song
Where
The
Lyric
Is
All
About
You
Know
These
Passionate
And
Instead
In
This
One
Instead
Of
Having
The
Band
Be
Kind
Of
You
Know
Smooth
And
Warm
And
Him
Being
Sort
Of
Desperate
And
Shrieking
Now
The
Band
Is
Playing
It
Very
Sort
Of
Even
Keeled
Not
Trying
To
Emphasize
Anything
Right
Just
There
Is
A
Numbness
To
That
Performance
By
Everyone
And
Then
You
Put
Bowie's
Vocal
In
There
And
He
Sounds
Like
He
Is
Singing
Live
Via
Satellite
He
Sounds
Like
I
Mean
That
That
Track
Kind
Of
Scares
Me
Sometimes
Because
That
Is
The
Voice
Of
The
Definitive
Cocaine
Zombie
You
Know
He's
Giving
All
These
Passionate
Protestations
And
It
Just
Sounds
Like
This
Is
A
Man
Who
Has
Never
Had
Any
Feelings
At
All
And
Even
The
You
Know
The
Somewhat
Going
For
The
Rafters
Show
Stopping
High
Notes
At
The
End
And
Everything
He
Doesn't
Sound
At
All
Like
He's
Doing
That
Out
Of
You
Know
Some
Explosion
Of
Inner
Turmoil
It
Sounds
Sounds
Like
He's
Just
Doing
It
To
Get
Through
The
Song
And
That
Sort
Of
Juxtaposition
Is
A
Huge
Part
Of
His
Expertise
And
You
Move
That
Stuff
Then
On
To
Lowe
And
Heroes
And
Lodger
And
There's
A
Reason
Nothing
Else
Sounds
Like
Those
Records
Because
They
Were
A
Product
Of
Bowie's
You
Life
At
The
Time
And
His
Musical
Fixations
All
The
Stuff
He
Was
Interested
In
And
Then
You
Combine
That
With
What
Is
Still
Basically
A
Black
American
R&B
Rhythm
Section
In
Dennis
Davis
And
George
Murray
And
Carlos
Alomar
And
Then
You
Add
To
The
Top
Of
That
The
Kind
Of
Vanguard
Of
European
Experimental
Rock
Robert
Fripp
And
Brian
Eno
You
Know
That
Nobody
Puts
Other
Intentionally
Cast
Matter
And
When I
First
Heard
The
Next
Day
In
2013
My
Main
Reaction
Was
Shock
That
Bowie
Had
Made
Another
Album
Because
The
The
Rumors
I
Heard
About
Him
From
The
People
Afore
Mentioned
Who
I
Don't
Want
To
Talk
About
Any
Of
Them
By
Name
But
People
Who
Were
Around
Him
At
Least
In
That
Period
Said
That
He
Appeared
Not
To
Be
Working
On
Any
Music
That
He
In
Fact
Appeared
Not
To
Be
Really
Concentrating
On
Any
One
Endeavor
At
All
And
That

believe for an instant. And so he then in reality contains some incredible shit, some of his best
work ever. They also contain quite a number of forgettable things and quite a number of things
that pursue an interesting idea, but kind of don't carry it off. The next day comes out 10 years
later, and it's almost the inverse of that. There are no failures on it. There are no mistakes or
abortive ideas at all. It's very solid all the way through, but there also, at first glance,
are not the kind of peaks you associate with him. Certainly there's, I don't think sonically,
well, maybe one exception, but mostly there's nothing from the next day that immediately
stands out as, oh, this is going to, this is the signature song. You know, this is the benchmark
for this album. This is the one he would be doing in concert if you were still doing concerts.
And so for those few years of listening to it, and I listened to it a lot because
anything by somebody like Bowie, I am going to give it a lot of chances precisely because I'm aware
how much the sort of ecology of mind that exists between me, the album, and the world that we're
both in can shift a whole lot. So I, you know, I listened to this over and over, and I was kind of
puzzled. Like, these are all, you know, good, solid guitar pop or guitar rock songs, whatever you want
to call them. But why, why come out of retirement just to make, yeah, here, here are my songs lately.
You know, here's what I've been doing. And I've said it before about other artists as well, but
particularly about Bowie, that you always have to remember the song is not just about the lyrics,
and it's not just about the performance. The song is also about the sound of the song.
He doesn't just haphazardly decide, you know, what if we made this one funky? No, no, no. If,
if there is something, you know, funk influenced on a Bowie album, it's because he is saying something
very specific about his relationship to that music and the way that music has been
codified and commodified. I mean, that's the, the entire thrust of young Americans, right?
And I don't know when it first was, maybe six months ago, maybe a year. I was listening to
The Next Day again, and it snapped, and I got it. And I, I realized, well, let me put this a bit out of
order. The album cover of The Next Day, if you've never seen it, it's, at first I thought it was
kind of a cheesy gimmick, and now I think it's brilliant. It is the album cover from Heroes,
you know, that I'm sure you've all seen it, the, him in a leather jacket kind of holding his,
his hands out and looking into a point in the middle distance. It's the Heroes album cover,
but with the word Heroes scratched out, and then a big white square over the middle of the cover,
and then inside of that, and this really nondescript, sans serif, Helvetica type font,
just The Next Day. And that struck me as, as, you know, a little bit of an attention getting gimmick
at first. But, of course, all these things develop over years, and I started thinking recently about
the relationship between Heroes and The Next Day. Why, you know, because he's had a lot of famous
album covers. Why that one? And to me, it comes back to the song Heroes, which I think is one of the
most misinterpreted songs ever written by anyone. You will notice if you, if you look closely at the
album, the lyrics, all that, the song is not Heroes. The song is, quote, Heroes, end quote. It's within
quotation marks in itself. And the, you know, we'll talk about an incredible act of matching
the sound to the song. Heroes is about the capacity for self-delusion, particularly in the crossover
between, like, the romantic personal realm and the, the geopolitical realm. Uh, it's about the way
that we have an incredible capacity to convince ourselves that whatever we're doing in our private
lives, whether that's being in love with someone or sleeping with someone's we're not in love with,
or the things we're buying, or the things we're not buying, uh, we have an incredible ability to
convince ourselves that that's doing something politically, which, hate to break it to you,
it's basically never doing anything politically. I mean, the, I can't even really call most shit
that's put out by, you know, movie studios and record labels and major publishers now. I can't call
it art because it's not, but, um, the media would be the word. And, uh, we have managed to convince,
not just ourselves, but the entire world that the most political thing you can do is consume the
correct media, which is just, when you have it laid out bare like that is one of the most
depressing ideas in human existence. That if, if we watch the anti-racist Barbie movie, uh,
somehow that'll improve, uh, the lives of black people, I guess, um, anti-racist Barbie is,
you know, chipping away at the, the, the legacy of the, you know, genocide of African slaves and the
fact that so many of their descendants still disproportionately live in horrifying situations
in large part because the dynastic wealth they would have built up over 400 years was taken
since they were slaves. It's, it's incredible how people do this over and over and over.
And on one hand, it's just purely mockable. It's purely risible, right? You can look at it. And I
often do with a lot of fucking contempt. And, you know, this is what Bowie is getting at and all this
stuff about, you know, kissing at the Berlin wall and the bombs flying above our heads, but we are
immune. They're not going to hit us. This, this absurd idea that like, you know, it's almost Nathan
Barley or something. It's like, dude, if I eat pussy on top of the Kremlin, the war in Ukraine is over.
Everybody will understand, you know, it's preposterous on the face of that. But then the song is not
merely condemnatory or contemptuous. The song is also an acknowledgement of the fact that for,
for pure reasons of self-preservation, we probably have to do this to some degree, because if we were
ever to confront in its full blinding terror, the absolute impotence that we have, the absolute
inability we have to change even something small and simple about a nation that supposedly belongs
to us. If you look that right in the face, there are really only, I would say, two major responses
and, and people alternate between them. And one of them is a very reasonable, you know, cynicism to the
point of nihilism. And the other one is managing to convince yourself that somehow the affairs of your
private life are having, you know, an outsized impact on the affairs of the world. And, um, there's a
fascinating technical thing about the song heroes that I would say, unless, unless you're a dedicated
Bowie fan already, you've probably never heard the whole song because the version they always play on
the radio and in TV shows, and even sometimes at fucking like sporting events is the single edit,
which is about two minutes and two or three verses shorter than the real one. And I think there's a
reason for that. Uh, not just because the shorter one is easier to get on the radio, but because it's
the last few verses that really make clear what this song is about. So, you know, people love chanting
along to, we can be heroes just for one day. And yet the, uh, last, I think it's the last kind of
pre-chorus bridge section in heroes. Uh, the lyric is we're nothing and nothing will help us. Maybe
you're liars, so we better not stay, but we can be heroes just for one day. It is this, this, you know,
crushed consciousness careening between like, we're completely full of shit. None of this matters.
You would do well to get away from us. We are only going to bring fucking grief into the world.
But on the other hand, maybe if I, I take this really hot girl I met at a club the other night
and, and we like, I don't know, we make out against the Berlin wall. Uh, maybe that'll change the world
because what other fucking choice do you have? It's, you know, not many people can live in the,
uh, the permanent despair that, that accrues from, uh, knowing you can't change much, right?
So this is the whole essence of heroes, the song and the album. And I begin to think about this
as it relates to the next day, because the next day, of course, Bowie could have done that
with any of his famous album covers, could have put the white square and the new name on there.
So why that one? And I think it's because the next day is in many ways, a sequel to heroes,
the, uh, you know, the rock half of heroes. So, uh, uh, Oh God, what is the name of the first,
uh, beauty and the beast and, uh, the song heroes and sons of the silent age and blackout.
And what is the one I'm embarrassing? Uh, uh, Joe the lion, a lot of, uh, a lot of the next day
sounds kind of like a continuation of that. But now by making that the update to heroes, a, uh,
an album that is about utter self delusion, but also, um, perhaps the idea that it's only that
self delusion keeping us alive. Well, this is a sequel, uh, about how the self delusion didn't
keep us alive. It actually made things worse. Um, and the, the quote that I've been thinking of,
um, in reference to this album for a long time now is, uh, something that was written by
Hugh Kenner, the, the, uh, modernist literary scholar who the guy had a, um, somewhat unsavory,
uh, life and set of politics and shit. Uh, I actually don't know that much about it, but,
uh, you know, mid century Catholic intellectual, like, you know, the type, you know, we're on our
point now, ducky. Uh, but he was nonetheless, I think the, the literary critic of the last century
with the most insight into modernism. And he said something about Ulysses, James Joyce's Ulysses at
one point, uh, that if you want to understand this book, just think about it as a series of
necropolises, or I guess the plural would be necropolies. Think of it as a compilation of
dead cities. And these cities are not only, you know, literally Dublin, but language, social custom,
economics, family expectation, religion, every sort of right and ritual, uh, whether it's explicitly
religious or civic. This is, uh, Ulysses is a book about everybody being trapped in his or her own
private necropolis and trying to, trying to fight out of it with only the tools the necropolis has
given them, trying to turn their lives, their country into something else. But their only means
for doing so are all the dead languages, all the dead forms, all the dead customs and, and dead
political dynasties and fealties and enmities. Those are the only tools they've got to work with.
It's about people alive who are buried under stratum after stratum of dead cities. And I think that is
quite a fair summary of the next day too, it is an album about the, the absolute paralysis of being frozen
within these, these frames of reference, which by themselves prevent you ever from leaving. And I think, um,
it was a concept I'm kind of messing around with. Uh, I talked last time about the, you know, spiral theory of
history, which apparently a linen said something like that too. I didn't know that. Um, and what I'm
thinking of, of calling it, um, I, I, I thought first about the idea of what you might call inverse
apocalypticism that, um, the apocalypse happens over and over and over, uh, just on wider and wider scales
and actually, uh, far from reducing things to zero, every, every, uh, apocalypse assures that the next
one will be even larger. And there is something to that. And, and maybe that's a separate concept,
but the, the word that is occurring to me now is transurrection rather than resurrection,
insurrection, insurrection. It's transurrection. It is being brought back to life only for that life
to be trapped by the same fucking things happening over and over and over. You die and are reborn a
million times in a lifetime. And every time you wake up from death, you are even more trapped than you
were before. And that I think is the core of the next day. The reason it's called the next day, because,
you know, the apocalyptic event happens, the epoch changing, uh, occurrence, uh, the thing that is
supposed to, even if it's terrible, it's supposed to free you from the brackets of the world as you know it,
right? And then there's the next day and the next and another day, it all comes back and it usually
comes back meaner and worse than before. And, uh, I can't go through just for time's sake, every
reference in every song, but I do think it, it bears a semi-chronological reading because the next day
itself, the song that starts it off, you know, very much in the heroes, scary monsters mold. And it's
not about any one specific, uh, sort of form of, of religious violence and the kind of perversion
that gets turned into hagiography, you know, listen to the horrors he tells her, he fashions paper dolls,
uh, paper sculptures of them. The, the, uh, they, they, uh, work with Satan while they dress like the
saints, you know, bring him to the feet of the purple headed priest. And then I think that the
clear, um, the clear little diptych in the whole thing, uh, first they gave you everything that you
want, then they take back everything that you have. The, the song is, it's unspecific in terms of
these, you know, reference to priests and religious orgies and, and the violence of, you know, sainthood
and the non-specificity of it is part of the point because you could play that song to 10 people
who, you know, had some, some degree of knowledge of, let's say, you know, Christian civilization from,
uh, the Holy Roman empire until now. And every one of them could make a good argument that it is about
a different specific instance. And that's the point. It's about all of them and it keeps fucking
happening. It's a dead city. We live inside. And there is this, this, uh, element of what I'm
calling transurrection that not only, uh, does death get worse every time you're reborn, but death
in many ways also gets subtler and harder to see. And, and the outline that, you know, Bowie is giving us
here, uh, is of a fairly flagrant kind of, you know, religious abuse of sexual and, and military
power, right? Well, all of that is still happening. Just the problem is, uh, the people doing it
aren't parading down the streets in purple cloaks anymore with, you know, slave women carrying bowls
of holy water behind them because at least you knew who they were. You knew who was doing it
and you could convince yourself whether it's true or not that getting rid of them would stop the
problem. And now, uh, power and its abuses are so decentralized. It's not exactly the right word
because there are of course centers, but are so fractalized, are so micro and macrocosmic, repeating
themselves on every level that there, there is no one person you could kill to stop anything. There is no
one corporation or even government you could destroy to stop all of this. There, there, there is no longer
a, a, a locus for the feeling that you have some power to do anything but die and then transurrect
into a world where death has become even more hideous. And, and the, the image he gives in the chorus,
you know, here I am not quite dying. My body left to rot in a hollow tree. The branch is throwing
shallows on the, the branch is throwing shadows on the gallows for me and the next day and the next
and another day. And it's that part at the end that is worse, you know, left to die inside a hollow
tree, you know, seeing the fucking rope in the branches. Well, at least you know what's going on
there, right? At least these are pretty clear terms. And this, this man who is, you know, condemned to
death, even though you would think a man condemned to death, who knows perfectly well how he's going
to die. Uh, that would be the end of, of future despair for him. No, what the guy is thinking of
in the fucking tree is, and the next day and the next and another day, this is going to keep fucking
going. This is going to happen over and over. And every time it'll get harder for people to discern.
It'll get harder to attack. It'll get harder to recognize. It will worm its way under my skin,
even worse. And so you can think, uh, what a horrible situation to be under the, you know,
under the obvious oppression of an obvious ruling class. And yeah, that, that is horrible.
It's not any less horrible when instead of that kind of direct hierarchical oppression,
you are now oppressed internally by the things you have absorbed from the ruling class. They
managed to convince you they're, they're not so different and, and they can fucking get inside
you and rewire you. And you end up, you know, in this transurrected world in which everything
that was once external and violent, but identifiable is now part of your own neurological
equipment. And that in, in miniature is, is kind of what the whole record is about. Um,
and I, as I say earlier, I, uh, I could absolutely do a, a long read of, of every song on this album,
but I want to hit what to me are a, uh, a few obvious high points. And, uh, if, if in the comments
or something, you have a question about another song, uh, feel free to ask it. So from that point,
from the, you know, the opening statement, the next thing I will go to is the stars are out tonight.
One of the greatest singles Bowie ever released, you know, I'm not, I'm not putting it up with,
with all the songs he ever wrote, but as a three minute song that does what it's supposed to do in
three minutes, Jesus, what a piece of writing. And, um, virtually the entire thing is two chords.
There, there's almost no musical change in terms of what people are playing. The musical change all comes
in layers. It's, it's not what people are playing. It's how many people are playing it.
And I think this is important and a reason I hope to make clear in a second. So if any of you have
ever heard me, uh, use the expression like on the main line or plugged into the third rail,
something like that, that is my way of saying that someone I respect, someone I follow makes or says
something that corresponds almost exactly to something I have been privately thinking.
And, and that moment of understanding, holy shit, me and this guy are plugged into the same thing.
Uh, that is what I refer to as, as the main line or the third rail. And the stars are out tonight.
I, that goddamn song, um, I had already formulated, I think even written about the, the basic ideas of
what I've talked about in terms of the iconosphere. Uh, but if I hadn't, you could pretty much get what
you needed to know from the stars are out tonight by David Bowie, because the song is this,
this sort of tripartite, not, not hierarchical, but stratified system in which he is referring to,
you know, stars as in famous people, he is referring to stars as in, you know, actual constellations.
And then by, uh, by metonymy, he is referring to, uh, pagan gods, pre-Christian gods, basically.
And on the surface, the, the song is about how we all loathe and resent and mock famous people
and often live for their downfall. But we're also terribly scared of the idea that at some point
there might not be any celebrities at some point things might get evened out too much.
And we don't really want that, right? Because this is the iconospheric thing. Your life, my life,
the sort of lives where we walk into the other room to sharpen a pencil and have to get a new box
of Kleenex for the bathroom. That's not the real world. That's not life. That's not real life.
In the same way, what the celebrities are actually doing in their lives, all the daily details of
being some fucking famous actor, whatever, that's not the real world either. The real world exists
in between us. It is what we imagine fame is like. It, it, it is our, our, uh, semi-inculcated
and semi, you know, autopoietic vision of the, the part of reality where people can actually change
things, where people actually matter, where people have merged themselves with some sort of
tide of history, as Lee Harvey Oswald put it. Um, that's, what's real. It's not me. It's not the
celebrity. It's what I think about the celebrity. And so, uh, so we're, we're actually horrified by the
idea that celebrity as such could disappear. And like Bowie sings, uh, you know, their jealousy
spilling down, but stars must stick together. We will never be rid of these stars. And I hope they
live forever. Those two lines back and forth got me fucking shivering. And then immediately after that,
uh, they hear referring to stars because they know just what we do, how we toss and turn at night
and they're waiting to make their moves on us. The stars are out tonight. The, the, as I say,
you know, the celebrity life isn't real too. It's, it's the interface zone. It's, it's the DMZ between
us. Right. And so in the same way that, uh, we are obsessive about the imaginary world, the iconosphere
in which, uh, we think, you know, reality, history, the news, the important stuff is happening.
And the same way we're obsessed with that, the people on top, or at least theoretically on top,
are obsessed with us because they have now left the real world. They have now left any kind of
normalcy. And in order to do the things that they hope will, uh, come off as relatable,
they need to vampirize all of our lives. They need to pretend to have the problems we do.
They need to try to make themselves look normal because only if they are, you know, within a certain
distance of us, can we still consider them near enough to be worth paying attention to,
you know, the very, very richest people on earth, uh, are, are largely not people that, um, anyone
spends a lot of time thinking about, except maybe fucking Elon Musk, although that's monopoly money.
Uh, the point is, it's not just about, you know, economic and material power. It's about the feeling
that you somehow understand the way this celebrity has risen from the mundanity of our fake world
to the real reality of the world of icons. And you fixate on that celebrity, both as a, a votive icon,
a saint, you know, something haeographical, uh, but also hoping for their destruction and, and not
just hoping for their destruction in terms of, oh, I hope they, you know, get arrested and aren't in
movies anymore or whatever. No, no way more than that. Because as I've, as I've discussed at length in,
in those early iconosphere episodes, what's really scary about, uh, trying to turn people into
iconography is that an icon does two very specific things. Number one, it stands in front of you,
apparently saying something, you know, it is charged with meaning you, you know, it wouldn't be there
in, unless it were completely saturated with, you know, neurological signal gain, if it wasn't
signifying. But the other thing an icon does is refuse to talk. They're silent. They're not going to tell you.
And on the large and the small scale, uh, when you convert a person into a constellation in the iconosphere,
you are consciously or not wishing a great violence upon them. And, and when I say that,
I'm talking about anything from a hugely famous person to, you know, the girl at the coffee shop or,
you know, the guy you see at shows or whatever, and, and come to think about as, you know, a, a resident
of this special zone where reality really happens. Because if an icon promises meaning, but refuses to
disclose meaning, then we will assign meaning to it. And when those inevitably unstable meanings
start to flake and crack and peel, because all meanings are unstable, our reaction is usually
violence against the icon. Whether it's the, you know, a shame disavowal of having been some
celebrity's fan or having voted for some politician. Um, it, it can, it can proceed in any number of ways
on that level. It can also be very literal violence. When you think of, of how much physical violence in
this country is performed by men upon women, because those women in one way or another have ceased,
to, to, to satisfy the requirements of the icon. Right. And it was realizing this, that, that really
completely rewired my understanding of how something like gender works in general, but especially in this
country, because I saw people all around me, not really so much being interested in, you know, a girl
because she's funny or, or, or cute or intelligent, whatever. It's because this girl embodies
iconographic qualities to them. This girl stands as a totem for everything about the world of the real
lucky people, the people who get to live real life, you know, and, and this girl in the male
consciousness becomes my access. She, if I can raise myself to the level of the icon, she can give me
the key to real reality where I don't feel like a pointless fucking loser whose life means nothing
and who will be forgotten immediately after he dies. And in fact, probably before. And that of course
is a completely insane thing to do to a woman to, I mean, to do to anybody, but it's much more common
with women here, uh, to overload these women with, with all the intense, but also non-specific meaning
with which an icon is, is saturated. Right. And then when they somehow fail to live up to their statuses,
the iconography, the response of, uh, disappointment by men often comes in the form of violence. Uh,
uh, certainly there's plenty of, you know, uh, linguistic, emotional, behavioral violence to it,
but there's also just a lot of actual violent violence. There's also, you know, a lot of, uh, I mean,
fuck, I don't want to make this sound like a Mexican thing. I don't want it to be specific to Mexico
because I mean, the drug trade in Mexico is, you know, the CIA, DEA, there's, they're sitting on top
of that. None of that shit would happen if they didn't want it to, but the, the, the femicides in
Juarez, the thousands and thousands of women showing up dead and no one seems to care. Um, sure.
Some of those are probably just strict, cold blooded, pragmatic, you know, narco hits,
but I am willing to bet that a lot of them are women who were venerated and iconographied,
iconized, whatever, by men who then somehow failed to give those men the sense that yes,
I'm granting you the key to real reality where you're going to be a real person now.
And that could be because, you know, those women just had no interest in those men or because they
had interest in some other man or because they had interest in, you know, no men at all,
or even more insidiously, it could be because they did, uh, have interest in this man, right?
They did somewhere between, you know, enthusiastic interest and acquiescence,
somewhere on that scale, they were willing to engage in what they thought was a relationship
with a male human being.
And it wasn't, it was a relationship between a male human being and the icon he had made
of this woman.
And when she fails in her status as icon, the reaction is often destruction and often very
literal physical destruction.
Uh, I, I just cannot think of all those women's corpses fucking maimed on the sides of highways
and shit in Sonora and Chihuahua and, and not think about this.
And, and, and even more horribly that this, the, the way that the woman quote unquote fails
in her iconographic status is often, in fact, by giving the man what he wants, you know,
some, some resentful, lonely guy who has been taught fucked up ways to deal with himself,
uh, fixates on this girl, makes her into a, you know, a religious figure.
And again, not to be specifically Mexican about it, but to be, in my case, Irish Catholic about it.
We are taught to do this with the Virgin Mary.
We are literally taught to do this.
And then he gets access, right?
And then the access falls short of his expectations.
You know, he fucks this girl or whatever, and his whole life doesn't change.
He doesn't feel like a better or more real person.
He feels like himself.
And in a way feels even worse because now he's not only been disappointed, now he lost
the icon.
Now he, he broke the key he thought was going to open up the real world for him.
And so the, the, the violence of acceptance, or I should say violence in response to acceptance
is often even more violent than violence in response to denial.
And, and, and, and it is, you know, the virgin whore double bind that, I mean, as, as literally
as you can imagine this, this was how I was taught to think of women.
This is, I had, uh, what they called theology classes on this in an all male high school.
I was taught very explicitly that, um, most women are whores and the few who aren't are
the Virgin Mary.
Uh, so you want to be going after the Virgin Mary, right?
The problem is as soon as the Virgin Mary gets with you, uh, she's a whore.
She, she stopped being the Virgin Mary, right?
And so, uh, your destiny is to leave in your wake a trail of crumpled fake virgins who turned
out to be whores.
I mean, it was the language, uh, in, in which this was pounded into my head when I was 14.
I'm not really exaggerating it.
And I think it's, it's an astonishing feat on Bowie's part to see the tripartite motion
of this, how that same idea of, of something being manufactured iconography that promises
you, uh, access to the real reality.
You both desperately want and love it and you desperately hate it for either not being
yours or for becoming yours.
There's no good way out of it.
And, you know, I'm sure this, this iconographic or iconospheric dynamic takes place between,
you know, groups of people other than straight men and straight women, whatever.
But in, in terms of the, uh, the larger demographics and the people who commit most of the violence,
it's, it's mostly straight men against straight women.
It's, you know, it's the psychology of it is not necessarily delimited to straight men,
but that's who's doing most of the killing.
So you kind of got to focus on them.
And that is layered over with the idea of, you know, pagan gods that in the same way,
same way, these are, uh, well, I don't want to get into my whole personal theory of paganism
here, but basically to cut it short, I don't believe that, that any sort of pre, pre monotheistic
pagan animist system really thought that there were like personified gods walking around the
earth.
The gods were names for durable patterns in nature, for cycles that we had observed in
the world.
And in that same moment, as with the, the virgin horror dichotomy, you worship and adore these
powers of the cosmos.
You know, the, these, these universal sort of turbines, these cloud chambers for being
able to map the energy transfers of the universe.
You also want to kill them because, uh, if you can kill them, who knows, you might become
one of them.
And even if you don't become one of them, you have just proven to yourself that you can kill
something you thought you had no power over.
And then above that, the literal stars, both in terms of, you know, astronomy in the conventional
sense and astrological alignment, but also the literal actual stars, the things that are
the, um, the, the sort of macro scale biological structure of the universe.
The universe is, is an organism made of stars basically.
So these things that are presenting to us, uh, both, both a spectacle of infinite distance
and of infinite closeness, because what they do, and I'm not even talking about astrology here.
I'm just talking about actual, you know, cosmology.
What they do, how they live and die has incalculable impact on, on what your life is.
And for that matter, if your life is, you know, all this shit around us is a, the earth itself,
any planet is a necropolis of dead stars that have been transmuted into something else.
They are both the furthest thing from us and the closest thing to us.
And I think obviously Bowie has had a star thing for many decades.
And, you know, I understand I do too.
I think it's very significant that Black Star was his final album after this.
The, the idea, as I've broadly sketched it elsewhere, of, of trying to take vengeance upon the stars,
you know, as Wyndham Lewis put it, enemy of the stars.
And Wyndham Lewis said some, you know, real hateful, bigoted shit, but everybody should read
enemy of the stars.
His, is kind of, it's not really a play.
It's, it's sort of a novella that's an idea for a play.
Um, first, just because it's incredible.
And second, because it will give you some real sharp and often real bleak insights into the,
the modernist mind, right?
Um, the, the enemy of the star, uh, who wishes to destroy the star can't really do that on a
practical scale right now, can we?
So instead, what we do is collaborate with the Hathonic powers of the underground, collaborate
with that other transmutation, right?
Because there is the alchemy of all the dead stars becoming this world.
And then there is the alchemy of all the dead stuff in this world becoming fossil fuel.
And fossil fuel oil in particular, as I've mentioned, Reza Negarestani, uh, writes about
at length in Cyclonopedia.
Oil is the death of earthly things versus the death of cosmic things.
And though we can't kill the star, what we can do is make ourselves into the new black star,
into the counter star.
We can outshine them by being black instead of bright.
And our vector for doing that so often is, is petroleum based technology and the wars that
are fought over it.
So that eventually through, through both war and climate change, we will convert our earth
into the black star and thus finally claim dominion over all of these cosmological forces
that we've never been able to contact in, in, no, we're in contact with them all the time.
We've never been able to influence is what I'm saying here.
Uh, God damn that song.
You see what I mean?
I take it that I could go on at length about any of these songs, but I want to choose a couple
more that I find particularly fascinating.
One of those is Valentine's Day.
And once you have the idea as, uh, the idea of this album, like Ulysses, as a series of
necropolises, a series of dead things we can't escape.
And every time we transurrect ourselves into what seems like an escape, things have actually
gotten exponentially worse.
Uh, Valentine's Day makes a whole lot of sense.
Because the song is quite plainly about a school shooter.
Um, it's about a kid coming to school with a gun and killing the people who have tormented
him.
And if you watch the video for, uh, for Valentine's Day, it's Bowie playing alone in, in a big
empty building.
And at first when I saw it, I thought this seems like kind of just a lazy standard guy
plays guitar in a building video.
Why would Bowie do this?
And then I realized from the architecture of the building and the state of disrepair, oh,
this is the school where the shooting happened.
And I would encourage anyone to watch that video after this.
Bowie is in the rubble of the school.
They had to shut down because of a mass murder.
And Bowie does something really horrifyingly brilliant with the music here.
Because, you know, school shootings, I don't know about you youngins, but for me, in terms
of like music and shit, those have been associated with, you know, Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson,
KMFDM ever since I was a kid.
And I realized people don't listen to most of that shit anymore, but that's still the association.
And Bowie draws the music, uh, for Valentine's Day from two, like, horrifyingly genius sources.
One of them is that it has basically the same chord changes as any number of 50s and 60s doo-woppy love songs.
Like, um, The End of Happiness is a Warm Gun, for example.
Uh, Bowie has taken this music that has, for generations, been associated with things like
high school proms, high school dances, the homecoming game, the, the things that were supposed
to be, you know, the signal marker of your major life events while you're in high school, right?
And now he has applied this music to a school shooting because he has realized, hey, now
if you're a high school student, especially in America, the question is not, will the girl
go to prom with you?
The question is not, oh, are you alone and pathetic at the homecoming dance?
The question is, how long till someone brings a gun?
Because someone is going to bring a gun.
Eventually, given time and given the, uh, complete fucking legal impotence of anyone who's supposed
to be doing anything about this, someone will bring a gun to every school in this country.
And now, your high school life, your high school, you know, uh, supposed psychic growth is not
oriented around, oh, you know, can I meet these goals by this time?
It's oriented around how long until I have to realize, uh, that I'm in a building with somebody
with a gun and I have to decide whether to hide or to run or to try to fight him and save other
people.
And how long till this is happening?
And I realized the fucking pig cops who have a billion dollars worth of tactical gear are
just standing outside watching this happen because they're not trying to get shot for a fucking,
you know, 12th grader.
That, that, that is now the, the defining moment of your adolescence is when the school shooting
happens.
And to marry that to this very stereotypical kind of fifties, early sixties love song music
is, is, is fucking incredible.
And the other thing musically you will notice about this song is that if you play, uh, pay
real close attention, the guy who plays the lead guitar on this track is named Earl Slick.
And Earl Slick is a great guitar player who has been with Bowie on and off quite a few times.
He was originally the lead guitar player for the, uh, young American station to station band.
And, you know, you will be familiar with his incredible solo from station to station and wild
on a wing or word on a wing, pardon me.
And, um, the riff from golden years, all that stuff is, is Earl Slick.
And then he came back for the heathen and reality, uh, era.
He was Bowie's lead guitarist when I saw Bowie live and he put on one of the great lead guitar
performances I've ever seen.
And, uh, then he's on the next day for just a couple of songs.
And one of them is Valentine's day.
And I wondered the first time I saw the credits, why, why Slick on this?
I mean, he sounds great, you know, but you could get, you can get a lot of people to play
this.
And I realized it's because not only are the chord changes almost identical to a fifties love
song, but the little, the little licks, the little improvised pattern things that, uh,
Earl Slick is playing in between the vocals are drawn almost note for note from the song
Waterloo Sunset by the Kinks.
And I hope to God, you know, that song already, but, uh, if you don't, it's, it's a very kink
song.
It's the kink song.
It's the Ray Davies song.
That's, uh, fantasizing about seeing, uh, Terrence Stamp and Julie Christie out, out on the town,
you know, London, uh, weekend meeting at the tube station.
And it's all super romantic and they're young and sexy and their whole lives are ahead of
them.
Um, and then the narrator, the Ray Davies guy, uh, watching all this from his window and
thinking, uh, I, I wish that was my life.
I wish I lived in the real world that they lived in, you know, the whole iconosphere thing
again.
Um, but you know, as long as, as long as I can watch them do it, it's okay that I can't do
it myself.
You know, Ray Davies is great theme as a songwriter, arguably is resignation.
It's, it's about trying to convince yourself that, uh, it's okay.
Your heart is broken.
Now update that to 2013.
Now take the song being about, you know, any two celebrities, any famous celebrity couple
and think of the viewer who is no longer, you know, looking out through his window at a
waterloo sunset, who's seeing this shit online.
How do you relate?
How do you relate to them now?
Do you just sit there and say, oh, well, you know, as long as I can watch the beautiful
people, I am okay.
Not most people, but most people do is either get fanatically defensive of them or fanatically,
hateful of them or most to the point of all kill them or try to kill one of them.
And it just by adding those couple little guitar riffs from, uh, Waterloo Sunset into this song,
Earl Slick via David Bowie is suggesting this change in the nature of the iconosphere from
1966 to now that back then they were at an arm's length and you just tried to feel lucky to see
them.
Now they're everywhere and you're watching everywhere and your ultimate relationship to them would
be not to watch them, not even to become them, but to kill them, to end the kind of life
that you are not allowed to have essentially.
And, um, let's see.
I, I, I think it's important to you to talk in terms of a dyad about the last two songs on
the next day as a sort of summary.
Um, you feel so lonely.
You could die and heat and you feel so lonely.
You could die is, um, musically it's very patterned upon five years.
The, the first song from a Ziggy Stardust and it even directly reprises the Ziggy Stardust
opening drum beat at the end.
And the song is clearly about an intelligence operative from a war or conflict or nation
or security situation that no longer exists.
And I think almost everyone who's talked about this has gotten it wrong because they think
this is a, it's like, oh, it's yeah, it's a revenge song against Cold War spies, you know,
mocking them and saying, you know, they're left completely alone in the world.
And isn't it better to have been on the right side than to be a fucking dirty saboteur.
And if you read the lyrics in the most superficial way possible, yeah, sure.
I, I, that adds up.
If you read any deeper and you listen to the performance, it is clearly the opposite.
It is about, again, someone in the audience, someone watching TV,
someone at his computer who is seeing these, you know, spies of, of, uh, of a collapsed war
or of a, a missing nation state and desperately trying to tell himself,
yeah, I bet you guys fucking hate yourselves.
I bet you're so lonely you could die.
And the undertone of the entire thing is clearly, please, I need you to be so lonely.
You could die.
Because if I know you're still out there and still doing what you do,
and you didn't feel anything about that, I'm going to feel so lonely.
I could die.
Because I, I wasn't, I wasn't there doing any of that.
And yet, I feel so much worse than you do.
And that's, I mean, it's just palpable through the song and Bowie's delivery.
It's not as easy a song to rip lyrics from because, um, it's so much in the way he sings it.
But, um, uh, when he is, he's fantasizing about, uh, hearing this spy hang himself
in a room next to him at a hotel or whatever, he says, uh, I can hear you falling.
I hear you moaning in your room.
Oh, see if I care.
Oh, please God, make it soon.
That's the song right there.
This fantasy of, you know, a man riven with regret, killing himself to prove you right.
To prove that, you know, your moral stance toward all this was the correct one.
And you have nothing to apologize for.
Uh, imagining you can hear the guy choking to death and trying to brush it off with,
see if I care.
Like, yeah, fuck you.
You're not even a person who, you know, who would care if you die.
And then right then, please God, make it soon.
Like, oh Christ, please.
Now that, and I think the cold war is the obvious example.
Now that I know all these things are out there, now that more and more information is available,
more than, than ever about the globe spanning machinations of the security state and particularly
the American one with which of course the British was very affiliated.
Um, I know all these people are out there pursuing horrific agendas they will never be caught for
and leading wonderful lives because of it.
Subjectively wonderful.
I can't go on knowing that.
I can't live knowing that the world is surrounded with that all around me.
So instead, I have to convince myself that these people are self-loathing to the point of suicide
because if they're not, I am.
And I think there is a beautifully conveyed desperation in the, uh, the excerpt from the song
I put at the beginning of the episode that it's not just, uh, you feel so lonely you could die.
The phrase, it is, as it is actually repeated in the song, it's,
I bet you feel so lonely you could die, die, die, die.
I hope you feel so lonely you could die, die, die, die.
You feel so lonely you could die, die, die, die.
You don't repeat something that much when you're confident about it.
That is not the sound of a confident declaration.
That is someone thinking, I have to keep saying this until it's true.
I have to keep saying this until it's true.
The song, I think, is with a lot of, a lot of the songs on the next day.
And I would be happy to talk more about them in another show, uh, is the exact inverse of what
critics assumed it to be.
And that, that track, you know, that is ostensibly about, you know, the crumbling regimes of the post-cold war era,
and is actually about our inability to live with knowledge of that, leads into Heat.
Heat, uh, one of the stranger songs in latter-day Bowie's catalog.
And I've talked about Scott Walker on this show before.
If you've ever heard any Scott Walker, you know Heat is an homage to Scott Walker.
They, he and Bowie were mutual influences.
I think they dated the same girl at the same time once.
And, uh, if you, if you want to understand the relationship between something like Heat and him,
go out and listen to the albums, uh, Climate of Hunter and Tilt.
And that'll explain it for you.
And this begins, Heat begins with an illusion that, um, I had to have someone explain to me.
I, I, of course, I know who Yukio Mishima is, uh, but I've always found his biography more interesting than his books.
I, I tried a couple of the Sea of Fertility books and thought they were pretty dull.
But, uh, the song starts,
When we saw Mishima's dog trapped between, trapped between the rocks, blocking the waterfall.
And what this refers to, uh, is that in, in Mishima's work, and I think particularly the Sea of Fertility trilogy,
it's tracking a couple people through various eras of, of recent Japanese history,
who may or may not be reincarnations of, of the same two people over and over again.
And one of them believes in this and one of them doesn't.
And there is a scene where they are out in the country and, uh, see a waterfall,
but it's only trickling.
There's hardly anything coming down.
So they walk up to the top of the waterfall,
and there's a dog's carcass blocking the little stream that's supposed to be feeding the waterfall.
And at one point later in the book, uh, the second character says to the first of the future,
I'll see you again under the waterfall.
And the first one thinks, he's referring to, uh, reincarnation, to cyclicality,
to the way the water, you know, flows and flows back and follows reliable patterns
and is always different, but is always the same.
He's saying we'll see each other again.
And what the second one means is, no, I'll see you when we're both the corpses of dogs,
because that's what we're going to be sooner or later, because that's what everything becomes.
And then you line that up with the second half of that first verse in heat,
which, uh, if my memory is correct, goes, uh, the songs of dust, the world would end,
the night was always falling, the peacock in the snow.
And then the refrain, uh, I tell myself, I don't know who I am.
I tell myself, I don't know who I am.
My father ran the prison.
So the songs of dust, the world would end thing.
This is really what gave me sort of the, the, the transurrection or, or inverse apocalypse
concept that, you know, the song that would make the world end.
Yes, it does.
It's happening all the time.
A million songs have made the world end and it's going to keep ending.
The night was always falling.
Yes, it is all the time.
People love to say, you know, everyone in history has thought the apocalypse is going
to happen in their lifetime.
Yeah, here we are.
Motherfucker did happen in their lifetime.
It wasn't your apocalypse.
It was their fucking apocalypse.
And, and this, this constant hypersensitized paranoid dread about being at the end of things.
You are at the fucking end of things.
Now, something may follow from them, but you don't know what.
You don't know that you're going to be there for it or that you're going to be particularly
happy there.
So, yeah, the, the night is always falling.
A song is enough to bring the fucking dusk down and in the world.
And this is, you know, the, the transit of, of, of transurrection that you are brought back
to life only in a world that is more dead.
You die, you are brought back, but the penalty is that the world you inhabit has to be more
dead every time you return from the dead.
And then those, those two lines in the chorus that Bowie repeats, I think are a summary of
the entire thing.
Um, I tell myself, I don't know who I am.
And then my father ran the prison and as with everything else in this album, most, you know,
jackass critics took that at face value and thought, Oh, it's about identity and how he's
played all these different characters and he's lost sight of his real self.
No, no, no.
It's about exactly the opposite.
It is about a man who has seen the world as a concentric spiral of cities of the dead,
a concentric spiral of necropolies.
And he's not saying, I don't know who I am.
He is saying, I tell myself, I don't know who I am.
As in, I'm lying.
As in, I know exactly who I am.
I know exactly what is in front of me, but I cannot possibly admit that.
I cannot allow that thought to remain in my brain.
So I tell myself, I don't know who I am.
And then my father ran the prison and it's these two lines.
I tell myself, I don't know who I am.
And my father ran the prison that also in the record, my father ran the prison.
So first you try to pretend you don't know who you are.
You try to pretend that you do not live among the concentric cities of the dead.
And when that falls through, when you can't keep that up, you, like fucking Haynes says to Stephen in Ulysses,
I suppose history is to blame.
You simply go, oh, well, my dad, the previous generations, you know, all those people who made the world the way it is.
I mean, what can you do?
Their fault, but at least we're innocent, right?
And it is a perfect mirror image of the way in Heroes, you slingshot back and forth between the feeling of total helplessness and the self-delusion that your own personal life can change the world.
Well, here, almost exactly what would have been 46 years between these albums here, instead of grandiose self-delusion, exchanging places with complete powerlessness.
Now, it is the excuse that your father ran the prison, the excuse that this was all here already and we just inherited it.
You know, poor, poor, pitiful us.
That alternating with, I know exactly who I am.
And if I admit that I know it, that will be maybe not just the end of my life, but the end of life for anyone.
Man.
Well, I grew up in the client state of a petro king
With a complicated take on things like human rights
But baby, that's the sacrifice
For bringing joy to the world
And I learned young how the West was won
With Christ's big heart and a bigger gun
It wasn't enough, so we took the moon
Cause Nazi rock, it's science too
Can bring joy to the world
The war on drugs, this righteous cause
To clear our streets of criminals
Now civilized by an opioid
So the Sackler family can enjoy
Spreading joy around the world
For New York City
The world loves you when retribution's surely due
For the zealous who brought you hell
And Langley taught them well
How to infiltrate joy
And do it to the world
Can't we all just get along
Like Amazon and Raytheon
Coming together to make a drone
To bring us lunch and kill the sons
In a sick, just a two-for-one
Holistic joy
To the world
To the world
Please stop resisting all the joy
In your world
Just a car full of celebrities
Singing about the joy
In your world
In your world
In your world
In your world
A string of bad luck
In this final turn
We gathered around
And watched our cities burn
Who could have possibly predicted this?
Said everyone
So we boldly venture into the black
Guided by a grand soundtrack
We'll liberate some foreign stars
And stick a flag on the face of Mars
Does the beauty of starting again?
Your patience, zero and original sin
The mantra rings across the land
How clever
Look at us
We've done it again
We're bringing joy
To whole new worlds
You must admit
We've certainly got a knife for
Bringing joy
To whole new worlds
In the town these aliens were underlined
And the dawn of the joy
We'll bring a whole new worlds
We're bringing joy
We're bringing joy
We're bringing joy
We're bringing joy
We're bringing joy
To your world
We're bringing joy
We're bringing joy
You better hope you don't have dead dinosaurs
We'll bring joy to the world
You better hope you don't have big plans
Or else we'll bring it
profitable
It may be applicable
Have another conversation
This act
