All right.
So first things first, thank you to everybody who has listened to the inaugural episode of Judge Movies.
And as I've said, I am going to be posting some of those early episodes for free in the Death Corner feed.
But you really, really got to subscribe to that show.
Trust me.
I have heard maybe half a dozen of the episodes that haven't come out yet.
And they're fucking great.
The Full Metal Jacket one is incredible.
The Eyes Wide Shut one is incredible.
And he and I just the other day recorded an episode on A Clockwork Orange that, if I say so myself, I think is one of the best shows I've ever been a part of.
It went fantastically well.
You will want to subscribe to that show.
And I, you know, I don't want to speak on my brother's behalf and like guarantee you anything.
But I think just because of the nature of the show, I'm probably going to be something of a recurring guest.
And so if you want to hear me talk about a bunch of shit that I don't talk about on here and also some of the same things I talk about on here, you will want to subscribe to Judge Movies.
Please, please.
Please, I could not recommend it more highly.
And now to an order of business that has been kind of preying on me for a while now.
And incidentally, I just want to say, sorry if I sound kind of drawly or mush mouth or strung out this episode.
It's not drugs.
It's that the increasing volatility of winter weather in western Missouri is absolutely fucking awful for my migraines.
And I have had about a month of some of the worst migraines of my life.
So if I if I don't sound at my sharpest, that is why I have known for a while now that I needed to go back to the Cartel USA series and to do a final kind of, you know, up to the present day summation episode.
Because in a way, that's what all of this is for.
That's that's what it's been leading to.
And as absurd as it may sound for me to give anything like a content warning for one of my shows, you know, my job is talking about the worst shit in the world.
I am I am I am going to warn you about the last story in this episode, which incidentally, I got put on to by Twitter users CIA heart attack gun.
So thank you to him or her.
I actually don't know.
It's.
It's awful.
The last thing I'm going to talk about on this show is awful.
It's going to be rough to listen to.
And frankly, it's going to be rough for me to talk about.
I don't know how well I'm going to get through it.
So I apologize if I have to pause a couple of times because it is.
It's incredibly ugly.
It's one of those things that, you know, I come back over and over to the line Colonel Kurt says in Apocalypse Now.
It it makes me want to tear my teeth out.
It makes me wish that I could travel back in time and undo the Big Bang because any universe in which this story is possible shouldn't exist.
And I mean, I guess I encourage you to listen to the whole thing because I think it's important to know about.
But it is going to be rough listening and it's also going to be rough talking about it.
So as a brief recapitulation of the whole Cartel USA series, we've talked at length about how a number of the great American fortunes, you know, the early robber barons, people like Russell, Samuel Russell and his trading company, people like the Astors, people like the fucking Delanos, the Coolidge's.
And built their money in part or in some cases nearly in total on the opium trade.
And we have talked about how that opium trade and the forced importation of opium to China beginning in the 1770s with Portugal, but very rapidly picked up by the British,
which essentially destabilized the Chinese government enough in the mid 1800s via the opium wars that those opium wars and the loss of legitimacy that they caused for, you know, the, the, I believe it was still the Qing dynasty at the time,
was so catastrophic that it led quite directly to the rebellion of the Taiping heavenly kingdom, which killed modern estimates are about 20 million people.
Just blood all over all of our hands and, and wars that I think most Americans have probably never even heard of who the fuck, you know,
other than Matt Christman, who knows about the Taiping rebellion now.
And I've talked about how those same robber barons, whether they were, you know, directly dope peddlers like the Russells or whether they were,
uh, they were making money in industries like say railroads, you know, the Harrimans or, uh, oil, gasoline, fuel in general,
the, the, the Rockefellers, uh, that had a very close relationship with the drug trade because those industries required not only worldwide intelligence networks that were also, uh,
very effective, effective for things like the distribution of drugs and, you know, those, those companies and before them, you know,
the British East India company, the Dutch East India company, very, very much, um, one of the, the key predecessors for, for organizations like the CIA.
You combine them with, uh, with, with the incel networks set up by Wall Street law firms, for example,
like a Sullivan and Cromwell, the home of the Dulles brothers. And you have pretty much everything you need for both a global intelligence network and a global drug trafficking network.
And of course a, a ton of that fucking drug money went into founding all the most pious sanctimonious programs of, uh, the Ivy league schools and often into just straight up building the Ivy league schools themselves.
If you could get an honest accounting of, let's say the, the complete sources of Harvard's endowment at this point, which I believe is well over a billion dollars.
If you got deep enough into that, it would be opium morphine heroin. The it's, it is completely endemic to all the most prestigious, you know, institutions of higher learning in the United States.
And then we, uh, talked about the, you know, sort of end of the 19th beginning of the 20th centuries in which synthetic opioids like methadone start becoming important in which, uh, for that matter, heroin starts becoming important is, uh, is synthesized is not the word because it's not synthetic, but heroin, I suppose is, I would, you would say discovered independently in, uh,
England in the 1870s and in Germany in the 1890s, I believe it was, uh, Merck, either Merck or Bayer. Every time I say Merck, I think of that, the Martin Short scene and, uh, in inherent vice, you know, I just got this from Merck in Darmstadt.
Uh, the incredibly close relations between these hideous fucking German chemical cartels, uh, that were creating and selling synthetic opioids often just over the counter.
And with every single fucking one of them. And with every single fucking one of them. And this is very important to keep in mind.
You go from opium to natural extracts of opium, like morphine and codeine to altered extracts of, of opium, like heroin, uh, to synthetic opioids like methadone.
And at every step along that path, every one of those new inventions as is marketed as, Oh, it's the, it's the opium. You can't get addicted to.
Sure. Opium is addictive, but morphine isn't. Well, sure. Morphine is addictive, but codeine isn't. Okay. So they're all addictive, but heroin. I mean, I think we all know you can't get addicted to heroin.
And in order to keep that, that opiate trade running, um, as has come up a million times on this show recently, there were incestuously close relationships between people like IG Farben, the, the German chemical cartel that essentially managed World War II for the Third Reich.
And between people like Alan Dulles at Sullivan and Cromwell and Walter Teagle at Standard Oil, which would, uh, become, uh, Standard Oil of New Jersey, pardon me, which would become Exxon.
And Edsel Ford at Ford at Ford Motor Company and General Motors. These, these, these Nazi, uh, chemical cartels are so intermeshed with American business concerns on the one hand and with American, you know, high finance and proto intelligence agencies like Wall Street, uh, law firms on the other hand, that they really can't be considered separate entities.
They are semi-interchangeable parts in, in, in a global cartel basically that is sort of what, um, Thomas Pinchon meant in talking about, you know, the rocket and stat, the rocket city.
There is a, uh, the rocket city.
There is a, uh, the rocket city.
There is a, a supranational political entity made up of people who were never elected to any goddamn office, who never had to have their credentials checked by any voter, and who actually exert most of the power in the world via the confluence of, uh, money and influence and, and material goods production that essentially keeps capitalism running for, for, for,
most of the 20th century.
So we've gotten to all that stuff about how, um, the, the beginnings of the CIA, for example, are 100% wrapped up in the beginnings of, uh, or not the beginnings of, but in the ongoing activities of IG Farben.
That without the people who would later go on to found the CIA, IG Farben would not have been able to power the German war effort in World War II.
As Albert Speer himself said, uh, they couldn't have invaded Poland without the synthetic fuel technology they were given by General Motors and Standard Oil.
So I feel like all that is pretty well established at this point.
And I'm, I'm going to try to do the rest of the history, uh, a little bit quickly so I can get to some specific examples I want to talk about.
Um, beginning in that same, uh, proto CIA, IG Farben interlock era, we also get what, uh, Gene Hackman has now, uh, monumentalized as the French connection.
And I think it's very important to understand that as you know, the, the wartime relationships struck up between, uh, these German cartels and their American investors and management and corporate partners, as that starts to get a little bit more complicated, uh, as the war drags on, of course, they were able to grant themselves total immunity afterward.
But with the war happening, we kind of need a new, uh, network for the, the global opium trade and especially, uh, uh, opiates in the form of heroin.
And when you hear the French connection, uh, talked about under that title, it's usually thought of as a drug smuggling network and, and just a drug smuggling network.
And that is at the, the most basic level, what it was, the, the French connection operated in, um, you know, the, the skeletal description of it would be essentially you get, um, opium and opium byproducts from Southeast Asia, which of course at the time, uh, is full of French colonial holdings, you know, French Indochina in particular, which would become Vietnam.
Uh, uh, the members of the colonial occupying power smuggle out these drugs across, uh, Central Asia and, uh, usually not invariably, but usually Turkey was a really important access point for the French connection.
You get these drugs from, you know, you get these drugs from, you know, Southern or I should say Eastern and Southeastern Asia, uh, overland and then into Europe and subsequently into America by going through Turkey.
And I am not by any means a, uh, you know, a well-qualified historian of modern Turkey.
It's actually something I need to learn a lot more about.
Um, but as you will probably know, if you have listened to this show very often, the term deep state, the whole context of the deep state first emerges, uh, as a notion in Turkey to try to describe the way that, you know, this, this new country, you know, the, the Turkey of Kemal Ataturk after about 1920.
It's, it's, it's, it's a country that has some kind of coup or semi-temporary, uh, military dictatorship and appointment of a new government, like every 10 years, like clockwork for a long time.
And yet the, the interests of the intelligence state in Turkey and of its numerous connections to international crime, those are never disturbed for this entire period.
It doesn't matter who's president, prime minister, dictator, you know, whatever term they choose to use at the time, all this shit keeps going on.
All of these drugs from Southeast Asia keep going through Turkey.
And, uh, the, the term deep state was an early attempt to conceptualize how this was possible.
Uh, there was a certain, I think, uh, Ben talked about this on true and on a certain famous event in Turkey called the Susarlik incident in which, uh, a number of people were killed in a car crash who by any logical standard should not have been in a car together.
I can't remember precisely who it was, but, but for, you know, for an American context, let's say there was a big car wreck and somehow the people who were in the car that got killed were, uh, Dick Cheney, fucking Santo Traficante.
And like Lizzo, you know, these people who would appear to have nothing to do with each other.
And yet, uh, not only clearly knew each other, but clearly knew each other from working together.
And it became clear to, you know, commentators upon Turkish politics at the time that there was this abiding deep state structure across the history of modern Turkey that not only wasn't particularly affected by what were, um, cast as, you know, regime changes, but actually played a big role in engineering those regime changes often for its own benefit.
And the major sort of power source for this deep state was the, the drug trade and particularly, uh, the opiate and especially heroin trade coming through there out of, uh, French colonies in Southeast Asia.
And from Turkey, this French connection, heroin would often go through Corsica, you know, the, the island that's sort of semi-Italian, semi-French.
Um, and I gather they have their own sort of, uh, uh, uh, national identity concept as well.
And this is part of the reason that when you get into operation Gladio stuff, when you look into the links between Gladio and say the JFK assassination, you get so many people who happen to be from Corsica.
Um, the villain in the movie, the French connection, well, everybody's a villain in that movie, but the, the French drug trafficking villain is purportedly based on a guy named Lucien Sarty.
And Sarty was a major mob figure, um, an assassin and also someone with, as you would imagine, fucking knee deep intelligence connections.
And there has been thought, and it's unproven, you know, who knows what we'll ever learn.
There's been thought that Lucien Sarty, uh, may have been directly involved with killing John Kennedy.
And in some versions of the story may have even fired the shot that killed John Kennedy.
Personally, I kind of doubt it would be someone like Sarty because, you know, he's, he's more of an administrator and all this.
Uh, but he also did kill people for money.
And even if it wasn't Sarty personally, the, the network of people I was talking about, uh, in the recent JFK episodes, uh, people from, you know, Vichy France holdouts who still supported the Nazis or people who were, uh, French fascists who objected to Nazi occupation, not on the grounds of Nazi occupation.
But on the grounds of occupation, people who shared a whole lot of ideology in common with the Nazis, but simply didn't want to be a German satellite colony, for example.
And lots of these people like Jean Filliol and Jean Souetre, uh, very directly trained with the SS.
And, uh, in particular with Otto Skorzeny, who is, you know, the king of the spider network.
Um, the, the guy who is connected to fucking everything.
The guy who went from being Hitler's favorite paratrooper to, uh, to training, you know, uh, Vichy SS and paratroopers to being involved in massive, uh, financial and drug smuggling networks.
And in fact, people smuggling networks, you know, the rat lines helping Nazis get out of Germany before the war, often via Francisco Franco's Spain.
And who then started the first modern, uh, private military contractor, the Paladin Group, which did, uh, extensive work, not just for people, uh, you might imagine, uh, would have a natural connection to Nazi Germany.
Like, say, the United States, but also work for people like, uh, Israel, work for people like Egypt, all over the fucking world.
That was your man.
And so all of these people, this, this sort of, you know, I use the term Gladio in the broad sense, basically the, the semi-underground fascist paramilitary international, the spider network, basically.
Um, they are all very heavily connected to this French connection, uh, opium and heroin smuggling route, particularly through Lucien Sarty and Corsica.
Uh, and then from, uh, uh, the heroin would generally go through Marseille, uh, the port city in, in the south of France along the Mediterranean, which is legendarily a massive drug smuggling city.
I think it was, oh, I can't remember who said this, but I, I once heard someone refer to Marseille as, uh, North Algeria and particularly as, uh, North Tangier, which of course was a, another massive drug smuggling city.
Uh, and from Marseille, this stuff would go out over mainland Europe and to the United States.
And of course on the United States side, this is very deeply, uh, connected to the mafia, uh, particularly to people like Santo Traficante, who was the mob drug Lord of Florida.
Uh, to people like, uh, to people like, uh, to people like Sam Giancana, uh, all people who have one or another degree of connection to, uh, the CIA and to the anti Castro, you know, exile Cuban right wing shit that culminated by murdering John Kennedy.
And I think it's important to understand when we look at something like Gladio in, in the widescreen, you know, in the big picture, um, we think of it and not incorrectly as essentially this network of fascist cells, sometimes large and complex enough that they sort of amounted to fascist governments in waiting.
Uh, as in the case of, uh, as in the case of, uh, Junio Valerio Borghese in Italy that were largely armed and maintained by NATO and the CIA, uh, to prevent communism from, from taking not even communism to prevent very mild social democracy from taking any kind of hold in, uh, mainland Europe after world war II.
Because as I've mentioned before, a lot of people who beat the Nazis in not just overall, but in these individual specific countries, Italy, Greece, whatever, were communists and socialists and even sometimes anarchists.
And so people were, were, uh, rather favorably disposed toward those political tendencies after the war was over.
And of course we had to make sure that that never happened to the point of just outright invalidating Italian elections to the point of, uh, killing Aldo Moro, the, uh, Italian prime minister and making it look like a, you know, far left guerrilla.
The Brigado Rosso operation.
Um, I believe it was Henry Kissinger himself who said to Aldo Moro's face, if you put socialists in your government, you, you are, you know, unleashing the whirlwind.
You are going to get what is coming to you.
Pretty clear threat.
And this of course connects to all kinds of other stuff from fucking, you know, the South African Gestapo to Le Cercle and the Rockefellers and the Council on Foreign Relations and September 11th and Iran Contra.
There are, there are, there's just a, a practical infinity of connections here.
But one thing I think is important to understand in this context, when we're talking about opiates and particularly heroin is that this heroin being smuggled from Southeast Asia through Turkey, then through Corsica and Marseille, and then to the rest of, you know, the Western world.
This was not strictly a mafia money making business.
This shit was not being orchestrated by people who were only interested in dealing drugs, who were, you know, who were businessmen in the drug trade and had no ambitions or awareness outside of that.
That is not the case at all.
In lots and lots of instances, these drugs were smuggled precisely to provide off the books revenue for Gladio, CIA and NATO operations all throughout Europe.
And the people who were, you know, involved in running this trade, again, they were not just sort of apolitical guys who wanted to get rich.
They were people with deep connections to Italian fascism and to, you know, attempted Greek Nazism, basically.
And to Vichy France and to La Cagoule, that, you know, French fascist order that tried to stage one coup in the mid-30s and then tried to kill, was involved in trying to kill de Gaulle a number of times in the 50s and 60s.
And people like the OAS, the Organization Armée Secrets, the super far-right cadre of the French military who essentially cut their loyalty to the French state after de Gaulle pulled out of Algeria and became basically the French Navy SEALs whose objective was to kill the president.
Again, I was going to say fascist Navy SEALs, but that's what they call a pleonasm.
It's redundant.
The global heroin trade was not simply about making a profit.
It was about maintaining all these dirty, secret, off-books operations all over the world, but especially from Western Europe to kind of the Levant to the Middle East.
Operations that, you know, they probably could have in some cases just openly, you know, filed invoices to the CIA, you know, Cold War.
But they didn't really want to get caught doing that.
And so the drug trade, the way fucking opium manages to get from, you know, from Vietnam, from India, from China to in the form of heroin getting to, you know, fucking Charlie Parker in New York City.
That's not just the drug trade.
That is the key financial organizational principle of all of those, you know, international fascist paramilitary undergrounds that we now group under the name Gladio.
And I'm going to talk a lot more in an episode soon about aspects of Gladio that I think we have either misunderstood or I think we have not really wanted to look at.
Because they provide a great deal of insight into not just how the world actually works, but how Gladio in particular has served as not just this one program of, you know, as the book has it, NATO's secret armies.
That was the beginning of Gladio.
But Gladio still exists in a million forms.
And according to some people, it even still exists under that particular name.
Gladio touches everything from, you know, Alan Dulles trying to broker a separate peace with the Third Reich in 1944,
all the way to Operation Cyclone in Afghanistan and the U.S. and Saudi Arabia via the Wahhabization program,
helping to collect every, you know, far right insane fundamentalist they could to send them to Afghanistan to kill Soviets.
And from there, all the way up to September 11th.
And from there, all the way up to exactly what is happening right fucking now in Ukraine.
I think the, it's not just that parallels to Gladio are obvious in Ukraine.
It's that straight up unambiguous Gladio shit is already happening, not just in Ukraine, but as a direct result of Ukraine.
I mean, what do you call arming and funding a bunch of Nazi militias?
If that's not Gladio, I don't know what the fuck it is.
And what do you call it when those people's weapons somehow end up in the hands of Italian neo-fascists
who are planning to commit terrorist attacks?
Or in the hands of, you know, some bizarre kind of doddering dickbag, you know, self-appointed German prince
who thinks he's going to lead a revolution under the group name of Citizens of the Reich.
Like, I mean, it doesn't take a whole lot of explaining, you know, if you know the basic details of it.
But the point I am making there, as it relates to heroin and opiates,
is that there was this massive trade, you know, spanning the entire Eurasian landmass.
But it wasn't just selling drugs.
It's never just selling drugs.
There has never been any kind of large-scale drug trafficking operation
where people handed over drugs and got money back
and then they just sat on the money and were happy and rich.
That's not how it goes.
Because if you were any sort of high-volume, high-profile criminal,
and consider this for a moment,
we know all these people's names.
We know who they were.
And you probably know,
especially if you, you know, listen to any hip-hop over the last 30 years,
you know the names of some real famous drug kingpins,
including people who are still alive
and sometimes aren't even in jail.
So how the fuck is it that I can name, you know,
a drug lord from Atlanta,
that I know who that is,
and yet that guy is not dead?
That guy is not in prison?
How is that possible?
And the answer, as it always is in these things,
is that there is a kind of a...
No, asymptote would not be the exact point.
Well, no, that sort of works.
There's a sort of dual asymptotic approach from both sides.
Between organized crime and intelligence networks,
and particularly the CIA,
because it has been the most powerful intelligence network of,
you know, the last 80 years.
If you are committing any kind of crime
on a high enough volume,
at a large enough scale,
that you are not only very rich,
but you are also getting away with it,
even though people know who you are,
you have political protection.
That is the only way to be a drug kingpin,
so famous, so powerful,
that I can tell you his name,
and yet he's not dead or in jail.
That's fucking impossible to do by yourself.
And I think anyone who has ever moved drugs
at any kind of serious volume
has very quickly run into the reality
that if you want to keep doing that business,
okay, fine.
But there is going to be a cut of your money
that goes to fund things like
off-book CIA operations,
and fascist paramilitary cells,
and CIA black site torture centers
all around the world,
you are going to have to cut them in for that shit.
And you're probably going to have to
turn over other people involved with you
to stay out of prison.
But of course,
if you're purely ruthless about it,
you can also look at this as,
sure, yeah, I'm having to cut in,
you know, fucking Westland New Post in Belgium
on my heroin profits,
so that I can have these completely insane
Brabant massacres of, you know,
guys in blackface with machine guns
just destroying grocery stores
for no fucking reason.
Yeah, you could look at that as a kind of tax,
or you could look at that
as a very beneficial relationship
to say that because I am helping fund
that kind of thing,
I am buying protection.
You know, the sort of echeloning,
the scaling of protection rackets,
it never really stops.
You know, all the way down to,
like, you know,
give me and my boys $50 a week
so we don't fuck up your,
you know, fruit stand.
All the way up to kick money up
to the CIA for off-books operations
so they don't bring you in
on a fucking Interpol warrant.
It's all the same, you know,
it's turtles all the way down.
Racketeering and extortion,
they scale up and down to all levels.
And in that same sense,
if you are of the temperament
to look at having to pay out,
say the CIA,
is actually good for you,
then flipping on
other powerful people
within, you know,
the international drug trade,
that's security.
You are buying your own
continued supremacy
in this field.
And as I have mentioned
a million times
and will never stop mentioning,
that early 2010's
El Universal article
about how the CIA and DEA
had been collaborating
with the Sinaloa cartel
for well over 20 years
at that point.
I mean, I think that's pretty clearly
what Chapo Guzman
or, you know,
one of his,
one of his lieutenants was doing,
was realizing
we have scaled up
this drug trafficking
to a point
where we can't keep working
without some kind
of political protection.
And so what we're going to do
is kick a percentage
of the profits
to the people
who in theory
should be trying to arrest us,
and we're going to give them
information
about all our competitors.
And so the CIA,
the DEA,
you know,
the various echelons
of Mexican federal
judicial police,
they're going to go
after everybody else.
And though it seems
like a pain in the ass
now to deal with,
you know,
the American intelligence state,
it's actually going to work out
really well for us
in the long term.
And it did.
For, what,
30 fucking years?
Sinaloa was basically
untouchable?
And, you know,
we're still sort of
in the insane
interranean period
of warfare
between other cartels.
And I personally
sort of doubt
that there is a
Sinaloa-style
agreement
of the same
durability,
of the same
strength
in place
right now.
But no mistake about it,
there will be another one.
We will pick
another cartel
and decide
to let them do
whatever the fuck
they want
in exchange
for some money
for illegal shit
we want to do
and in exchange
for information
on the other cartels.
So,
the larger point
of the French connection
here
is not just,
you know,
yeah,
these people ran heroin
from here to here.
It's that
the French connection
also provided
one of the
primary financial
mechanisms
to keep
the Gladio system
alive.
And then,
in late 1960s,
you know,
we are deeply
embroiled
in Vietnam
and for that matter
in Cambodia
and Laos
and a number
of people
whose job
it is to
consider such
things
considered that,
you know,
we could actually
have a lot
more direct
access
to this shit
because the whole
French connection
system,
you know,
relies on
little sort
of cadres
and operations
all over the
world to make
it work.
Well,
what if instead
of doing that,
we just got
the CIA
directly involved
in taking
opium and heroin
from the
Golden Triangle,
you know,
Vietnam,
Cambodia,
Laos,
and selling it
worldwide,
including back
in the United
States.
And that is
exactly what we
did at the
end of the
60s,
then all through
the 70s.
There are a
couple books
to read about
this.
I have read
both of them,
but I also read
both of them
right before I
had to quit
being a junkie,
so they've
been kind of
sandblasted
out of my
brain,
except for
the basic
details of
them.
But a
book by
Henrik Kruger
called The
Great Heroin
Coup,
and a book
by Alfred
McCoy
called The
Politics of
Heroin in
Southeast Asia,
that McCoy,
to my
understanding,
is the guy
who first
uncovered all
of this.
that not
just American
military officials,
not even just
Vietnamese,
that is,
Republic of
Vietnam,
and Cambodian
and Laotian
military officials
were involved
in drug
trafficking on
a local
scale,
but that the
CIA was
involved in
this on an
international
scale,
and was in
fact supplanting
the old
French connection
as the major
global source
of heroin.
And as I
believe I
mentioned on
one of the
previous episodes
about this,
one of our
reasons for
trafficking
heroin both
in and out
of Southeast
Asia was
so we could
fund incredibly
illegal black
books operations
with that
heroin money.
So we could
run, for
example, the
Phoenix program,
a lot of
the Phoenix
program ran
on money
made from
drug trafficking
because you
have the
official explanation
of the Phoenix
program, which
is that it
was a
counterinsurgency
intelligence
interrogation
and assassin
program, which
of course is
horrible enough
in itself.
They killed
probably something
like 100,000
people for no
fucking reason,
but the Phoenix
program was
also an
incredible
logistical
undertaking,
both because
of the way
it served,
as I've
mentioned many
times, the
way it served
as the first
real-time
field test for
what essentially
ended up becoming
the internet,
the way that
ARPANET was
employed as a
central tactical
pillar of the
Phoenix program,
program, but
also there
was a shitload
of construction
and contracting
involved in the
Phoenix program.
They built
tons and tons
of these sort
of fly-by-night
secret prisons
and interrogation
centers and
eventually execution
facilities.
These things were
popping up all
the fuck over
Vietnam in very
isolated locales,
places you would
never find unless
you knew what
you were looking
for.
And for a
financial undertaking
of that sort,
if you are
looking to
avoid having any
questions being
asked about what
the fuck you're
doing with,
let's say,
the five billion
dollars we gave
you, you're going
to want another
revenue stream.
And that other
revenue stream,
in large part,
was heroin and
morphine and
other derivatives
of opium.
And as I
mentioned,
fucking one of
the people running
this was Ted
Shackley, the
guy who,
previous to his
involvement in
Vietnam, was
most notable for
running JM
Wave, which was
a CIA anti-Castro
program run
off the campus
of the University
of Miami that
did Psywar stuff,
propaganda stuff,
and also may
very well have
been involved in
actual terrorist
attacks against
Cuba and
assassination
attempts against
Fidel Castro.
that was the
guy who was
doing the, you
know, the drug
money logistics
for the Phoenix
program in, in
Vietnam from the
late 60s onward.
And his two top
lieutenants were
Felix Rodriguez,
a longtime, like,
CIA demon legend
who is allegedly
the man who
personally murdered
Che Guevara,
although, you know,
he would say
that, wouldn't
he?
And even more
interestingly than
him, Oliver
North, a name
you might know,
a name that
comes up later
when we start
looking into
the question
of, essentially,
government-operated
drug traffic
being used to
fund illegal
intelligence and
military operations.
Now, the other
thing about the
Vietnam connection
from the late
60s onward is
that it
coincides very
precisely with
Richard Nixon
launching the
war on drugs,
as we have come
to call it.
And I know I've
said this a
million times on
the show, but I
think it bears
repeating, people
very close to
Nixon, people who
were involved in
the formulation of
this policy, you
know, H.R.
Haldeman, John
Ehrlichman, his
policy advisors, his
sort of, his
personal consultants
have come straight
out later and
said the war on
drugs had nothing
to do with
lessening the
amount of drug
trafficking and
drug use inside
the United States.
We didn't give a
fuck about that.
In fact, we were
aiming to increase
the profusion of
drugs in the
United States
because, of course,
we're bringing
fucking boatloads
of this shit in
from Vietnam and
Laos and Cambodia
at exactly the
same time.
The point of the
war on drugs was
to take all of
these drugs we
were bringing into
the country and
then distribute
them among people
whom we wished
to oppress or
imprison or
straight up kill.
And that meant
in the early
70s, primarily
black people and
leftists and
especially black
leftists.
If you had
anything to do
with a group
like the
Panthers, that
is who these
people were
fucking coming
after.
I mean, remember
this is the same
period where one
of the guys who
was in charge of
a failed JFK
assassination attempt,
Daniel Groth,
also led the,
you could call it
a raid, I would
call it an
assassination, that
murdered Fred
Hampton in his
fucking sleep.
these were the
people that a
big section of
the deep state,
I think it's fair
to say, that term
has been kind of
mangled now, but
in the Peter Dale
Scott sense of
deep state, not the
fucking Alex Jones
sense, what scared
a lot of those
people most was
the idea of
left-wing political
militancy among
black people, and
especially in poor,
run-down, ghettoized,
segregated black
neighborhoods.
That scared the
shit out of them.
So, then you flood
those neighborhoods
with heroin, and
suddenly, if you have
enough drugs, and you
have enough people who
are living in absolute
misery and privation
and poverty, who,
through no fault of
their own, through no
failing of fucking
moral character, will
turn to drugs, either
to use them to get
through the fucking
day, or to sell
them because it's the
only way to make a
goddamn living, all
of a sudden, every
black person, every
leftist, and every
black leftist, you
want to put in jail,
you suddenly have
the data and the
webs of connections,
you know, the network
of associations and
memberships and so
forth, to bring that
person in on charges
of drug trafficking,
or conspiracy to
traffic drugs, or
one of the many, many,
many, you know, drug
adjacent charges that
technically isn't you
sold drugs, but under
the laws we have so
scrupulously rewritten
over the last 50 years
or so, if you're just
sort of anywhere near
anyone who sells drugs
and you happen to be
black and especially
black and politically
militant, we can put
your ass in jail for
that.
And if you look at the
number of former
black Panthers who
either went to jail
behind a drug beef or
got killed allegedly
over a drug beef in the
70s, that list is
pretty fucking long.
And I have a lot of
trouble believing,
knowing what we know
about, say, just the
CIA or the FBI or
even the LAPD now,
that I don't think those
drug beefs gone wrong,
I just cannot believe that
story.
I think probably,
in many, if not most
occasions, they were
targeted assassinations
into which the deep
state had insinuated
this element of, you
know, the flood of
heroin in from
Southeast Asia, knowing
that they could use
that to incriminate
and ultimately,
effectively, to
lynch these
politically militant
black people they were
terrified of.
And that is what the
war on drugs was
for.
That's what it's
always fucking been
for.
And we can, as I
often say, thank
Joe fucking Biden
for the Clinton-era
crime bill that
basically put, let's
say, you get caught
smoking weed three
times, that puts you
on a par with, like,
a serial rapist.
You'll be in jail for
the rest of your
fucking life.
And I think it's
important to understand
that shift in American
culture as, and I
mean this in the
most technical sense
of the word, as a
PSYOP, as a
psychological warfare
operation.
Because, you know, at
the end of the
60s, the sort of
Goldwater
conservatism movement
is fizzling out,
and they're looking
for the next thing
because, obviously,
Nixon kind of made
some enemies, not
going so great.
And the Republican
Party at large finds
its answer in the
then-putative Reagan
movement, this
marriage of,
essentially, wasp
California fascism
with evangelical
Christianity, which,
you know, have been
married at the hip for
a long time, but
before Reagan,
before the kind of,
you can't quite call
them neocons exactly,
but the neocons
before the neocons,
the Reagan
Republicans.
Until that generation
of politicians,
evangelical Christians
and members of, you
know, various sort of
claustral, secretive,
far-right Christian
groups, they
generally didn't vote.
A lot of them
considered voting to
be a sinful
concession to the
ways of the world,
a sinful form of
involvement in, you
know, mankind's
inherent errancy,
which was a
dangerous way to
remove yourself
from, you know, the
inerrant beneficence
of the Lord.
And one of the ways
the Reagan movement
really took off and
ended up first
taking over the
whole Republican
Party, and now
most federally
elected Democrats are
basically Reagan
Republicans too.
One of the ways they
did that was to
place drugs at the
center of their
agenda.
Because it's not like
this country has ever
been, you know,
particularly friendly
toward drug users.
But the standard
kind of white,
ex-urban,
upper-middle-class
idea that every
one of our cities
is a cesspit of
open warfare
over, like,
drug trafficking
territory,
that's a fairly new
idea.
People didn't think
that shit in the
50s.
You know, I'm sure
there were plenty of
people who, you know,
would have thought you
deserve to be shot for
smoking reefers,
but this idea of,
you know,
an America at war
with,
they would call it,
you know,
drug traffic,
which is to say
poor inner-city
black people.
That is something
Reagan really,
really pushed
as part of his
rise from
being governor of
California to being
president.
The idea that
there is,
you know,
essentially open
warfare in every
American city
of the noble
police and FBI
trying to defeat,
you know,
drug gangs,
to secretly
control all of
Los Angeles,
which is,
of course,
complete bullshit,
and we will get
in a moment to
one of the more
famous and obvious
reasons that that
is complete bullshit,
but that is
something I think
it's important to
understand that
has not always
been part of
sort of the
right-wing
American character.
This idea of
drugs as one of
the central
scourges,
if you're being,
you know,
sort of
insipidly
sincere about
it,
or if you
know what
you're saying,
drugs as the
ideal way to
imprison and
often just
murder poor
people,
especially poor
black people
in inner cities.
You know,
I've talked a
number of times
on this show
about the
insanity of
what are called
street terrorism
laws,
a number of
which were
passed in
the early
and mid
90s under
Bill Clinton
with the help
of Joe Biden.
And a
street terrorism
law is a
sort of
version of,
for example,
the difference
between assault
and aggravated
assault.
That, you know,
if you beat
somebody up,
that's one crime.
If you beat
somebody up with
something that
could have killed
them, that's a
different crime and
a more serious
one, right?
Well, under
these street
terrorism laws,
let's say you
and a guy get
in like a
dumb, drunk
shoving match
and you punch
him and you
get arrested.
And maybe
before you
would have,
you know,
you would have
been hit with
public drunkenness
and battery or
something like
that.
Well, now,
if the state
can make any
sort of claim
that you are
in any way
connected to
gang violence
or drug
trafficking,
they can hit
you instead
of those
basic charges
with a charge
called street
terrorism,
which is a
massive felony
and carries
with it
massive fucking
jail sentences.
And the
nature of
how we have
used drugs
in this
country,
how we have
taken them
not just
to fund
illegal
black books
operations,
but also
have used
them to
flood
predominantly
non-white,
predominantly
poor,
predominantly
urban
neighborhoods
to destroy
those neighborhoods
from within.
Well, that
means if you
are from,
say, a certain
part of Los
Angeles or a
certain part
of New York,
a certain part
really of
basically any
major city
in the United
States,
a prosecutor
will be able
to claim that
you are somehow
affiliated with
the Crips or
the Bloods or
the Gangster
Disciples or
whatever because
let's say you
grew up on a
block that is
part of, you
know, traditional
going back to
the 60s,
blood territory
or you grew up
on a Crip
block with a
Crip neighborhood
or you have
friends who were
Crips or even
something as
fucking stupid
as, you know,
there's a
picture of
you with
two of your
friends and
they both have
red bandanas
on or whatever
something that
has nothing to
do with you
being, you
know, a
fucking organized
enforcer for
inner city drug
gangs.
No, just that
alone, just like
here's a picture
of you and a
guy who's got,
you know, a
blue bandana
in his pocket.
That's enough
for fucking
street terrorism
and you can go
from, you know,
a dumb fist
fight to
being a
street terrorist
like fucking
that if a
prosecutor wants
to do that to
you.
And of course
prosecutors do
want to do
that to you
because, you
know, locking
up these
dangerous street
terrorists, what
an absurd
fucking street
terrorism as
opposed to
like architecture
terrorism.
I guess 9-11
would be
architecture
terrorism.
Like as
opposed to
like living
room terrorism.
Fucking Christ.
You know, it
makes these
fucking DAs
and state
attorneys general
look fantastic
because they can
paint themselves
as being, you
know, tough on
crime, tough on
drugs.
That, you know,
we found a guy
who he smoked
meth three times
and he once did
it while in the
company of a guy
with a blood
tattoo and so
now he's going
to prison for
50,000 years.
All right.
This is a rough
history of the
U.S.
political employment
of opiates up
to a certain
point.
And now I
want to talk
about something
that we're not
yet at the
point where it
can be historically
proven on a
purely factual
basis.
but it is
something that I
believe very
deeply.
And after I
describe this to
you, I'm going
to give you some
examples of
stories that
sound even less
believable than
this but are
completely true.
And that is where
we are going to get
into the very
fucking rough last
story in this
show.
And again,
apologies if I
break up a little
bit during that.
but the
opioid epidemic
of the 90s
and 2000s.
Now, that is a
phrase I
fucking hate
because opioid
epidemic makes
it sound like
fucking Spanish
flu.
Makes it sound
like malaria.
Oh, it's just
spread.
We couldn't have
known.
We had nothing
to do with it.
If only we'd
all taken the
vaccine.
No, no, no.
Fuck that.
There is no
opioid epidemic.
There is a
structural and
very intentional
distribution of
opioids.
And I will
call in specific
facts to make
this case.
I want to be
clear.
I don't know
that this is
completely correct.
But I do
very deeply
believe that
some version
of it is
correct.
So we
have been
using opium
opiates,
heroin,
and then
opium-derived
pills,
synthetics,
whatever,
to accomplish
basically three
goals across
this nation's
history.
Number one,
to make people
very, very,
very fucking
rich.
Number two,
to import
and use as
a form of
population
control.
and number
three,
to hyper
criminalize
until anyone
who's had
even the
most glancing
contact with
drug use
is now,
you know,
a fucking
death row
inmate.
And we
see a
cluster of
these things
happen right
in the mid
and late
90s.
So anybody
who knows a
little bit
about the
development of
neoliberalism,
you know,
about the
economic
stagnation of
the early
70s,
and what
was essentially
the Carter
administration's
decision to
give up
on the
New Deal,
essentially.
It wasn't
just Carter
himself,
it was,
you know,
the whole
New Democrat
coalition,
and the
DLC,
the Democratic
Leadership,
I can't remember
if it was
Council or
Coalition,
all these
motherfuckers
who called
themselves
New Democrats
in the
70s and
80s.
and their
position was
fuck poor
people,
fuck labor
unions,
fuck blue
collar workers,
fuck everybody
who has
traditionally been
our constituency
because we are
moving into an
age in which
this gigantic
post-war
economic boom
that has kept
so many of
us fat and
happy is
starting to
tail off a
little bit.
And sure,
we're all
rich already.
We're very,
very rich.
We have more
money than we
can spend in
our entire
fucking lifetimes
if we tried
to.
But we are
not willing to
accept a
falling rate of
return.
And when I say
falling rate of
return, I don't
mean going from
$15 million a
year to
nothing.
I mean going
from $15 to
$13.5.
half, that is
completely
unacceptable to
these people.
And so what
they decide is
we are basically
going to destroy
labor as a
social force
and we are to
the greatest
extent possible
going to try
to remove
anything to do
with economics,
with domestic
and social
economic policy
from the game
show called
Politics in
America.
Instead, what
we are going
to try to
do is present
the Democrats
as the
political class
of the
learned and
virtuous and
white-collar,
the smart ones,
the technocrats,
the smartest
guys in the
room.
That's what the
Democrats have
to be from
now on.
Because on
economic policy,
we are
completely going
to fall in
line with the
Republicans.
Because both
we, the rich
people talking,
and the
rich people
who pay
our fucking
bills for
the politicians
talking,
they're not
going to
accept any
sort of
falling rate
of profit.
So there
is going to
be this
mass shift
from an
America in
which, and
you think of
this in like
the late
50s, early
60s, how
fucking
unimaginable
this seems
now.
An America
in which you
could be a
goddamn milkman
or a garbage
truck driver.
And I am
not, by the
way, insulting
or belittling
either of those
kinds of
people.
Milkman and
garbage truck
drivers are way
more fucking
important than
senators are.
You could
drive a garbage
truck and have
three kids and
a wife, and
your wife didn't
need to work if
she didn't want
to or couldn't,
and you could
own a little
ranch-style
house, not just,
you know, have
a mortgage, you
could own it, and
you could buy a
new fucking Ford
or Buick every
few years, and
you had both
money and time to
go on vacation
every once in a
while, and if you
went to the
doctor because you
needed to have, you
know, a fucking
tooth pulled, it
was 25 bucks.
I mean, that was
real in this
country.
We actually did
have that.
It seems like
absolute delusional
fantasy.
fantasy now to
imagine that kind
of life, but we
had that fucking
kind of life for a
while, or at
least I should say
white people, and
not even all white
people, but a good
percentage of white
people had that
kind of life for a
while after World
War II, thanks in
some part to the
massive spending
entailed by the,
you know, new
post-war military
industrial complex.
That's definitely
part of it.
We can't leave
that out, but
also thanks to
essentially the
legacy of the
New Deal.
And now in the
late 70s with
this neoliberal
turn, we decide,
okay, rate of
profits falling just
a little bit.
Can't fucking have
that.
So we are going
to begin offshoring
all the blue
collar work we
can, all the
manual labor,
skilled or
unskilled, whatever
the fuck that
means.
There's no such
thing as unskilled
labor.
We're going to be
sending that to
what, you know,
then in the context
of the Cold War,
they would still
call third world
countries.
We're getting rid
of all that.
All the fucking
factories are
shutting down.
We're busting all
the unions.
We're cutting
everybody's benefits.
We are going to
usher in the era
of the private
equity leveraged
buyout in which
essentially somebody
like say Mitt
Romney at
Bain Capital
issues a bunch
of junk bonds
to raise the
money to buy
your corporation
and then buys
the corporation
and suddenly the
debt for those
junk bonds
becomes your
debt, your
corporation's
debt.
And so now
Mitt Romney
has the right
to completely
slash every
cuttable cost
at your company
and when it's
finally become
completely inert
and unworkable
and there are
no fucking
employees left,
then to sell
off all your
assets, your
stock holdings,
your machinery,
your real estate,
whatever, at a
profit.
That's going to be
sort of our
engine of economic
growth in the
United States now.
We are moving
from an economy
of making shit
to an economy
essentially of
financial
ledger domain,
of moving
around
units of
abstract value
in such a way
that the right
people get rich
and the right
people stay poor.
And we're
removing all
of that from
any political
discourse whatsoever
and now
politics in the
U.S.
in its game
show form
is going to be
about the
enlightened liberal
arts Democrats
versus the
dumb evangelical
Republicans.
That was
obviously its
first form.
Now it's taken
many different
forms since
that.
But essentially
of getting rid
of the New
Deal,
getting rid of
the whole concept
of organized
labor,
relocating all
that shit to
the cheapest
place possible,
financializing as
much of the
economy as
possible,
and turning
politics completely
into a battleground
for culture war.
Nothing about
social policy,
nothing about
economics,
nothing about
the very
structure of
how the
simplest things
are run in
this country,
and certainly
nothing about
what rights you
have just as a
human fucking
being.
No, no, no,
no, no, no,
no.
That's all gone.
That's, sorry,
the profit's
falling too
fast.
We have to
keep paying
out these
shareholders.
And so
there is this
moment, you
know, it
begins in the
late 70s,
but really I
would say sort
of culminates
in the early
and mid-90s
with Bill
Clinton and
the incredibly
just nightmarishly
awful package
of legislation
that that
child-molesting
son of a
bitch
manages to
put his
shoulder behind
and get
through Congress.
And so
we've got
NAFTA,
and we know
all about
NAFTA.
We have
basically gutting
the entire
welfare system.
We have
the new and
improved war
on drugs,
you know,
the crime
bill,
the Biden
crime bill.
We have
the Biden
counterterrorism
bill,
which gives
the U.S.
unprecedented
power of
surveillance on
people who
have never
been accused
of any
crime.
And we
have the
repeal of
the Glass-Steagall
Act passed
during the
fucking New
Deal,
which prevented
savings and
loans from
also being
investment banks.
The New
Deal is
gone.
It's fucking
over,
right?
And with
in particular
NAFTA
and with
the effective
end of
welfare,
I mean,
there is
still technically
a welfare
program in
this country,
but compared
to what it
was,
you know,
even 40
years ago,
it's a
fucking joke
now.
What we
have is a
whole group
of inconvenient
ass people
who are
poor and
who don't
have any
sort of
particularly
specialized
or elevated
education and
who,
you know,
if they
wanted to
go to
college,
would have
to go
into enormous
amounts of
fucking debt
for it that
they'll never
be able to
pay back
because,
of course,
this was also
right around
the same
time that
all these
state schools
that had
once been
tuition-free
start charging
money,
start operating
as for-profit
entities.
So we have
all these
kind of,
you hate to
say it,
but useless
humans in
places like
Kentucky,
Ohio,
Virginia,
Michigan,
Illinois,
Missouri,
you know,
all these
places where
the shit
you guys
used to
do,
we don't
need you
to do
that anymore
because now
someone is
doing your
job in a
fucking free
enterprise zone
two feet
over the
border into
Juarez and
we're paying
them 11 cents
an hour and
they can't
form a
fucking union.
The idea
that you
were going
to grow
up and
get your
dad's
union job
when he
retires,
no,
that's
absolutely
fucking
gone.
And we're
getting rid
of welfare
because we
frankly don't
have any
economic
incentive to
help you
people survive.
And so
the question
must be
asked,
at this
point,
you've got
this excess
population.
How do you
make money?
how do you
make a
profit off
people who
aren't generating
profit in
the conventional
ways, i.e.
by having
jobs that
paid livable
wages and
participating in
the economy?
The way you
do that is
by making
them drug
addicts and
especially
addicts to
the most
addictive
drugs we
know about,
which are
derivatives of
opium.
Like I
said,
every single
fucking
generation of
opiate or
opioid has
been passed
as,
this one's
safe,
this one's
not addictive,
don't worry,
we fixed all
the problems.
And that
was 100
fucking
percent how
they pushed
Oxycontin.
You know,
the painkiller
part of
Oxycontin is
not new at
all.
That shit has
been around
since the
20s or
30s,
Oxycodone,
which we
know because
fucking
Hitler took
it every
day.
Hitler took
daily
Eucodol
injections,
and Eucodol
is just
Oxycontin
without the
content part.
And content
refers to
continuous
release as
opposed to
being released
all at once,
right?
So the
claim was,
well,
this is
basically heroin
and a pill,
but because
it's released
continuously and
not all at
once,
you can't
get addicted
to it.
And people
at the
FDA,
people at
the DEA,
people at
the FDA,
you know,
anyone who
has any
fucking
connection,
no matter
how tangential
to medicine
or to drugs,
the fucking
National
Institutes of
Health,
anyone,
anyone who
had done
even the
tiniest
little bit
of research
would have
learned very
fucking
quickly,
no,
the content
part of
Oxycontin
does not
make it less
addictive,
not at all.
This shit
is in many
cases more
concentrated than
heroin.
This is going
to completely
destroy people's
lives.
And so the
fact that this
lie would have
been very,
very easy
to disprove
to me
suggests
they didn't
want it
disproven.
They knew
they were
lying.
And by
they,
I don't
just mean
Purdue
Pharmaceutical,
I mean
the FDA,
the DEA,
the Bureau
of fucking
Prisons who
have a very
strong interest
in this kind
of thing.
Interesting how
the for-profit
prison industry
really sort of
crops up at
the same
time as the
quote-unquote
opioid epidemic
begins.
Isn't that
funny?
All the
doctors who
pushed this
shit on
millions upon
millions of
patients,
they were
lying.
Now some
of them may
have been
too stupid
to know
that they
were lying,
but they
were absolutely
lying.
And between
the, you
know,
de-industrialization
and financialization
of the American
economy and
effectively the
end of the
welfare state
and the end
of the New
Deal and
then the
opioid epidemic
slicing in
right there,
I find it
very, very
difficult to
believe that
that was a
fucking coincidence,
that that was
just some
terrible accident
of history.
Because when
you've got
people who
are, you
know, in an
economic sense,
as the
omni ones
would put it,
useless, what
profit can you
generate out of
them?
What are
they good
for?
Well, if
you get
them addicted
to hyper-addictive
drugs, if
you do
everything you
can to
push the
most addictive
drugs known
to man onto
as many people
as you can
possibly find,
and let's not
forget, a lot
of these people
in the immediate
aftermath of
de-industrialization
would have been
people who
worked manual
labor for a
long time
and had
serious health
problems as
a result of
doing it,
including most
prominently chronic
pain.
So if you can
get all of
these people
addicted to
a drug,
they will do
anything,
anything,
anything to
not have to
quit.
If you get
these people
addicted to
something that
will make
them fucking
lie, cheat,
steal, kill
for their
next hit,
you can
turn them
into an
engine of
economic
activity.
These people
who are
worthless to
you any
other way,
you can
make them
customers of
the pharmaceutical
industry in
an entirely
new way.
What we
used to do
with heroin
and the
fucking French
connection and
the golden
triangle,
what we used
to do sort
of off books
for operations
we didn't
really want to
talk about,
now we can
do it
legit,
we can do
it mainstream,
all we have
to do is
push this
shit hard
enough and
you will
create the
ideal marginal
economic
actor,
which is to
say,
someone who
will do
absolutely
anything to
be able to
buy a pill
from you,
and then
when that
person is no
longer able to
buy the pill,
that person
dies.
it is a
self-solving
problem.
And so all
of these
unnecessary
human fucking
beings
suddenly become
great little
engines of
economic activity
because they
will buy and
buy and buy
and buy and
buy any
version of
opiates,
opioids,
heroin,
whatever,
as quickly as
they can,
as much as
they can,
for as long
as they can,
and then
they're either
going to run
out of money
and die,
or they're
going to get
killed doing
something they
were doing to
try to get
money and
die,
or they're
going to
overdose and
die.
And that
means the
precise moment
they become
useless to you
is the precise
moment you don't
have to worry
about them
anymore because
now they're
fucking dead.
And if you
look at how
rates of
things like
drug overdoses
and especially
opiate-related
drug overdoses
have risen over
the last even
10 but 20,
30 years,
that does not
suggest to me
a fucking
accident.
That suggests
to me
essentially
a
combination
basically
of a
multi-level
marketing scheme
and eugenics.
And if we
have learned
anything in
the past few
years about
the interests
of the
billionaires who
can do
whatever they
fucking want
in this world,
it's that they
are still very,
very into
eugenics.
That has never
passed.
They have simply
gone from one
pseudoscience to
another pseudoscience
and attempting to
determine proper
eugenic practices,
going from
fucking humorism
and physiognomy
and fucking
phrenology in
past centuries
to now claiming
that they can
read the genetic
code of two
potential partners
and tell you
whether those
partners will have
a poor or a
rich baby,
which is
completely fucking
insane.
And it's pretty
well documented
that with someone
like Bill Gates,
the vast majority
of his charitable
work, quote
unquote, in
places like
Africa, it's
not because he
cares about
Africans dying
of preventable
diseases.
He doesn't give a
shit about that.
It is, and I'm
not quoting
precisely here,
but paraphrasing,
it is so that
Africans will stop
having so many
babies because
now enough of
their babies
will die young
of preventable
disease that
they have lots
of children.
And so if we
can vaccinate
them against
those diseases,
they're going to
stop having so
many kids.
Bill Gates'
charitable
interest is in
reducing the
percentage of
Earth's population
that is in
Africa.
That is fucking
eugenics.
And you can
point from there
to Epstein,
to Elon Musk.
It's all the
same obsession
with determining
the demographic
outcome of the
future.
And one great
way to get,
you know,
these are people
who believe in
one way or
another a form
of predestination,
right?
And 250 years
ago is
predestination
based on the
shape of your
fucking skull.
I remember,
this is a complete
side note,
but I remember
once seeing a
1700s engraving
of faces that
matched different
sorts of
personalities
according to
humorism.
And humorism was
the idea,
I believe,
goes back to
Ibn Sina,
or Avicenna,
the golden age
Persian poet,
scientist,
astronomer,
one of those
guys who just
did everything,
that human
health and
human personality
are determined
by the balance
of four
humors,
as he called
them,
which are
blood,
yellow bile,
black bile,
and,
and,
oh fuck,
what's the last
one?
Blood,
yellow,
a collar.
And in some
of those,
you will see
yellow bile
described as
phlegm instead
of yellow bile.
But blood,
black and
yellow bile,
and collar.
And that,
for example,
is where we
get the word
sanguine,
meaning sort
of optimistic,
rosy colored,
because it was
thought that
people with
more blood
were more
optimistic.
This is also
where we get
the word
melancholy.
I believe
that
melancholy
is just
Greek for
black bile,
essentially.
This is where
we get the
word choleric,
to mean,
you know,
short-tempered
and angry,
because people
with too much
collar,
you know,
were supposedly
ill-tempered
and easy to
get a rise
out of.
The one
reason I
remember this
engraving is
because they
were showing
the kind of
face and
head shapes
that went
along with
these supposed
temperaments,
right?
And the
notes explained
that you
could recognize
a sanguine
person,
a naturally
happy person
whose predominant
humor was
blood,
by the fact
that he would
have a long,
long sloping
back forehead,
and then the
crown of his
head, the very
top, would be
very far back.
And I swear to
you, this
engraving of the
perfect sanguine
gentleman looked
exactly like
Roger Stone.
It's fucking
uncanny how much
it looks like
Roger Stone.
God.
But anyway,
the point here
is these
eugenicists have
believed in one
or another type
of determinism
of, you know,
depending on the
age, either
outright religious
or pseudo-medical
or genetic
Calvinism,
essentially.
That's the basis
of the whole idea
of eugenics.
And if the
world is run
in large part
by people who
seriously believe
that you can
predict the
financial outcome
of an unborn
child's life
by looking at
the genes of
its parents,
who cares if we
kill all the
junkies?
None of them
should be
reproducing anyway.
These junkies
aren't fit to
have children.
They're just
going to have
children who
are junkies.
Or something
worse.
No, no, no.
It's actually
a net good if
we get rid of
all these people.
Because remember,
Earth is going
to be overcrowded
way too soon.
And when people
talk about
overpopulation
and overcrowding,
they never talk
about the
percentages of
the burden on
Earth that are
borne by
different people.
For example,
the carbon
footprint of
the average
fucking American
versus the
carbon footprint
of the average
fucking Somali
that almost
nobody else on
Earth takes up
as many natural
resources and
kills the Earth
more on a
day-to-day basis
than a fucking
American does.
But we're always
worried about
overpopulation
somewhere else,
right?
So as long
as we want
to have the
finest genomes
to lead the
human race
into its future,
especially if
there's some
kind of
catastrophic
collapse,
we might as
well get rid
of all the
useless genetic
failures who
become
oxycontin
addicts,
heroin addicts,
opana addicts,
whatever.
Now, I am not
necessarily saying
that this
eugenic idea
was behind the
very beginning
of the opioid
epidemic in this
country,
although I think
it may well
have been.
I am saying
I think the
idea of a
eugenic
cleansing
is one of
the great
reasons that
this shit
is still
going on.
But that
is ideology.
And beneath
ideology on
the material
substratum,
there is the
unavoidable
fact that by
neoliberalizing
and financializing
the American
economy,
you just took
millions of
people out of
productive roles
and effectively
prevented them
from participating
in the economy.
So how do you
make them do it
again?
You give them,
as Thomas Pinchon
said,
inelastic demand.
You get them
addicted to
something that
they will do
anything to
keep taking it
because it is
such a fucking
nightmare to
stop.
And those
people will
keep making
that little bit
of money to
keep taking
their drug as
long as they
can, and then
one way or
another they're
going to die.
And that
squares the
circle.
That solves
the equation.
this truly
is what I
believe is
not necessarily
the initial,
you know,
I'm not talking
about people
in a smoky
boardroom or
whatever deciding
this in 1994,
but I think
this is the
essential nature
and thrust
of what we
call the
opioid epidemic.
that it is
basically about
taking people
who have
been
demonetized,
as it were,
squeezing the
last fucking
money out of
them you can
by getting
them addicted
to horrible
drugs, and
then allowing
them to die
when they
stop producing
any economic
value.
And some
people, I'm
sure, some
people would
hear that and
think it's,
unnecessarily
conspiratorial
and paranoid.
And maybe
even some
listeners of
this show
would think
that, and
I understand
that.
But I
want you to
think of
that basic
structure I'm
talking about,
of flooding
a de-industrialized
country with
opioids as
the last
true engine
of economic
movement
among the
poor, and
then consider
that both in
degree of
severity,
and in
degree of
complication,
next to a
couple other
things that
absolutely
documentably
have happened.
For example,
all the great
work that
Devin T. O'Shea,
who's been on
Truant on,
has done about
the Pruitt-Igoe
public housing
project, and
the fact, the
indisputable
fact, that the
poor black
people living in
these housing
projects were
used for
radiation
experiments by
the fucking
military, that
the U.S.
Army Chemical
Corps was
going into
these places
with radioactive
strontium, and
just sort of
seeing what
happened to
people there.
Strontium is
what is called
a calcium
analog.
An analog is
a substance
that will eat
away at
another substance,
and then fill
in exactly the
same shape.
So, strontium
as a calcium
analog can
often be found
in bones and
teeth of people
who have
suffered radioactive
exposure.
And they've
got 100,000
strontium-tainted
teeth of people
who have lived
in the Pruitt-Igoe
projects.
They were
outright just
testing radiological
weaponry on
poor black
people.
And then
when the
housing projects
began to fall
apart because
they were
effectively a
fucking weapons
testing range,
Pruitt-Igoe was
used, as Devin
did a great job
of describing,
as this
national example
of why we
shouldn't do
big social
projects anymore.
We shouldn't
have public
housing anymore.
This is key
to the rise
of that Reaganite
new right
in the late
60s to the
80s.
this idea
that every
social program,
no matter how
well-intentioned,
is doomed to
this kind of
dilapidation and
disgrace because
frankly, poor
people, by which
they often mean
black people,
they don't
deserve it and
they don't care
about it enough
and they're not
going to take
care of it.
It was a
fucking weapons
testing range.
And we all
know that
happened.
We all know
that happened.
is that
more or less
feasible than
simply flooding
a market with
opioids?
I would say
that's considerably
more complicated
than flooding a
market with
opioids and
letting people
generate economic
value until they
kill themselves.
Take another
one, and it's
impossible to get
into at very
much depth because
it's something so
complicated that I
don't know if any
living person fully
understands it, but
fucking Iran
contra and
especially the
crack element.
It is, again,
established fact
that for years
and years, the
CIA was funding
illegal wars,
particularly in
Nicaragua, by
trafficking cocaine
inside the United
States and that
when they realized
there was sort of a
built-in spending
limit on cocaine
because it was
very expensive
and even a
person with tons
of money can
only take so
much in a given
period, all of a
sudden, a new
kind of cocaine
appears that's
very cheap, that
lasts for, you
know, five, ten
minutes, and that
makes you then
immediately need
another hit.
And it was called
crack, and it
was disseminated to
ghettos, primarily
poor black inner
city neighborhoods
throughout this
fucking country.
There were people
with direct CIA
connections teaching
drug dealers how
to fucking cook
rock, all right?
And it turned
black inner city
neighborhoods in
many, if not most,
of the major cities
in fucking North
America into
goddamn war zones
for a decade and
a half at least.
You know, and it
turned the police,
this is the thing
perhaps more
responsible than
anything else, along
with Biden's crime
bill, for police
militarization.
It turned the
police into an
occupying fucking
army.
An occupying army
which was
incidentally led
in many of its
techniques by the
legendary Daryl
Gates, the top
cop in Los
Angeles.
He was the one
who, you know,
pioneered fucking
driving tanks
through the
fucking front
walls of
people's houses
because they
might allegedly
have a crack
rock somewhere
in the house.
Well, Daryl
Gates, it turns
out, was also
working for the
CIA that whole
time.
So what he was
doing was not
just, you know,
fucking occupying
black Los Angeles
as a warlord,
essentially.
He was also
testing out
CIA counterinsurgency
and crowd
control techniques
on helpless
fucking people
in that city.
Now, you tell
me, the
incredible web
of convolutions
that led to
Iran-Contra
going the way
it did and
the crack
epidemic happening
the way it
did, is that
more or less
plausible than
just flooding the
market with
opioids and
letting people
take them until
they die?
And now, I'm
going to tell
you the last
one of these
stories I have
and this is
the one I
might have
some trouble
getting through
but I'm going
to try.
Those of you
who have
listened to my
shows will
know about
the long,
long, long,
long history
of involvement
between IG
Farben, the
German chemical
and pharmaceutical
firm that
basically managed
World War II
for Germany
and people
who were either
in the CIA
or who would
become the
CIA, that
IG Farben's
stateside legal
counsel was
Alan fucking
Dulles, that
IG Farben's
stateside board
was made up
of people who
ran Ford and
General Motors
and Exxon.
I don't need to
go through all
that again.
Well, let me
tell you about a
particular IG Farben
executive.
It was a guy
named Otto
Ambrose.
He rose
through the
ranks at IG
Farben partly
because he
was one of
the four people
who collaboratively
invented sarin
gas and
Hitler thought
that was cool.
So, Hitler
made Otto
Ambrose his
personal chemical
warfare advisor
throughout the
war.
And,
and, I
said that
German,
and, in
that capacity,
Ambrose also
supervised the
construction and
operation of
slave factories,
including
Auschwitz-Monowitz,
the one at the
Auschwitz-Birkenau
death camp.
Interestingly,
the main thing
the Jewish
slaves were being
forced to produce
at that factory,
synthetic fuel,
the same
fucking
synthetic fuel
whose ingredients
and formula
were given
to the Nazis
by Standard Oil
and fucking
General Motors
in 1939.
Otto Ambrose,
after the war,
is convicted
at the Nuremberg
trials of
mass murder
and enslavement.
And then,
just a few years
later,
like everybody
else from
IG Farben,
Ambrose has
his sentence
commuted
by John
McCloy,
that motherfucker
I talked about
at great length
in the Farben
episodes.
McCloy,
who was in
charge of the
Japanese internment
policy during
World War II.
McCloy,
who was one of
the people,
along with
Alan Dulles
and Bill Donovan,
who basically
forced Harry
Truman's hand,
well,
that may be a
little too nice
to Harry Truman,
but who convinced
Harry Truman
that we needed
a peacetime
intelligence agency
that had
basically unlimited
power and thus
created the CIA.
This is the same
John McCloy
who was on the
fucking Warren
Commission.
All right?
And John McCloy,
as with every
other major
Farben executive
who got convicted
at Nuremberg,
McCloy,
when he takes
over as the
sort of main
American bureaucrat
in West Germany
after the war,
he lets all those
people out of prison.
Why?
Well,
first of all,
you know,
professionals,
noblesse oblige,
these are our
friends,
really,
but also,
we want them
working for us.
And so,
this fellow,
Otto Ambrose,
comes to the U.S.
for a while
and works for
Dow Chemical,
which might,
given the time
period,
make you think
about Korea
and then Vietnam,
think about
Agent Orange
and Napalm.
He also works
for the U.S.
Army Chemical
Corps
during the
same period
they're testing
radiological weapons
on black people
at the Pruitt-Igoe
homes in St. Louis.
I don't know
that he had
anything to do
with that project,
but
same employer,
same time.
And then he
goes back
to Germany
to get back
into the private
sector
in a big way.
and he
becomes
an executive
at a company
called
Chemie
Grunenthal.
And Chemie
Grunenthal
was
one of these
many instances
I talked
about
in the Farben
episodes
of Farben
being broken
up into
smaller corporations
that still
just essentially
worked as a
network
to keep
all of Farben's
patents
and processes
together.
And Chemie
Grunenthal,
it had existed
back in the
30s,
but it was a
fairly small
firm,
very much
a minor
satellite in
the orbit
of IG Farben.
Well,
now that
officially there
is no
IG Farben,
all these
smaller companies
come to the
fore because
they essentially
have to
reconstitute
IG Farben,
right?
Well,
Ambrose,
as one of
the executives
of Chemie
Grunenthal,
brings on
a guy named
Dr.
Heinrich
Mückter.
And Heinrich
Mückter
spent World
War II
doing something
that you
could even
convince yourself
sounds noble,
trying to find
a vaccine
for typhus.
Here's the
thing about
typhus,
though.
It can't
survive
outside of
a human
body.
You cannot
take a
culture of
typhus or
a sample
of typhus
and then
study it
in a lab,
or at least
you couldn't
in the
1940s.
The only
way to
study it
is in
situ
in a
living
human.
So,
Mückter
worked at
one of the
concentration
camps,
and he
injected
hundreds
and hundreds
of Jews
with typhus
and then
basically
played
bed against
time.
Can I
invent
something that
cures this
before they
die?
And no,
he couldn't.
He did
not invent
a typhus
vaccine.
But,
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.
His research
on this
typhus
vaccine
led to
him working
at
Kimi
Grunenthal
under
Otto
Ambrose,
and that
research
culminated
in a
drug called
thalidomide
you might
have heard
of.
Thalidomide
was presented
as a
miracle cure
for morning
sickness
for pregnant
women.
And,
you know,
morning sickness
is a real
severe problem.
It's not like
being annoyingly
nauseous.
It's,
some women
can die
of malnutrition
during pregnancy
because they
can't eat.
Sometimes fetuses
will die
or be horribly
malnourished
when they're born
because their
mothers couldn't
eat because they
were so sick.
So it's a
real problem.
And,
the fucking
Nazi
concentration
camp
typhus
vaccine
doctor
bends his
research
toward
this angle.
And it's,
it's not,
last I checked
this wasn't
completely proven
yet,
but it seems
very likely
that thalidomide
was something
he actually
invented by
accident
while trying
to create
a typhus
vaccine.
so he
takes thalidomide
to
Chemie
Grunentor
and fucking
Nazi
mass murderer
war criminal
Otto Ambrose
and from
1958
to 1962
they
sell that
shit to
millions of
women
all over the
world.
It's got
different trade
names in
49 countries.
They were
pushing this
shit like
fucking
Tylenol.
And then
by the
early 60s
it's,
it became
clear that
thalidomide,
whatever it
might do
for morning
sickness,
did some
other things
too.
It killed
about 80,000
people,
10,000 of
whom were
miscarriages
caused by
the drugs
and it
caused the
births of
about 20,000
horrifically
disfigured and
disabled babies
babies born
most commonly
without arms
or legs,
sometimes
without either,
babies with
no hands,
babies with
no legs,
pardon me,
babies with
no feet,
babies who
might, I
actually used
to know a
guy whose
mother took
thalidomide when
he was pregnant
and he had
one full
working leg,
one leg down
to the knee
that he could
walk with
a prosthesis
and then
no left
arm and
his right
arm was
only from
the shoulder
to the
elbow and
had a thumb
on the end
of it and
he had to
use a little
mechanical
grasper device
to pick
things up.
so these
20,000
babies are
born
limbless,
handless,
footless,
sometimes
completely deaf
and blind,
sometimes with
horrific brain
injuries,
with blood
clots,
with non-functioning
organs,
with nightmarish
deformations of
the spine.
I don't know
how many of
you are familiar
with the term
spina bifida.
It's one of
those things
that even
for me,
I don't know
if you should
look that up
if you don't
know what it
is.
If you do,
only look at
it for a
couple seconds
because there's
some things
that are too
fucking horrible
for human eyes.
Not that it's
a birth defect,
not that a
baby is horrible
for being
defective,
what a horrible
word,
no,
no,
no,
none of that.
No,
that someone
did this
to a baby
for fucking
profit.
And over
the following
decades,
after it
became clear
that thalidomide
was killing
tens of
thousands of
people and
deforming tens
of thousands
more,
Kimi
Grunenthal
fought like
hell to
avoid taking
any responsibility.
Their excuse
was that when
they started
selling thalidomide,
they didn't
know that
medicines taken
by pregnant
women could
affect unborn
fetuses.
1958.
That is a
bald-faced
fucking lie.
And they have
been forced to
pay out in a
few class action
lawsuits,
but very,
very,
very narrowly
defined,
right?
It's always,
you know,
600 people
who fit
these exact
criteria.
Never the
80,000 dead,
20,000 maimed,
and then the
millions of
people whose
lives were
horrifically
affected by
having those
dead people,
those maimed
people,
be their
wives,
their babies,
their loved
ones,
their children.
And despite
the payouts,
thalidomide,
in the years
that it was
prescribed,
made both
Otto Ambrose
and Heinrich
Mückter
enormously
wealthy.
And so,
we have a
drug here
that ruined,
I would say
at a conservative
estimate,
millions of
lives over
just four
years.
A drug
that if it
had been
either tested
at all,
or if its
manufacturer had
told the
truth about
testing it,
never,
ever would
have been
sent to
fucking
market,
ever.
It should
have been
fucking
thrown into
the center
of the
earth from
the moment
they discovered
it.
And the
reason this
happened is
that an
employee of
IG Farben,
who worked
with Alan
Dulles before
Dulles became
CIA director,
was let
out of
jail for
Nuremberg
war crimes
by the
guy who
started the
CIA,
John
McCloy,
because we
wanted him
to work
for U.S.
intelligence
and U.S.
military contracting
for a while.
And then he
joined up with
another Nazi
war criminal
who created
a nightmare
drug in
the process
of injecting
Jews with
typhus to
see if he
could save
them.
And they
made obscene
amounts of
money and
destroyed
obscene
amounts of
lives and
nothing ever
happened to
them.
now if
you think
that is
more
far-fetched
than the
idea of
just flooding
a market
with opioids
to get
rid of
useless
people,
you're
completely
right.
It's
infinitely
more
far-fetched.
It's 30
years of
historical
development to
make this
happen,
and yet
it did
happen.
It
absolutely
happened.
So if
that's
more
unrealistic
than what
I'm proposing,
and it's
also 100%
true,
well,
you can
draw your
own
conclusions.
well,
I grew up in the
client state of a
petro king with a
complicated take
on things like
human rights,
but baby,
that's the
sacrifice
for bringing
joy
to the
world.
world.
And I learned
young how the
West was
one with
Christ,
big heart,
and a bigger
gun.
It wasn't
enough,
so we took
the moon,
cause
Nazi rock,
it's science
too,
can bring
joy
to the
world.
Warm drugs,
this righteous
cause,
to clear our
streets of
criminals,
now civilized
by an opioid,
so the
Sackler family
can enjoy
spreading
joy
around
the
world.
New York
City,
the world
loves you
when
retribution's
surely due
for the
zealots
who brought
you hell,
boy,
the heroes
and Langley
taught them
well
how to
infiltrate
joy
into
the
world.
Can't we
all just
get along
like Amazon
and
Raytheon
coming
together
to make
a drone
to bring
us lunch
and kill
the sons
in a
city
just
a
two-for-one
holistic
joy
to the
world
please
stop
resisting
all the
joy
in
your
world
just
a car
full of
celebrities
singing
about
the
joy
in
your
boat
string of
bad luck
in this
final turn
we gathered
around
watched our
cities burn
who could have
possibly predicted
this
said everyone
so we
both
live
and
turn to
the
black
guided
by
a
grand
soundtrack
we'll
liberate
some foreign
stars
and stick a flag
on the face
of Mars
the
the
the
the
period
starting
again
your
patience
zero
and original
sin
the mantra
rings across
the land
how clever
look at us
we've done it
again
we're bringing
joy
to whole
new
worlds
you must admit
we've certainly
got a knife
for bringing
joy
to whole
new
worlds
the time
these aliens
wound
all out
the joy
will bring
the whole
new
worlds
they're
bringing
joy
to
your
world
you
better
hope
you don't
have
cheap
bananas
or ice
we're
bringing
joy
to
your
world
you better
hope
you don't
have
dead
dinosaurs
we're
bringing
joy
to
your
world
world
you better
hope
you don't
have
big
plans
or else
we'll
bring
in
