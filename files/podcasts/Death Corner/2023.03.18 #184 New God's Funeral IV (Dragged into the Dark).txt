I started as a salesman, Mr. Beale.
I sold sewing machines and automobile parts, hairbrushes and electronic equipment.
They say I can sell anything.
I'd like to try to sell something to you.
You have meddled with the primal forces of nature, Mr. Beale, and I won't have it!
Is that clear?
Do you think you've merely stopped a business deal?
That is not the case.
The Arabs have taken billions of dollars out of this country, and now they must put it back!
It is ebb and flow, tidal gravity.
It is ecological balance.
You are an old man who thinks in terms of nations and peoples.
There are no nations.
There are no peoples.
There are no Russians.
There are no Arabs.
There are no third worlds.
There is no West.
There is only one holistic system of systems.
One vast and imane, interwoven, interacting, multivariate, multinational dominion of dollars.
Petrodollars, electrodollars, multidollars, reichmarks, rims, rubles, pounds, and shekels.
You get up on your little 21-inch screen and howl about America and democracy.
There is no America.
There is no democracy.
There is only IBM and ITT and AT&T and DuPont, Dow, Union Carbide, and Exxon.
Those are the nations of the world today.
All right.
Now, I got something that I need to read you.
Something.
Because all of these episodes in this series revolve around something I need to read you.
Hopefully in a comprehensible way.
But before I do that, I just have to say, I have to note how fucking amazing it is that Paddy Chayefsky managed to get the word imane into that monologue.
And perhaps even more than that, that Ned Beatty managed to carry it off without making it sound like, you know, this out-of-context clanger.
I think it might be the only movie I've ever seen that contains the word imane.
And I'm going to make a distinction here because it's actually important for something I'll be talking about in a minute.
Imane is the generalized form of the adjective iminent, spelled I-M-M-A-nant.
And there are at least three different kinds of the word iminent, right?
There is the E-M-I kind, which means, you know, authoritative, looming large, a respected figure or event in a given field.
Or consequential, at least, if not necessarily respected.
That's one kind of iminent.
There's also I-M-M-I-nant, which means something that is going to happen soon.
Something, like Stephen, Stephen Dedalus would put it, ineluctable.
I guess he got that from Aristotle.
Something, something that is inexorable.
And then I-M-M-A-nant, that is the one from which the word imane is drawn.
And within philosophy and theology as well, imme-M-A-nant is the opposite of transcendent.
Which is to say, in a transcendent system of belief, whatever sort of belief that might be,
you believe that the real world, the real truth, you know, the platonic forms, God, whatever you want to call it,
however you want to classify it, you believe that there is some real sort of, you know, echelon of existence
beyond the one in which we live now.
And in immanentism, philosophically or theologically, immanent means the opposite of that.
It means there is no other realm, there is no other life, there is no place from which, you know,
this existence suddenly makes sense.
Our lives, our world, they are not leading to anything.
They don't have some vast teleological purpose.
They are what they are.
And all of reality is here, accessible to us right now, if we learn how to experience it.
And I think it's very consequential, for reasons I will get to later, that Ned Beatty describes capitalism,
global capitalism, as a vast and imane system of systems.
Because in calling it imane, what Ned Beatty is doing, what Patty Chayefsky was doing,
is to make the philosophical admission that this system of global capitalism,
it is not pushing toward some kind of further goal.
It is not merely the process by which we arrive at some form of truth or good or even just reality.
There is no product of it.
It is imane.
It is self-contained.
This is all there is.
The way he compares it to, you know, ecology and tidal gravity,
that this is a closed system and it does not exist for any purpose except to keep itself moving.
And this makes me think, I may have mentioned this on the show before,
but I think Marshall McLuhan in general is a pretty badly understood figure.
I'm not, you know, co-signing everything he ever said, but his, you know, central and most famous dictum,
that the medium is the message.
People don't get what that means.
They read medium or hear medium.
And they think it refers specifically to something like music, painting, sculpture, television, film, whatever.
And the conclusion they draw from this is, you know, the point of a movie is that it's a movie, right?
And that is, that's true in a pretty narrow sense for what McLuhan was talking about.
But if you actually read the book that that is from, McLuhan repackaged essays and stuff in different books all the time.
So I don't know what the easiest source for this would be these days.
But I found that, that essay in a book called Understanding Media.
And McLuhan's point is that a medium, and we're not talking about artistic media,
or rather we're not only talking about artistic media.
When he says medium, he means any kind of structure or system that ostensibly is there to convey some kind of information to someone on the other end,
which could be anything from news film to the printing press to human speech.
But it can also go way beyond that into things like politics, economics, foreign policy, history.
And the point of saying the medium is the message is to say, to choose the example of politics.
The point of politics is not to change anything, do anything, make anything better,
except insofar as it ensures the survival of politics.
The point of politics is to keep politics going.
It does not have a telos.
It doesn't have an end point.
It's not working toward anything.
There is no eschatology of politics in which somehow all of this bullshit will either prove to have been worth it,
or, you know, in the probably more realistic version, prove to have been wrong the entire time and we're all going to hell.
No, no, no, no, no.
It's not geared toward anything.
Politics exists to keep politics alive.
That's what it's there for.
That's the only thing it's there for.
And I remember first reading McLuhan right around the time Obama got elected,
and I was never a believer in Obama.
I, in 2008, felt like I kind of had to vote for him because the idea of a McCain-Palin White House was just,
especially after George W. Bush, not something I could conscience.
But I never really bought Obama.
And I remember reading McLuhan right around the time Obama got elected the first time,
and it hitting me like a fucking sock full of nickels,
that if you were just elected president of the United States,
arguably the single most powerful person in the world, at least on paper,
if a political system made you the president,
why would you want to change anything about that system?
It already works for you.
It did what you wanted it to do.
And sure, I mean, we can talk in sort of sentimental terms about service to the constituency and so forth,
but I think Barack Obama showed as thoroughly as anyone else ever has
that he didn't mean a goddamn fucking thing he said for that entire campaign,
and he made the correct bet that he could go on doing that
and win re-election and then become this,
it's not exactly an Ã©minence grise,
but this kind of pop culture figure now, basically,
because his essential thrust in keeping politics alive
was to get rid of as much of the actual policy as possible.
Don't do anything unless you absolutely have to to save the political system.
Other than that, what you do is transpose the supposed realm of politics
into the realm of pop culture.
And this way, we can continue having just completely mind-numbing culture wars
for the rest of human history,
while politics, actual politics, gets worse and worse and worse,
but digs itself in so far via that getting worse
that there's really no way to extract it.
The medium lives forever.
And you'll see why I'm mentioning these things a little bit later on,
but now I have to do the reading that this was supposed to start with.
I'm currently holding the book upside down.
Let me change it here.
This is from Gravity's Rainbow,
and it's from very near the end,
in which Gottfried, the basically sex slave of Weissmann or Blicero,
who, you know, if the book has a villain, it's Blicero.
When Gottfried is with Weissmann near the end of the book,
when it appears that Weissmann is dying.
And if you've read the book, you know it's not as simple as Weissmann dying.
You know, don't look in Germany.
Look in the United States.
Look high, not low.
But anyway, Gottfried at this point is under the impression Weissmann is dying
and is starting to get the idea that maybe all of this, you know,
bizarre, masochistic, sexual shit has been leading towards some kind of,
some sort of conclusion.
And so this is Gottfried listening to Weissmann.
And sometimes I dream of discovering the edge of the world,
finding out that there is an end.
My mountain gentian always knew,
but it has cost me so much.
America was the edge of the world.
A message for Europe, continent-sized, inescapable.
Europe had found the site for its kingdom of death,
that special death the West had invented.
Savages had their waste regions, Kalaharis,
lakes so misty they couldn't see to the other side.
But Europe had gone deeper,
into obsession, addiction,
away from all the savage innocences.
America was a gift from the invisible powers,
a way of returning, but Europe refused it.
It wasn't Europe's original sin.
The latest name for that is modern analysis.
But it happens that subsequent sin is harder to atone for.
In Africa, Asia, Amerindia, Oceania,
Europe came and established its order of analysis and death.
What it could not use, it killed or altered.
In time, the death colonies grew strong enough to break away,
but the impulse to empire,
the mission to propagate death,
the structure of it, kept on.
Now we are in the last phase.
American death has come to occupy Europe.
It has learned empire from its old metropolis,
but now we have only the structure left us.
None of the great rainbow plumes,
no fittings of gold,
no epic marshes over alkali seas.
The savages of other continents,
corrupted but still resisting in the name of life,
have gone on despite everything.
While death and Europe are separate as ever,
their love's still unconsummated.
Death only rules here.
It has never, in love, become one with.
Is the cycle over now,
and a new one ready to begin?
Will our new edge,
our new death kingdom,
be the moon?
I dream of a great glass sphere,
hollow and very high and far away.
The colonists have learned to do without air.
It's vacuum inside and out.
It's understood the men won't ever return.
They are all men.
There are ways for getting back,
but so complicated,
so at the mercy of language,
the presence back on earth is only temporary
and never real.
Passages out there are dangerous,
chances of falling,
so shining and deep.
Gravity rules all the way out to the cold sphere.
There is always the danger of falling.
Inside the colony,
the handful of men have a frosty appearance,
hardly solid,
no more alive than memories,
nothing to touch.
Only their remote images,
black and white film images,
grained,
broken year after hoarfrost year,
out in the white latitudes,
an empty colony,
with only infrequent visits
from the accidentals like me.
Now, obviously,
you are talking about a Nazi talking about the moon
as the new kingdom of death.
I'd take it if you've been listening to this show
for any length of time,
you don't really need me to expand on that a whole lot.
The liberal absorption of fascism and Nazism in particular
in order to serve its own interests
and become an empire after World War II,
essentially.
But,
I bring this passage up for several reasons,
and one of them is
that
if you have ever been involved
in a grand artistic project,
whatever that means,
and let me be,
let me be clear.
When I say artistic project,
I don't necessarily mean,
you know,
making something.
I used to know what art meant,
and now the entire world tells me that I'm wrong,
but I'll tell you what art means to me,
in one sense,
is that,
sure,
there's writing a book,
there's making a movie,
there's listening to music,
or rather,
I should say,
there is writing music,
performing music,
but it is at least as much an artistic act
to read a book really well,
to see a movie really well,
to listen to music really well,
as it is to create them,
and anyone who's ever been,
you know,
involved in some sort of series,
artistic practice,
knows that,
you know,
with a very few freak exceptions,
your ideas,
your source material,
they don't just appear to you out of the blue,
not the vast majority of the time.
I have,
over the course of my life,
I have dreamed
probably about 10 or 15 songs,
and I have a handful of them,
that I was able to,
wake up and record,
before I forgot them,
but other than that,
you get a book,
from other books,
you get a movie,
from other movies,
you get music,
from other music,
the entire point,
of the artistic practice,
is that,
you take this little thing,
from over there,
and that little thing,
from over here,
and then you smash them together,
the particle accelerator,
right,
and you,
see how in combination,
they transmute,
how they alchemize,
and then you've got a starting point,
to work out from,
where you can take,
these things,
you borrowed,
transform them,
and then work out,
the extrapolations,
of what they could be,
what they could do,
that's what being an artist is,
and anyone who reads a book,
really well,
is no less an artist,
than anyone who writes a book,
really well,
they really can't be,
separated at all,
but I say this to say,
that if you have ever been,
deeply engaged,
in any artistic practice,
on whatever side of the coin,
you will probably be familiar,
with the phenomenon,
of suddenly the world,
seeming to relate,
everything to that practice,
on your behalf,
I've never bought a car,
never owned a car,
I actually don't know,
how to drive a car,
but people have told me,
that this is referred to sometimes,
as the new car phenomenon,
that when you're thinking,
about buying a new car,
you start seeing that car,
everywhere,
right,
because it's,
it was always there,
you just didn't have a reason,
to pay attention to it,
and in the same way,
when you get seriously deep,
into any kind of artistic project,
you will start noticing things,
you never had a reason,
to notice before,
and at the very best,
and also most insane end,
you know,
the best kind of insanity there is,
you can feel,
and I will always remember,
the first couple times,
I read Gravity's Rainbow,
watching this happen to myself,
you can feel,
very distinctly,
the book is reality,
the book is the real world,
I spend most of my time,
living in a fake world,
I've been in a fake world,
since I was born,
and I only just happen to find,
reality in this book,
and now,
little,
little signs are coming through,
I'm noticing things,
I've never noticed before,
my attention has been,
so thoroughly restructured,
that,
now it seems like,
rather than Gravity's Rainbow,
being a book in the world,
it seems like,
the world is a fiction,
within Gravity's Rainbow,
you know what I'm talking about,
I think,
Philip K.
Dick,
and the man in the high castle,
and I'm not referring,
to the fucking Netflix show,
whatever bullshit that was,
but the actual book,
you know,
that is what,
this is about essentially,
it theoretically takes place,
in an alternate timeline,
where the Axis won World War II,
but then these people,
discover a book,
of what is presented,
as alternate history,
science fiction,
what if the allies had won,
but as they start,
getting involved with the book,
little bits of reality,
start changing around them,
the you know,
freeway overpasses disappear,
streets don't cross,
where they used to,
buildings vanish,
and they are forced to come,
to the you know,
schizophrenic essentially,
conclusion,
that somehow,
in some way,
the world in the book,
is right,
and this world is wrong,
and that's one of the you know,
sort of the founding principles,
of Philip K.
Dick's own,
very personal strange brand,
of Gnosticism,
and I think you can,
I think you can,
access this phenomenon,
if you want to,
by getting seriously,
into anything,
for a long period of time,
this also happened to me,
with Frank Zappa's music,
and Zappa was,
very deliberate,
about this,
he was a combination,
of extremely deliberate,
and extremely spontaneous,
that you only find,
I think in the very,
very best art,
and,
Zappa referred to,
this,
this phenomenon,
in a number of ways,
and by the way,
just as an aside,
to all the people,
who have asked,
when are you going to do,
the Zappa episode,
and all the people,
who have said,
you're never going to do it,
are you,
I'm going to fucking do it,
I'm going to fucking do it,
it's going to be part of this series,
you will fucking see,
but anyway,
Zappa referred to this idea,
in a number of different ways,
he called it,
conceptual continuity,
he called it,
the project,
slash object,
and my favorite one,
the one that makes,
most sense to me,
he called it,
the output macro structure,
and there's a very early,
I think it was an essay,
he wrote in a magazine,
maybe,
around 69,
70,
somewhere around there,
where he talks about,
the idea of,
the output macro structure,
that,
what he is doing,
in his work,
is taking everything he can,
from the world,
right around him,
and then,
you know,
transmuting that,
into his art,
and there is no piece of information,
too trivial,
there is no allusion,
too trashy,
you know,
there is no story,
too distasteful,
or obscene,
to make it into his work,
and,
he would make,
these callbacks,
throughout the course,
of his entire career,
he was always mixing,
different recordings,
either of the same song,
or of different pieces,
in fact,
if you go back,
you know,
this is going to be a little,
inside baseball,
but,
if you go back to,
Inca Roads,
maybe my favorite,
Zappa piece,
on the album,
One Size Fits All,
well,
the,
beginning of that,
before the guitar solo,
and the end of that,
after the guitar solo,
were all recorded,
in a,
a,
a,
great studio,
in Colorado,
in 1974,
the guitar solo,
however,
is taken from,
a live performance,
in 1974,
that he then,
added into the middle,
of the song,
and he would do,
this sort of,
this sort of thing,
all the time,
I don't want to get,
too deep into it,
right here,
because,
you know,
that's stuff,
for the Zappa show,
but,
you know,
he would write a song,
in 1965,
and then,
in 1982,
in the middle,
of a completely different song,
with a completely different band,
he would suddenly,
bring in,
a verse,
from a 17 year old song,
and so,
it gives his,
his entire output,
as he,
as he said,
conceptual continuity,
it makes you feel,
that,
you are,
whether you know it or not,
you are living in,
as he put it,
the output macro structure,
your whole world,
has actually been,
inside of this music,
you just didn't know,
nobody told you,
nobody directed you,
to look at it,
and,
that is,
his work,
you know,
utilizes that technique,
all the time,
but it is also,
in large part,
about that technique,
and to me,
it's,
the combination of,
of,
deliberation,
and spontaneity,
and,
the ability to,
create,
a world,
within the world,
that is,
every bit as real,
as anything else,
that to me,
is one of the works of a,
or one of the hallmarks,
rather,
of a great artist,
I was fortunate enough,
to have,
a couple years,
of,
of correspondence,
with a,
really,
really brilliant,
English poet,
a guy named,
John Wilkinson,
fascinating guy,
very smart,
he still sends me,
a Christmas card,
every year,
even though,
we haven't really,
talked much,
but,
he referred to this thing,
I'm talking about,
as,
a,
contrafactual,
or,
counterfactual,
and that word is,
sort of,
difficult to apply,
in a,
in an American,
English,
context,
because most of the time,
here,
when people say,
counterfactual,
or,
contrafactual,
they are talking about,
like,
alternate history stuff,
basically,
that,
you know,
what if this had happened then,
and then where would we be now,
and that's not what John,
is talking about at all,
he is talking about,
a,
taking all the materials,
of reality,
available to you,
and via,
in his case,
language,
poetry,
alchemizing them,
into,
a,
connected,
but different,
but also,
completely real,
world,
and he pointed to,
Dylan Thomas,
as a master of this,
that,
you know,
Dylan Thomas is,
he's probably inspired,
more terrible poetry,
than,
than anyone,
but Shakespeare,
it's not his fault,
it's just that,
Dylan Thomas was,
a,
once in a civilization,
genius,
in an incredibly,
particular way,
and people who try to,
rip him off,
are generally very bad,
but every,
Dylan Thomas poem,
is made of things,
of a reference,
of,
of objects,
of ideas,
that you are,
perfectly familiar with,
that are real,
in every sense of the word,
real,
but that,
are,
now combined,
into a,
completely new,
and completely,
unforeseeable,
thing,
that changes,
all of its contents,
you know,
this is something,
I,
I look for,
in,
every artist,
that I really admire,
and,
the reason I say this,
well,
I just wanted to talk about it,
first of all,
but the reason I say this,
now,
is that,
I had this episode,
planned,
for,
most of a couple weeks,
I knew what I wanted to do next,
after the last one,
and it was going to be,
about the concept,
of abstraction,
and value,
and,
how,
pure,
abstracted value,
is,
uh,
liable,
to,
catastrophic collapse,
and then a few days ago,
Silvergate,
and Silicon Valley Bank,
crashed,
and then Signature Bank,
in New York,
crashed,
and,
uh,
I was talking about,
as I have talked about,
if you,
if you follow me on Twitter,
you will know,
uh,
my fear,
and it's really,
I'm not trying to be like,
ahead of the pack here,
I'm really fucking afraid,
that,
um,
the contagion,
of tech bullshit,
like crypto,
is going to,
turn out to have been,
so,
endemic,
to the system,
so embedded,
in the way things work now,
that,
I,
personally,
am,
am,
am,
am,
really worried,
about a,
2008 level,
global financial crisis,
because it doesn't take,
you know,
all that many people,
investing in crypto,
it only takes,
a lot of money,
from a few people,
who have,
a lot of money,
in other places,
right,
uh,
who have,
accounts with,
all sorts of banks,
to expose those banks,
to the hazard,
of a tech crash,
and I suspect,
unfortunately,
we are quickly,
going to learn,
that,
a whole lot,
of financial institutions,
who are considered,
you know,
old,
and venerable,
and trustworthy,
whether they were,
directly speculating,
in,
the general world,
I would just call it,
of tech bullshit,
which includes crypto,
uh,
whether it was them,
directly,
or whether it was,
their clientele,
there is so,
there's going to be,
a huge,
liquidity crunch,
that,
that could,
uh,
possibly bring down,
a lot of the economy,
and,
when I said this,
uh,
online,
about,
about SVB,
and Silvergate,
signature hadn't even,
happened yet,
uh,
someone said to me,
yeah,
sure,
I mean,
in this case,
but you know,
these are sort of,
specialist institutions,
and,
you know,
we,
we really don't have any reason,
to think that,
this is,
you know,
underlying a major part,
of the broader global market,
and I said,
uh,
yeah,
I guess not so far,
but,
if we see,
Bank of America,
or JPMorgan Chase,
or,
Deutsche Bank,
or,
Credit Suisse,
suddenly go under,
we will know,
we are in fucking,
trouble,
and now,
a couple days later,
Credit Suisse is going,
under,
um,
you will see,
this,
this is an interesting way,
to tell,
whether,
um,
your news sources,
are bullshitting you,
or not,
uh,
the bullshitters,
are going to say,
well,
Credit Suisse,
has,
uh,
it's been steadily,
losing value,
uh,
since 2003,
and that is technically,
true,
but,
what those people,
won't tell you,
is that,
yes,
over 20 years,
Credit Suisse,
has now lost,
94% of its value,
which is fucking amazing,
to say about,
a financial institution,
that entrenched,
but,
within,
those,
20 years,
it lost,
about,
7% of its value,
in,
uh,
the first 15,
and then,
87% of its value,
in just,
the last,
the last,
four,
right around the time,
all this,
crypto,
gambling,
tech,
bullshit,
blockchain,
NFT,
fucking nonsense,
comes along,
and now,
uh,
they are,
Credit Suisse,
is now not getting backstopped,
by the Saudi Sovereign Wealth Fund,
because,
if they own,
any more of the bank,
than they already do,
they are suddenly,
going to be subject,
to,
much,
stricter,
regulations,
and,
this is the,
initial thing,
I wanted to talk about,
with,
um,
suddenly,
some very timely,
examples,
the concept,
of,
abstraction,
of value,
and how it is,
the,
the,
contagion,
of that abstraction,
is,
built,
into the core,
of the,
imperial project,
basically,
and,
um,
look,
I know the words,
imperial,
and imperialist,
and colonial,
and,
and,
and,
colonist,
and,
are all very,
sloppily,
badly,
overused,
right now,
you know,
I,
I don't,
I don't,
ever need to hear,
anyone talking,
ever again,
about how,
you know,
Marvel,
or whoever the fuck,
can,
uh,
decolonize,
Spider-Man,
I don't give a shit,
but,
but,
the word empire,
is really,
the,
only word here,
I mean,
we are,
we live,
those of,
those of you who are Americans,
we live in the imperial core,
and,
there is,
something very definite,
to be both,
observed,
and predicted,
about what happens,
in the imperial core,
which is to say,
that,
the concept,
of value,
gradually,
becomes,
so abstract,
that,
almost,
entire,
globe-spanning,
economies,
can be run,
upon the,
abstract,
manipulation,
of value,
that was already,
abstract,
that is itself,
already,
an abstraction,
from,
the,
you know,
tranching,
together,
of various,
supposedly,
really valuable,
other things,
except,
a lot of those,
are strictly abstract,
value two,
and you never,
actually hit bottom,
there,
there,
there is,
there is,
there is no,
fucking,
lake floor,
to stand upon,
it just goes down,
and down,
and down,
forever,
and,
I am,
I am an,
etymology,
freak,
as you have probably,
guessed by this point,
and,
I have talked,
many times on here,
about how,
all words,
all language,
both,
spoken,
and written,
eventually,
if you go,
deep enough,
they are all,
metaphors,
metaphor,
is the basis,
of human language,
and,
any concept,
no matter how,
abstract,
which is one,
I am about to get to,
has roots,
in a,
very direct,
physical,
experiential,
metaphor,
metaphor,
the word,
abstract,
comes from a combination,
of two words,
ab,
as in,
away from,
or descending from,
or coming out of,
and,
trajere,
which means,
to drag,
so,
that which is abstract,
is literally,
dragged away,
it is dragged away,
from itself,
and,
there are,
a number of ways,
you could choose,
to interpret that metaphor,
and,
I don't know what,
you know,
contemporaries,
of the coinage,
of that word,
would have thought,
but,
whatever I,
whenever rather,
I think of,
the concept of,
abstraction,
as being dragged away,
I always imagine,
the same thing,
which is that,
you have something,
or someone,
real,
then you put,
an abstract,
placeholder,
where that person,
or thing was,
and then you take,
the real personal thing,
person,
or thing,
and you drag it off,
into the woods,
to fucking murder it,
that is what,
abstraction means,
and,
has long,
meant to me,
being,
dragged away,
from reality,
so that your value,
can persist,
while you,
are actually,
being fucking,
disassembled,
deep in the woods,
like Nick Cave,
and the Bad Seeds,
or no,
wait,
that was the birthday party,
but,
you get the idea,
and,
this is,
this is,
this is,
this is not just an accident,
that empires work this way,
right,
it is,
it is,
a,
a form of,
both centripetal,
and,
uh,
centrifugal force,
really,
more one than the other,
which is to say that,
any,
any nation,
kingdom,
whatever,
with,
the,
aspirations,
to empire,
will eventually focus,
its imperial aspirations,
upon,
places,
where you can find,
basically,
one,
or both,
of two things,
number one,
natural resources,
number two,
a subject population,
that can be,
either,
forced,
into working,
at resource extraction,
you know,
at the butt of a gun,
or via,
a mass institutionalized system,
of slavery,
or,
who can just be paid,
so little,
that it,
essentially,
makes no dent,
in the checkbook,
of the imperial power,
and the natural,
path of this,
is toward,
abstraction,
in the imperial core,
it,
it is the,
centrifugal spin out,
of any,
actual value,
into,
imperial holdings,
right,
because,
those are the places,
that have the resources,
because God knows,
we burn through ours,
as quick as we fucking could,
and,
those are the places,
that have the labor,
you either,
don't have to pay at all,
or you have to pay,
so little,
that it,
it really doesn't affect you,
in any way,
and this means,
the,
the,
economic,
and the whole,
not just economics,
in the textbook sense,
but the whole,
political economy,
of the imperial core,
comes to be,
about abstraction,
about dragging you,
into the fucking woods,
it,
it,
deals,
abstractly,
with abstract value,
and the layers,
of abstraction,
put upon,
that initial,
supposed value,
are,
never ending,
trading,
you know,
first,
there's,
banks give mortgages,
people pay them back,
then there's,
someone betting on,
whether or not,
the people will pay,
the mortgages back,
then there is,
someone,
betting on,
combining,
a bunch of mortgages,
into,
CDOs,
and betting,
whether on balance,
people will pay them back,
and then,
there,
there's a whole,
other stratum,
of people,
who are,
gathering,
these CDOs,
into various kinds,
of even larger,
financial derivative,
instruments,
who are betting,
on the ultimate worth,
of those,
and of course,
none of this,
actually goes,
according to the,
supposed dictates,
of free market capitalism,
ever,
ever,
because,
in a situation,
like the 2008 crisis,
you had,
on the one hand,
the people,
at the root of it,
you know,
the mortgage,
lenders,
would be a very,
be a very,
euphemistic,
and polite term,
they,
of course,
realized pretty quickly,
that,
these mortgages,
are being packaged,
into bonds,
and bet upon,
so it is in their interest,
to fling,
as many mortgages,
as possible,
at as many people,
as possible,
and lie about,
what that means,
and how it works,
every fucking day,
for the rest of time,
because,
who cares,
it's not,
we're not making our money,
off mortgage payments anymore,
we're making our money,
off derivatives trading,
related to the mortgage market,
right,
so,
who fucking cares,
if they compare it,
but,
as long as we can flip the shit,
before the money comes due,
we are fine,
so that's on the one end,
and on the other end,
all of these people,
who are speculating,
on the value,
of derivatives,
of derivatives,
of derivatives,
of derivatives,
they are all,
going to,
people like,
Standard and Poor's,
and,
bribing,
officials there,
to,
overrate,
the value of,
all of these bets,
they are making,
to overrate the value,
of the,
the underlying bonds,
that have been,
you know,
built up into CDOs,
and so forth,
none of this progresses,
as simply,
an actual,
bet on a bet,
on a bet,
on a bet,
because,
everyone,
at every level,
is trying to,
bribe,
and slither,
and fucking scramble,
their way out of,
what if this goes wrong,
and also,
doing the same thing,
to,
get,
you know,
people who are supposedly,
responsible,
regulators,
and so forth,
to vastly,
overrate the value,
of their assets,
so they can sell,
these fucking things,
while they're overrated,
and whoever ends up,
holding the fucking bag,
hey,
your problem,
right,
and,
for us,
in this,
Silicon Valley bank collapse,
you know,
I,
I'm not going to belabor,
the economic fine points,
of it too much,
because,
A,
other people are doing that,
and,
and B,
I am not,
an economist,
socialist,
but,
this is a situation,
in which,
this bank,
was specifically,
part of a class,
of banks,
called,
stadium banks,
that were,
they were created,
as a class,
with,
an amendment,
to the Dodd-Frank Act,
and I believe,
2018,
at the behest of,
or rather,
at the,
you know,
the,
parliamentary instigation,
of,
it wasn't his idea,
the unbelievably named,
Senator Mike Crapo,
and,
the Crapo bill,
was essentially,
to create,
this buffer zone,
in the world,
of bank regulation,
right,
so you got,
little small,
savings and loan banks,
that,
they're not,
subjected,
to the same kind,
of scrutiny,
and stress testing,
that huge banks are,
right,
and then,
above a certain limit,
you have to be,
willing to put the bank,
through stress tests,
to prove,
hey,
if everything went wrong,
for 30 days,
will this bank still work,
or are you going to,
completely crash,
you have to,
if you are making,
certain,
very risky,
financial decisions,
you have to,
take on,
the label,
of a systemic risk,
you have to admit,
to whoever's coming to you,
look,
you could make,
a lot of money here,
but you could also,
fucking lose,
every penny of it,
and that's not on us,
that's on you,
well,
Silicon Valley Bank,
was one of the,
central banks,
in creating this,
intermediary,
stadium bank,
tier,
thanks to,
fucking Mike Crapo,
and all the,
dipshit,
lying VCs,
in Silicon Valley,
who essentially,
wanted to,
be able to put,
their money in banks,
where that money,
could be used for,
wildly irresponsible,
financial speculation,
because it is gambling,
right,
at the end of the day,
it's fucking gambling,
that is all anyone,
really needs to know,
about abstract economics,
about the way,
the markets work,
it's gambling,
that's it,
so,
these people,
wanted their bank,
to be exempt,
from regulations,
on that kind of shit,
right,
and,
then the whole,
goddamn thing,
falls apart,
and suddenly,
they want,
all those regulations,
back in place,
to pay out their deposits,
on some pretense,
that they were rooked,
taken advantage of,
fooled,
which is,
completely,
completely,
fucking,
absurd,
that is not,
true at all,
the entire purpose,
of this bank,
the reason it existed,
was to allow,
these people,
to do,
really risky shit,
with a lot of money,
and face,
no kind of oversight,
or regulation,
in so doing,
that was its,
raison d'etre,
and so,
any sort of,
founder,
founder,
god,
I hate that word,
founder,
Peter Thiel,
that,
I mean,
at least,
if nothing else,
we know that,
the founders now,
are just as bad,
as the founders,
in 1776,
and have basically,
the same racial,
and social attitudes,
for the most part,
anybody who is crying,
about how their startup,
is not going to be able,
to make payroll,
with only,
the FDIC payback,
of 250 grand,
per account,
is an absolute,
bullshitter,
and some of these people,
know that they're lying,
but some of them,
and I think this is actually,
more frightening,
don't,
know that they're lying,
because,
there is this culture,
in,
in,
any sort of,
you know,
ninth level,
degree removed,
abstracted economy,
to be sure,
but I think,
particularly,
in the Silicon Valley world,
and the,
the financial world,
to which it is,
attached to the hip,
there is this culture,
of believing,
that,
if,
you,
come up,
with,
some idea,
for a useless app,
and,
if you dress like an asshole,
and have the proper affect,
and,
you can see people,
talking about this shit,
that,
you know,
if,
if,
uh,
if Sam Bankman Freed,
had presented himself,
differently,
if he hadn't done this whole,
like,
you know,
spectrum guy,
and new balance shoes,
fucking act,
uh,
he probably wouldn't have gotten,
anywhere near the amount,
amount of investment he got,
and,
on the other end,
Elizabeth Holmes,
still one of the most amazing people,
of the century to me,
this woman,
put on a black turtleneck,
and talked in a pretend voice,
to sound like Steve Jobs,
for five fucking years,
and she made a billion dollars,
and she lost,
well,
I was gonna say,
every goddamn bit of it,
but,
you know,
probably not,
she's probably got money,
stashed elsewhere,
so,
there is this idea,
that,
yeah,
if you can get somebody,
give you a hundred million dollars,
for your app,
you're a business leader,
a thought leader,
you,
you are one of the cavaliers,
of the new capitals class,
well,
the problem with this shit is,
um,
banks,
like SVB,
were,
operating,
in a condition,
of,
zero interest rate,
they could throw money,
at whatever the fuck,
they wanted to,
because they knew,
look,
ultimately,
we lose some here,
we get some back here,
as long as it's all liquid,
as long as nobody ever,
cashes out their chips,
right,
we're gonna be fine,
because,
this money,
as long as we have,
zero percent interest,
we're,
we're just,
we're making it up,
we're printing it,
it's fun money,
who gives a fuck,
and,
uh,
of course,
because they were completely incompetent,
they didn't do,
all the hedges,
against,
uh,
the circumstance,
of an interest rate changing,
that every competent bank,
is supposed to do,
so these people didn't know how to run a fucking bank,
but,
the people,
they were lending money to,
didn't know how to run a fucking company,
that,
the,
the fact that you can get millions of dollars in monopoly money,
from a pretend bank,
does not mean you know how to run anything at all,
I mean,
Sam Bankman Freed,
started off,
just basically,
his,
the,
the roots of his fortune,
were in figuring out,
how to buy Bitcoin at one price,
and then almost instantaneously sell it,
at a slightly higher price,
in another part of the world,
that's it,
that's all the guy ever fucking invented,
and that's not an invention,
that's a scam,
and,
the,
the,
the VCs,
and,
and,
uh,
startups who are saying,
you know,
with only the FDIC insurance,
we,
we're not going to be able to make payroll,
well,
that is an admission,
that you don't know how to run anything,
because if you knew how to run things,
uh,
you would do what is called sweeping the payroll,
which is to divide it up into a series of different accounts,
every one of which,
just meets the FDIC threshold,
so that,
if your bank should go under,
for instance,
it's not your entire payroll for a year,
in one fucking account,
it's all spread out,
so that you make all of it back,
right,
and,
this is part of what I am trying to get to,
in talking about,
abstraction,
and being talking about dragged away,
it's not just,
that,
we,
we have this insane system,
in which anyone who can,
essentially create an artificial,
artificial media environment,
which suggests that he or she,
or that his or her product,
is going to be profitable,
and popular,
even if,
uh,
the product,
as often happens,
does not exist,
or even if it does exist,
and it's already a failure,
uh,
sure,
it's that,
it's that,
these people can get,
fucking monopoly money,
or could,
in the zero interest rate period,
to do,
whatever they wanted,
and,
mostly,
what they wanted to do,
was claim to be,
some kind of inventor,
or genius,
or founder,
get a bunch of money,
for that claim,
and then just speculate,
with all the money,
that supposedly,
was running,
their companies,
that is how this shit,
actually works,
you know,
the IPO valuation,
of whatever fucking tech company,
that money is not,
to run Twitter,
to run Facebook,
to run FTX,
no,
fuck no,
that money is,
primarily,
for,
dubious,
and often illegal,
financial speculation,
done by the company,
which the,
uh,
dubious,
and often illegal bank,
is hoping will pay them,
dividends,
eventually,
so,
we talk about,
you know,
the,
the,
tech wave,
and the economy,
and the horrible,
Silicon Valley-ization,
of so much of the economy,
the economy,
and that is all true,
of course,
but,
the real problem,
is lower than that,
the real problem,
is in,
extraction,
uh,
first from the,
uh,
imperial core,
and then,
being offshored,
to all of our,
imperial holdings,
how,
that kind of,
resource extraction,
and that demand,
for,
essentially,
what you,
hope is a,
sub-human labor force,
how all of that,
leads,
the actual,
economy,
of the imperial core,
supposedly,
the most powerful place,
right,
to be,
enormously,
fragile,
and dependent,
on,
basically,
whether or not,
the same people,
uh,
keep making the same bets,
and whether or not,
the people who give them the money,
for those bets,
keep believing,
that these assholes,
know what they're doing,
that is what it stands upon,
and,
you see this,
as a,
a symptom,
of,
uh,
imperial,
breakdown,
all over history,
all over the goddamn world,
now,
I am not,
you know,
I,
I am hesitant,
to make any sort of,
uh,
fall of the Roman Empire,
comparisons here,
because,
frankly,
um,
people do that,
way too much already,
and I also,
just,
flat out,
do not know enough,
specific stuff,
about the fall of the Roman Empire,
to make that comparison,
but what I can tell you,
is that,
the thing we are seeing now,
this is not an accident,
this is not bad luck,
this is not,
you know,
fateful calamity,
befalling us,
this is the nature,
of who we are,
and what we do,
in this fucking country now,
this is what we're here for,
we built,
an economy,
so imperialized,
after World War II,
and,
and,
by the by,
let me pause for a minute,
to say that,
um,
World War I,
you know,
famously,
the,
the dumbest,
most convoluted,
most difficult to understand war,
in modern history,
well,
I'm certainly not,
uh,
pretending to explain it in one shot,
but a huge amount,
of,
of the,
you know,
colonial,
imperial tensions,
that helped cause that war,
had to do with,
access to foreign markets,
whether,
uh,
they were markets that,
you know,
had natural resources,
and labor,
that you were stealing,
for the imperial core,
or,
whether they were markets,
to sell,
all the bullshit,
all the bullshit,
you built,
in the imperial core,
that was a really big part,
of what started World War I,
and,
and,
let it be emphasized,
as,
as I have said,
I think more than once here,
what an absolute apocalypse,
World War I was,
how,
just,
just,
impossible to escape,
the devastation was,
how far beyond,
the scope of human comprehension,
any of this shit was,
that,
living through World War I,
even if you were in a country,
like,
England,
that wasn't,
you know,
directly attacked,
um,
it,
it was living through,
the end of the world,
as,
as far as,
as far as you knew it,
you know,
like,
like Chris Wade just said,
it,
it's always the end of the world,
you know,
and,
that,
apocalyptic,
destruction,
of,
of the,
imperial entanglements,
that,
uh,
that helped lead to the war,
well,
those things were,
only,
redressed,
in the interim,
between the two wars,
with,
basically,
socialism,
and command economies,
now,
of course,
uh,
different countries,
did things different ways,
to different extents,
but,
you look at the countries,
that,
that,
managed to,
survive that,
without,
going into a full,
uh,
fascist phase,
and it was largely,
acting,
against,
this,
uh,
this centrifugal,
imperial core force,
in which,
you only manipulate,
abstract value,
and everything else,
everything real,
comes from your colonial holdings,
you know,
the,
the goal was to,
to build shit,
to fix shit,
to get working people,
back into the economy,
um,
and,
this is,
you know,
when people ask,
uh,
how,
how is it possible,
for Hitler,
to have,
to have ascended,
you know,
to,
to,
essentially,
the throne,
of Germany,
were there really,
that many,
anti-Semites,
just among,
the,
the,
the German population,
in general,
well,
I mean,
look,
let's not let them off,
too easy,
there's a lot of,
rabid fucking,
anti-Semitism,
in Germany,
but,
you know what else it was?
It was,
the adoption,
in the early days,
of fascism,
of certain,
quasi-socialist,
policies,
that,
helped,
backstop,
free-falling,
economies,
you know,
the,
the,
the Italian fascist manifesto,
of 1919,
has,
a couple,
straight up,
socialist,
planks,
in it,
and one of them,
for example,
is that,
the arms industry,
should be nationalized,
because,
everyone who lived through,
World War I,
got to see,
firsthand,
what happens,
when,
private arms manufacturers,
and private arms dealers,
uh,
sell shit,
to one side,
of,
of a possible conflict,
and then go to the other side,
and say,
well,
you know,
they,
they've all got the new guns,
if you're gonna fight them,
you're gonna need the new guns,
and,
in,
in Nazi Germany,
there was the,
the,
uh,
government backstopping,
of mortgages,
there,
you know,
the,
the economic chaos,
of the,
15-ish years,
between the end of World War I,
and,
uh,
the ascendancy of Hitler,
meant,
that,
people who had something,
like a mortgage,
they didn't know how much their currency was worth,
they didn't know who owned the mortgage,
they didn't know if the mortgage was still valid,
if the mortgage was granted under an interim government,
that had collapsed,
was it legal,
you know,
there were all kinds of questions about this,
and,
the,
the fact that the Nazis decided to,
uh,
guarantee,
mortgages,
meant,
that they,
not only could,
could get some hang,
on the,
the free falling German economy,
but also,
and this is very important,
that the sorts of people,
who owned houses,
who had mortgages,
were suddenly Nazi partisans,
the same way you could see,
so many fucking people,
so many fucking Republicans,
if they were being honest,
during the Trump years,
say,
well yeah,
obviously the guy's a,
crazy,
stupid,
or both,
but like,
it's really good for me,
the way these things are working out,
in the same way,
the,
the,
uh,
one time,
upwardly mobile,
German middle class,
suddenly had an intense,
loyalty to Hitler,
you know,
as,
as Matt Crispin has often said,
um,
the,
the suburbs,
traditionally,
are the social basis,
for fascism,
and that's how this shit works,
that yes,
of course,
a lot of it is,
is pure insane hatred,
and,
fucking,
absolutely bonkers,
ideas about German destiny,
and shit,
but part of it is also,
that,
these governments,
not just Nazi Germany,
but to some extent,
um,
fascist Italy,
to a lesser extent,
certain other places,
that were toying with the idea,
of fascism,
or,
were engaging in,
I guess,
what you might call,
post-fascism,
like the Juan PerÃ³n years,
in,
in Argentina,
they were willing to,
uh,
put a,
you know,
a lower bound,
a lower limit,
into,
their own economies,
past which,
you know,
the good people,
the upwardly mobile people,
the,
the people who were,
in the position to buy houses,
past which those people,
couldn't fall,
right,
and,
they did not do this,
out of any fucking,
humanitarianism,
or decency,
or even really,
ideology,
the idea there,
is essentially,
if we get these people,
on our side,
we can then,
go,
all fucking out,
on the resource extraction,
economy,
right,
we're gonna take over,
fucking Europe,
we're gonna make,
some of our own people,
slaves,
we're gonna steal,
the,
you know,
the combined wealth,
of,
as much of the European,
Jewish community,
as we can,
you know,
it's not like the Nazis,
were actually socialists,
like they actually,
you know,
fixed anything,
it was a,
a loyalty play,
you know,
pitting,
uh,
the,
the burgers,
you know,
the,
the,
the one time,
upwardly mobile,
suburban,
householders,
against what,
they referred to,
of course,
as international finance,
and what that ended up being,
invariably,
was Jews,
that's what they were talking about,
but,
to,
to understand the rise,
of those sorts of governments,
uh,
in a way that,
I,
I hope it's clear,
it's not fucking,
apologetic,
or justifying,
if anything,
they ever did,
that would be insane,
but,
I think you need to understand,
that element,
that,
that sudden,
um,
I,
I don't know if I'm using this,
this phrase in,
the technically correct sense,
but that,
that sudden willingness,
to take certain elements,
from what you would call,
a mixed economy,
to build up,
your power base,
in order to then,
uh,
undertake,
one of the,
most insane,
campaigns,
that a single nation,
in history,
has,
ever undertaken,
it's pretty much,
I mean,
really,
if,
if I'm putting money on it,
two,
the two worst of all time,
Nazi Germany,
and,
and the white colonization,
of the Americas,
and to me,
it's,
it's pretty hard,
for anything else,
to get close,
and white colonization,
of the Americas,
I should say,
includes slavery,
you see what I'm talking about here,
these,
these interbellum governments,
of,
uh,
the early and mid 20th century,
were to some extent,
depending on their politics,
depending on whether you're talking,
FDR,
or Mussolini,
they were,
to some extent,
willing to,
uh,
to try to backstop,
those economies,
by producing things,
of,
actual,
concrete value,
right,
whether it was fixing infrastructure,
or building roads,
or,
uh,
seeing that people,
who had mortgages on houses,
kept those houses,
right,
and,
then,
World War II,
you've probably heard of it,
you know how that happened,
and,
the drift,
ever since then,
and especially from,
the later 70s on,
has been toward,
abstraction,
at the imperial core,
war,
you know,
the,
the industrial base,
of this country,
huge for a while,
and,
then just sort of vanished overnight,
uh,
in part because of,
neoliberal economic policies,
and,
and union busting,
and,
also,
in large part,
because of,
things like NAFTA,
the ability to,
offshore labor,
the ability to,
um,
practice,
is such a gentle word for this,
the ability to,
viciously insist upon,
resource extraction,
uh,
in other places,
so that your own citizenry,
uh,
wouldn't feel,
you know,
wounded by the fact that you were stealing their shit,
the thing is,
in,
in an abstract economy,
in an imperial core,
you were always stealing their shit,
you were always stealing everyone's shit,
because,
the money you make,
stealing from,
you know,
whatever Latin American country you,
you wish to,
uh,
invoke for whatever natural resource,
uh,
say,
lithium from Bolivia,
you're not just fucking over the Bolivians,
you're fucking over all the people who,
in this country,
might have had some kind of decent,
sane,
not soul-crushing job,
uh,
with maybe,
hey,
even something close to a living wage,
maybe even the ability,
to,
to buy a fucking house,
used to be the,
the American guarantee,
and,
now,
I,
I think I know,
of all the people I've known in my life,
well enough to know this,
I think I know like,
two,
who have bought houses,
that shit is just gone,
for my generation,
and I'm guessing for the generation,
after me as well,
um,
there is,
there,
there is no,
such thing as just,
fucking over,
the other side,
whatever the other side means,
because,
the way you're fucking them over,
the resource theft,
the underpaid,
or outright slave labor,
that's not just,
bad shit,
that is happening there,
right,
that is,
potentially,
good shit,
that could have happened here,
and,
of course,
didn't,
because,
everything we live on now,
and not only,
as I said before,
not only in the monetary sense,
of economics,
everything we live on now,
is about,
third,
fourth,
fifth derivative,
levels of abstraction,
creation,
and this is part of why I thought to do this episode,
before even the Silicon Valley Bank stuff,
because,
in the last one,
I talked about,
the miracle of,
of jazz,
the,
the miracle that,
uh,
black music,
in this country,
was able to forge,
out of,
just,
hideously adverse circumstances,
and the most unlikely,
source materials,
and I talked about,
that in terms of,
derivatives,
as well,
not financially,
but,
you know,
derivatives and calculus,
the idea of,
you know,
here's the shape,
and then here's the shape,
of how the shape changes,
and then here's the shape,
of how the rate of change changes,
and on,
and on,
and on,
to an infinite point,
and,
and that is,
the beautiful side,
of this idea,
this American theme,
right,
on the other,
evil,
hideous side,
there is,
an economy,
which is literally,
to,
to the letter,
of the original words,
you know,
oikonomia,
house law,
how you manage,
your own house,
economy doesn't have,
a goddamn thing,
with managing,
your own house,
at this point,
economy has,
uh,
everything to do,
with violently,
managing the houses,
of others,
so that you may,
let your own,
speculate,
off into infinity,
uh,
with no real consequences,
except every once in a while,
there might be,
an actual liquidity crisis,
in which case,
the people who caused it,
get bailed out,
and we all get fucked,
and I think it's,
it's very,
uh,
it's very much worth thinking about,
the Obama reaction,
to the 2008 crisis,
to put this in perspective,
that,
the argument there,
right,
was,
too big to fail,
we let this amount of money,
go out of the economy,
it's going to cause,
you know,
an echelon,
a chain reaction,
of crises,
well,
even if you,
uh,
even if you admit that is true,
even if you take that as read,
uh,
we had,
a very basic choice there,
right,
or rather,
we,
you and I didn't have the choice at all,
the people who run the fucking world,
had the choice,
um,
they could have,
made all the banks whole,
just shoved,
our money back into their fucking gullets,
the way they did,
or,
they could have,
bailed out all the people,
with the mortgages,
all of the people,
who got,
fucked over,
either because,
they were,
uh,
given,
which is to say,
tricked into,
mortgages,
that they didn't really understand,
they didn't know what they were dealing with,
there was no kind of,
you know,
uh,
serious advice from anyone,
on,
you know,
whether or not this is a good idea,
whether or not it even makes sense,
uh,
those people,
and also the people who,
you know,
went about getting mortgages,
the same way people in this country,
have gotten mortgages since,
you know,
the fucking GI Bill,
only it turned out that,
all the debt from their mortgages,
had been repackaged,
into financial derivatives,
that were owned,
by people that they had,
uh,
never even heard of before,
and,
those derivatives,
were then repackaged,
into yet more derivatives,
and,
it turns out,
the value of those,
had cratered,
so actually,
uh,
you don't own your house anymore,
we could have given the money,
to those people,
we could have bailed out,
that end,
and,
of course,
there are a thousand,
social and political reasons,
why we didn't do that,
um,
foremost among which,
is that the people who,
are allowed to make these decisions,
know that the,
the peddlers of the abstract,
you know,
the,
the dickhead posse,
of,
just pure gambling,
they pay the bills,
for the political class,
right,
we get that,
we know that,
but,
I also think,
it is,
it was and is,
a,
a major factor,
I think,
uh,
even if not,
on a conscious level,
a major factor,
in terms of,
the way our,
our bullshit government,
decided to deal with all that,
that,
they saw,
on the one hand,
we could,
bail out,
all these people,
who did,
something real,
who took a mortgage out,
on a home,
and,
then were defrauded,
whether that,
that fraud was from the very beginning,
or whether that fraud,
took place in terms of the,
uh,
financialization,
of their mortgage payments,
or,
we could bail out,
the people who peddle,
in the abstract,
and,
if we bail out,
the people who have the mortgages,
we are going to be,
putting our money behind,
something real,
something concrete,
something that is actually,
a social good,
for someone,
that will mean,
a massive,
uh,
massive transfer of wealth,
not just toward,
poorer people,
but,
toward people,
who are using that money,
in a concrete,
pragmatic,
non-speculative way,
they want a fucking place,
to live,
right,
that's it,
if we do that,
we are going to be taking,
lots of money,
out of the speculation economy,
and into the,
ever dwindling,
concrete,
material,
economy,
and we can't do that,
because,
we understand,
that,
as the imperial core,
our business,
is not to make anything,
to do anything,
to fix anything,
to invent anything,
to improve anything,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
that's for,
the poor countries,
uh,
where we have people,
all over the world,
working in,
essentially,
slavery,
that's for,
I mean,
Elon Musk is building,
a fucking company town,
outside of Austin,
that,
that,
if his plans go through,
is going to have,
its own currency,
you know what that means,
you know what the company store means,
right,
and,
if we were to put that money,
on the other side,
of the bailout,
that would be,
a,
a huge vote,
not just politically,
but economically,
against,
the,
fact that,
here at the imperial core,
uh,
we speculate,
we abstract,
we,
drag things away,
from whatever they actually are,
and,
as soon as we're far enough away,
deep enough into the woods,
we slit their fucking throats.
music,
I think,
this is a programming story,
but,
I think,
I think,
it pays out more than,
meat beyond the bridge,
and,
leave the or seriously,
damn,
leave it place,
we're large enough into the halt,
so there's always,
and even,
if it appears to be the rules,
and,
the one's pr fotos,
and,
which is a live,
and then,
so there's always,
the kids to follow them,
and.
end,
how are you,
and,
and the seventh day,
Well, I grew up in the client state of a petro king
With a complicated take on things like human rights
But baby, that's the sacrifice
For bringing joy to the world
And I learned young how the West was one
With Christ's big heart and a bigger gun
It wasn't enough, so we took the moon
Cause Nazi rock, it's science too
Can bring joy to the world
War on drugs, this righteous cause
To clear our streets of criminals
Now civilized by an opioid
So the Sackler family can enjoy
Spreading joy, spreading joy around the world
For New York City, the world loves you
When retribution's surely due
For the zealous who brought you hell
Boy, the heroes and Langley taught them well
How to infiltrate joy
And do it to the world
Can't we all just get along
Like Amazon and Raytheon
Coming together to make a drone
To bring us lunch and kill the sun
In a city just a two-for-one
Ballistic joy
To the world
Please stop resisting
All the joy
All the joy
In your world
Just a car full of celebrities
Singing about the joy
In your world
A string of bad luck
In this final turn
We gathered around
Watched our cities burn
Who could have possibly predicted this?
Said everyone
So we boldly venture into the black
Guided by a grand soundtrack
We'll liberate some foreign stars
And stick a flag on the face of Mars
Does the beauty of starting again?
With patience, zero, and original sin
The mantra rings across the land
How clever
Look at us
We've done it again
We're bringing joy
To whole new worlds
You must admit
We've certainly got an effort
Bringing joy
To whole new worlds
In time these aliens
Were wound all out the joy
Will we bring a home
New worlds
Let me bring in joy
To your world
You better hope
You don't have cheap bananas or ice
We're bringing joy
To your world
You better hope
You don't have dead dinosaurs
We're bringing joy
To your world
You better hope
You don't have big plans
Or else we'll bring it
