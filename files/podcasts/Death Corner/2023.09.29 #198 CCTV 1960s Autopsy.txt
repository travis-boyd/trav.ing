One boy who I hope gets to come back home very soon is Matt Crisman.
I didn't want to, you know, make any of this about me or, you know, foreground my relationship
with the guy to talk about how I'm especially hurt, all that.
But it would have felt strange not to acknowledge it at all.
And I just wanted to say that Matt Crisman is probably the single biggest reason that I
am here right now recording this and you're going to be listening to it.
And I think that before I heard him and not just within the whole framework of Chapo, but
the sorts of things he talks about, I had no idea that there was any audience at all of
for kind of going at the subject matter of politics, the way he does and the way I wanted to, which
is not to do, you know, the horse race bullshit and also not to do the cheap daily show like,
hmm, are you being a hypocrite, sir, thing, but to talk about basically the political imagination,
particularly in this country and particularly recently, the sort of dream life of the culture
that is expressed usually in completely insane ways through its ostensible politics.
I didn't know anybody wanted to hear that.
I mean, I had been writing about that for years and nobody wanted to read it.
So it was hearing Matt and getting to know him a little bit that really was probably the
foremost influence on my starting this show at all.
And then over the years, Matt has very graciously appeared on a number of my shows when he absolutely
didn't have to.
Sometimes those appearances were right in the middle of, you know, rough shit going on for
him.
He could have canceled them so easily.
I wouldn't have been offended.
It wouldn't have been a big deal.
But he he came through every time he ever said he would.
And I think one of the episodes we did together is probably a couple of years ago now.
I think it was called Q Infinitum is one of the best things that I, with his help, have
ever managed to put out.
So I really hope he recovers quickly and fully and gets to see his new child soon, if he hasn't
already.
And congratulations to him and his wife on the birth of that child.
That's one of not not the birth of the child, obviously, but the medical problems.
One of a number of shitty things that have just sort of barraged the world lately.
And one of them is completely personal and I'm not going to say anything about it.
But another it's it's it's so on the nose.
We have a NATO backed country in Azerbaijan practicing completely unashamed, you know, unobscured
ethnic cleansing of Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh.
And it's barely a story.
You know, we you can watch it in real time.
You can see Western entities like NATO, for example, referring to Armenians who have decided
to leave.
Armenians who have decided to immigrate as if they were given any fucking choice at all.
And you can also see the the firsthand testimony of Azeri fucking head cutters, people bragging
about taking ears as trophies off corpses, that kind of shit.
And I don't know that much about recent Armenian politics.
I'm not trying to make some kind of moral stand about how how exactly all of this came
to be and whose government is better, whose whose politics are more in line with what I
believe.
I mean, I'm sure the Armenian government is full of fucking scumbags because every government
is.
And I'm sure the people who really run Armenia, whoever they are, are just awful hogs because
that's who really runs every country on Earth.
It's not a blanket apologia for Armenia as a state and as a government.
But goddamn, the Armenian people can just not catch a break.
And to see this happening very nearly in real time and and to see or rather not see the complete
lack of serious press coverages from most of the mainstream outlets to see how small a
story this is compared to, you know, some new bullshit ramification of, you know, a Trump
indictment or whatever is it's really, really depressing.
It would be really, really depressing anyway.
But it's particularly depressing when we've also got the parliament of a major NATO country
giving a standing ovation to a 98 year old Nazi, a veteran of the Waffen SS Galicia division.
Just I mean, again, in full view, no, no shame, no secrecy right out there.
And I must reemphasize again, I hate to say this to you, gentle listener, because you probably
know.
But when I say Fourth Reich, when I have said Fourth Reich, that's not an analogy.
That's not figurative language.
I am talking entirely literally.
And I've had a few different people this week sort of approach me after the Nazi and Canadian
parliament and go, oh, like you really you really meant that, that that that wasn't, you
know, a manner of speaking.
Right.
I really do.
And the idea that they didn't know who this guy was before before the fucking, you know,
parliamentary presentation is is completely fucking absurd.
I mean, think Zelensky was there, right?
Volodymyr Zelensky.
Not only a Ukrainian, but a Jewish Ukrainian.
If you set up a 98 year old man before Volodymyr Zelensky and tell him this man fought for Ukrainian
independence from the Soviet Union.
Zelensky knows exactly what that means.
There's not some secret other Ukrainian war of independence.
The guy could have fought.
It means one thing.
It means he fought at the very least alongside the Nazis.
And it would seem from things that have come out about the guy since then that it was not merely expedient for him to fight alongside Nazis.
He was an out and out Nazi and presumably still is.
He was an out and out of the way.
He was an out and out of the way.
He was an out and out of the way.
He was an out and out of the way.
He was an out and out of the way.
This sort of shit.
Don't let anyone tell you that that was somehow a PR goof up.
Fuck that.
It was exactly what it appeared to be.
It was them realizing, yeah, we're going to take a little hit for this afterward.
You know, maybe the guy even ends up getting extradited to Poland, which would be very, very funny.
But the message it sends is far more important than, you know, the bit of a triage we'll have to do later.
We are pointing this at people who know exactly what it is, and we are saying to them exactly what they want to hear.
There is no accident here.
None of this is simply, you know, happenstance and mistake.
Don't believe that shit for an instant.
So in a couple weeks with both of those events in them and some other things, it's been real fucking depressing lately in general.
The world, as it often does, seems like a barren, horrible place where nothing really good can ever happen to anyone.
And anything that appears to be good will eventually turn out to have been a lie.
I'm not saying that's true 100% of the time, but boy, do I think that a lot.
And I have been thinking in that context recently a lot about the 60s, due in part to the great Britpop series that's going on.
It might be over, actually, but happened recently anyway at Ghost Stories for the End of the World.
And the way Matt over there very lucidly and very informatively connects sort of 60s revanchism to the sort of politics that emerged out of the Britpop world.
I'm always thinking of the 60s if I'm thinking of things that appeared perhaps to be good or to offer some sort of hope and ended up being vile jokes.
And I was actually going to have or hope to have a collaborative show for this week that I'm very excited about.
I think it's going to be great.
It's still going to happen, but logistical factors made it impossible to do this week.
So over just the last 24 hours or so, I've had to think, okay, what can I do a show about having not really planned for it?
And I don't know if you qualify what I do as art, but let's just use the term artist broadly.
Usually as an artist, I have found you're scrabbling around for an idea going, what can I do?
What can I do? What can I do?
And the answer is almost always whatever you were thinking about already.
That thing is on your mind.
It has been, you know, mutating and catalyzing in your mind.
And there's a reason you're thinking of it.
There's a whole host of reasons you're thinking of it that your, you know, conscious, rational processes may not be able to articulate or put together.
But some other part of your mind, you know, what I have called the surrational part of the mind is making you think about and pay attention to these things for its own reasons.
There is always a logic there, right?
Even in the most horrifying depths of psychosis, which I unfortunately can tell you about firsthand, there is some kind of logic to how you're thinking.
It's just a logic that is very often bent into a strange shape compared to normal people, whoever they are.
And a logic of obsessive, repetitious connection in which via repetition, the objects of your thought become charged with this enormous, horrifying amount of meaning that they wouldn't have for anyone else.
And so you can, you can drop one proper noun, whatever.
And to you, that means an entire fucking galaxy of things.
And to anyone listening to you, it's just a name.
It's a city.
It's a person.
It's a war, whatever.
So when you're stuck, do whatever you're thinking about already.
It's there for a reason.
And what I had been thinking about already, in part because of recent events, were the 60s.
And I had also been listening to Pink Floyd for the first time in a long time and realized I hadn't done a music episode in a long time.
And Pink Floyd were a band that I, you know, I have liked for a long time in a vague way, but never really paid super close attention to.
I am not that big a fan of Dark Side of the Moon.
I think it's a fine record, good even.
But it's, you know, epochal status is hard for me to understand.
Although you do have to go back and see how fucking ubiquitous that album was.
I read the other day, and this sounds like it couldn't possibly be true.
It sounds like a misprint, but it's not.
Dark Side of the Moon was on the Billboard Top 200 album chart for 724 weeks.
It just sold and sold and sold and sold.
Every one of an entire generation has owned that album, right?
And recently I've started to go back to other Pink Floyd stuff and try to absorb it more thoroughly.
And actually, I've been enjoying it a lot more than I thought I would.
You know, sometimes you do sort of a homework listening just to know, like, okay, what is this?
I'm probably not going to like it that much, but there are going to be a few cool things about it maybe I can do something with.
And then at least I'll know what the rest is.
But Animals is a great fucking album, and The Wall is a great fucking album.
And it was The Wall that gave me the idea to do what I'm about to try to do,
which is to talk about a couple of ideas that have come up over and over on this show.
Pinchon's idea, and not just idea, but technique as a writer, of what I would call telescopic history,
and Walter Benjamin's idea of the historic constellation and the dialectical image.
So briefly, Pinchon, you know, if you've heard any of the Gravity's Rainbow shows, you'll know this.
But in that book in particular, he does something spectacular and supremely eerie.
And it took me a long time to figure out exactly what it was and how he was doing it.
But basically, in reading Gravity's Rainbow, you are seeing the 60s as reflected backward through the 40s.
The book in some ways takes place in the 60s.
That's not when the events happen, but it takes place with a logic and a narrative and, you know,
an authorial voice informed by the 60s.
And there are these, you know, proleptic and analeptic jumps back in between the two areas.
The episode with the Richard Nixon surrogate stuck in his car on the freeway when the atomic bomb goes off.
Of course, the end. I mean, Jesus fucking Christ.
The Schwarzkommando interview in which there's that very strange, haunting passage about, you know, 1966 to 1971,
the years I first tasted blood.
The entire thing is sort of set up to make correspondences appear between the 40s and 60s.
And this is what I call telescopic history.
You're telescoping one era inside of another so their connections become obvious and manifest.
And Pinchon does some version of that in almost everything he's ever written.
I think Gravity's Rainbow is the most successful and the most interesting on that level
because he does it with an eeriness that is almost impossible to explain to someone who hasn't read it.
There are parts of that book that are so much like having an actual dream, a long, complicated dream,
and waking up and briefly feeling like the dream world is the real world
and that you shouldn't be in the place you woke up.
This is wrong.
You need to go back there.
I don't know if this is a well-known side effect of being a junkie and then quitting,
but ever since I started quitting about a year and a half ago now,
I cannot sleep without having incredibly long, vivid, and usually horribly violent dreams.
And for the first time of having episodes of sleep paralysis where I sort of know that I'm awake,
but I can't really do anything or move or think, and I'm still stuck inside the logic of the dream.
And then for half an hour after I finally wake up, I feel like, no, that's the real world.
That on some inexplicable level, that is the actual reality.
And the thing that I think is my life is a veil.
It's some sort of complex, you know, analogical point-for-point correspondence
where if you take my waking life and, you know, send it through a series of topological transforms,
you'll get the place I was in the dream, and the dream was more real than this is.
And Pinshaw manages to achieve that in all kinds of passages in that book.
The incredibly sad passage about Bianca on the SS Anubis,
you know, when it cuts without any narrative explanation to the voices in the movie theater
and then says of Bianca,
But of all her putative fathers, she favored you.
And you don't know, so someone has to tell you.
That's, in effect, very few writers have ever achieved.
And he does the same thing in Crying of Lot 49,
having this, you know, correspondence between the early 60s
and then, you know, Jacobean England.
You're only allowed to see the Kennedy assassination
in allegorical form in a, you know, Jacobean revenge drama.
And then also through the entire history of basically letter carrying and mail services
and how that attaches to the, you know, aristocratic history of the House of Tarnon Taxis.
And that corresponds to the development of intelligence agencies
and ultimately the development of the internet at DARPA.
It may still have been ARPA at the time.
I'm not sure.
Which is something that when the book came out, you know, baffled a lot of critics
because Thomas Pinchon basically knew what the internet was in 1964.
Not a lot of book critics did.
But with that knowledge now, it's very clear to see him using a similar kind of technique.
And then in his later work, he tends to do that not so much within books,
but within the relations between books.
So that, for example, even though they didn't come out in this order
and there's not much actual plot to tie them together,
you can kind of see Vineland against the day and Inherent Vice
all as telescoping into each other.
showing the, you know, this basic pattern or basic system or, you know, ecology
or whatever you want to call it,
repeating across time and mutating every time it repeats
from, you know, the late 19 or late 18 and early 1900s,
you know, the labor militant era in against the day
up through the memory of the 60s.
That's the other far extreme in Vineland
in which a number of the characters actually, if you do the genealogy,
they turn out to be descended from characters and against the day.
It's just that Pinchon hadn't written against the day yet.
So there was no reason to know that.
And then Inherent Vice kind of in the middle
as the node actually in that era, you know, it's 1970, but you get the idea,
through which, you know, becomes the medium through which
the earlier and later events correspond.
You know, it's the interface where they exchange fluids
or however you want to put it.
And this is very much in line with a couple of Walter Benjamin's ideas
that I've talked about before.
There's essentially two ways of saying the same thing
about different subject matter.
The historical constellation and the dialectical image,
namely that there are certain things,
and in the case of history, it's, you know, a historical period or event.
In the case of the dialectical image,
it could refer literally to art,
but it also could be essentially anything under the rubric of image.
There are certain things that we cannot possibly take in
at the moment they happen,
and we only begin to understand them
when something later happens
and we can see the relationship to the earlier thing.
The thing discloses itself only over time
according to the way it connects to something else.
And this is, I kind of doubt Benjamin would have known this at the time,
but this is similar in a way to the argument T.S. Eliot makes
in his essay, Tradition and the Individual Talent,
that there is not simply a chronological succession of great books,
and this happened before and this happened after.
Every new, really great book changes all the ones that came before it
because they now stand in a new relation
at a new distance from something else.
The way the influence produces the new book
also changes our understanding of the things
those influences came from.
You see what I mean?
That, you know, Moby Dick, let's say,
is a wildly different book
before and after you've read Charles Olsen.
Because if you haven't read Olsen,
you sort of haven't really read Moby Dick.
You don't see its extension forward.
You know, everything that Ulysses and Joyce in general drew from,
all of those things have been altered retrospectively
by the way he used them.
And the same is true for, you know,
the artist, the writer in general,
that every previous artist and writer
is transformed by their relationship to the new one.
And, you know, his famous analogy
about taking two chemical elements
that don't react with each other,
adding a third one,
and the third one isn't touched,
doesn't change at all,
but it causes a reaction between the first two.
You know, this is the way that
Pinchon's telescopic history,
historical constellation, dialectical image,
whatever you want to call it,
how they all work,
how the thing in the present moment
whatever it is,
and the thing in the past,
whatever it was,
they are not solid substances.
They are not, in the philosophical sense,
the word essences.
They're not just,
this is what they are.
They're mutable and mutagenic.
They're always changing.
Every day you live
changes every day you have ever lived before it,
especially in the sense of
narrative teleology,
if you like.
You know, I've told the story before
about Joyce talking to his brother
waiting for a train
and pointing to a man
who's also waiting for the train
and saying,
this guy's day up to this point
has been probably completely
non-noteworthy,
probably completely unremarkable
series of normal-ass things
he does every day.
But now let's say this guy
falls in front of the train
or jumps in front of the train.
Now,
every single thing he has done,
not just today,
but for days,
for weeks,
becomes evidence
in leading up to how and why
this guy ended up getting hit by the train.
You know,
that's an example I come back to
over and over again
because I think it makes
a lot of sense,
particularly in the
context of,
this is sort of a sidebar,
but not really,
the context of
a Western public,
I think mostly an American public,
that is increasingly obsessed
with true crime shit
and serial killers
and on and on and on.
You know,
there's been a
a real strong taste public
for that,
a very dedicated contingent
for that subject matter.
Over years and years,
I knew people who were obsessed
with those things
in, you know,
the 90s or whatever,
and I thought they were
fucking weird
because it is fucking weird.
And now that has sort of
broken containment
and just became,
become a very significant
and very mainstream part
of American culture.
And there are a lot of ways
to explain and talk about that.
And most of them
don't say anything very good
about human beings.
But I think one way
to explain it
that is less deleterious
to one's image
of the nobility
of the human heart
and so forth
is this exact thing
that I'm talking about.
is the retroactive
bestowal
of significance
upon things
that didn't seem important
when they happened.
Because, you know,
you're watching a show
about a serial killer
or whatever.
Well, you already know
who the guy is.
You know who fucking
Jeffrey Dahmer was,
you know.
So,
anything you see
or hear
about him now,
whether it's in,
you know,
a reenacted dramatic form
or a documentary form,
whatever,
you now see those things
through the lens
of what you know
Jeffrey Dahmer
eventually did.
You know,
the murders
and the cannibalism
and the mutilations
and shit.
You can't look at anything
in Jeffrey Dahmer's life
without going,
yeah,
but how does that relate
to, you know,
him becoming
a serial killer?
What does Jeffrey Dahmer's
experience
at the second grade
spelling bee
have to do with being
a serial killer?
You know,
that might be the most
obvious example
in major western
pop culture
at the moment.
But,
I have been thinking
about this
partly because of
Pink Floyd
and partly because of
Pinchon.
Specifically about
the 60s.
Because I think
The Wall
is a really,
really misunderstood
record
and one that
kind of follows
the Pinchon
technique
for dealing
with history.
No idea
if Roger Waters
would have read
Gravity's Rainbow.
Seems like he might have.
I don't know.
That book was big.
But the same
essential technical
idea
is there.
Because The Wall
is normally
presumed to be
this,
you know,
fucking arena rock
album about
the alienation
of a rock star.
You know,
that's
how it's talked
about.
Even sometimes
by,
you know,
Pink Floyd,
whatever.
And to me,
growing up,
you know,
the later 90s
and the early 2000s,
I was a punk,
man.
I was a punk.
I didn't have,
like,
Liberty Spikes
and a denim vest
because I thought
that shit was
fucking lame
even then.
But,
you know,
punk was kind
of the,
the main sort
of aesthetic
litmus test
I had for
everything
until I was,
like,
15.
And The Wall
was presented
to me as
and sounded
to me like
the ultimate
example of
sort of
bloated,
boomer,
self-obsessed,
like,
oh,
I'm so sad
that I have
all this money
and get
all this pussy
and,
and God,
play to millions
of fans.
It's so hard
being famous.
you know,
it was an object
of great derision
and what's
interesting to me
about it now
is that I think
that derision
is completely
built into
the project
itself
and is an
integral part
of the project
because The Wall,
I think,
in most of the
interesting ways,
is about
the 60s,
not the actual
time period
of the 60s,
but the
concept of
the 60s,
the place
the 60s
occupies
in our minds
and how
all of that
got
completely
corroded
and fucking
porcine
and disgusting
and bloated
and turned
into something
not just
not good
or not accurate
but something,
in fact,
actively evil,
actively
pernicious
to human
beings
and arena
rock in
itself,
the whole
stadium rock
era,
and stadium
rock is
not really a
musical term,
in theory it
describes bands
who play in
stadiums,
but to me
that's really
like
sometime around
1973 or
4
to sometime
around the
late 80s or
early 90s.
Nirvana
played in
stadiums,
they played
gigantic
fucking
stadiums,
but I don't
think of
them as
an arena
rock band.
Arena rock
is a kind
of music
that,
however it
actually sounds,
it is
fomented
and produced
by people
who play
in fucking
football
stadiums
and whose
goal at
any given
time is
to make
a record,
a song,
whatever,
that will
go over
as the
kind of
entertainment
you consume
at a
football
stadium.
It is
music
converted
almost
totally
into
spectacle,
right,
that has
dog shit
nothing to
do with
actual music
and I
think,
I'm not
any kind
of trad
rock
traditionalist,
but I
think the
worst end
of EDM
now,
and I
mean let's
be honest,
the worst
end of EDM
is 99%
of it
because
the worst
end of
rock is
99%
of it,
that's just
how this
shit goes.
The idea
of a
concert,
a gig,
has been
completely
transformed
from anything
that has to
do with
music,
and not
just,
you know,
not just
into a
non-musical
social event,
because that
of course
has been
happening for
a long
time,
but into
an event
you take
part in
principally
so that
you can
document
your own
participation
and then
wield that
documentation
as,
you know,
a congealed
element of
your identity,
of the
profile,
the iconography
you want to
present to
the world.
That's why
people go to
fucking
Lollapalooza.
So let me
tell you,
I used to
go to
music festivals
a lot
as a
newspaper
music critic.
They're
fucking
horrible.
Music
festivals
suck
dick
and
balls.
They
are
fucking
boring
as hell.
There's
almost
always a
weather
problem.
There's
always a
problem
with
fucking
running
out of
food
or
bathrooms
or
whatever.
Bottled
water
is always
17
fucking
dollars.
They
are
always
running
way
behind.
There's
always
some
shitty
band
who
plays
way
too
fucking
long
so
that
the
headliner
goes
on
at
three
in
the
morning.
And
then
when
you
finally
see
the
headliner
you
are
seeing
them
in
basically
a
musical
venue
that
is
perfectly
designed
to
stop
them
from
sounding
good.
Getting
music
to
sound
good
in
an
open
air
environment
with
a
20,
30,
50,000
watt
sound
system
just
blowing
all this
shit
into
the
crowd
that
has
very
little
to
do
with
what's
actually
happening
on
the
stage.
Almost
no one
sounds
good
like
that.
Arena
shows,
festivals,
whatever,
they sound
fucking
terrible,
which
must mean
the people
forking
out
hundreds
and
thousands
of
dollars
for
them
don't
really
care
about
the
sound
that
much.
And
it
was
this
realization,
historically
speaking,
that led
to Roger
Waters
primarily
writing
the
wall,
the
jump
from
the world
of music
and performance
that he
was used
to,
to this
period
in which
spectacle
was the
only
purpose
and
I
would,
you know,
I can't
give a
concrete
historical
timeline
on this
because,
you know,
I don't
know how
you date
this,
but not
just
spectacle
in itself,
not even
just wanting
to go see
the circus,
right,
but wanting
to have
other people
know you
went to
see the
circus.
That's
really the
purpose now.
Whether that
was really
the purpose
back then,
I don't
know,
probably to
some degree,
I think so,
because I
think humans
are vile
in that
particular way,
just in
general.
I just
think that's
true.
And he,
you know,
as a member
of a band
who was
fucking
playing stadiums
all over
the world,
got to
experience
this firsthand.
And so,
I have
come now
to see
the wall
as using
the
telescopic
pinch-on
technique
or,
you know,
the
constellation
binyamine
technique
to talk
about
the 60s
and how
did the
60s
become
this shit.
This is an
album released
in 1979
that is
haunted,
haunted
by the
ghost at
the time,
soon to
be a
living corpse
of Margaret
Thatcher
and of
the
hard right
swing
of Britain
in the
1970s
and not
just Britain,
much of the
world and
especially
much of the
English-speaking
world over that
same time period.
An album that
looks at,
you know,
the things these
people were
espousing and
talking about
in 1967
and asks,
how the fuck
is it that we
got here?
That there is
this huge
right-wing
revanchist
turn and
it's being
supported by
the same
people who
are talking
about love
and peace
and freedom,
man,
you know,
in 1967.
How is
fucking Eric
Clapton,
some of you
will know
from Twitter,
I have a
special hatred
for Eric
Clapton,
how is Eric
Clapton
on stage
in 1976
delivering
a horrific
racist
tirade
about how
the Arabs
and the
Jamaicans
and the
West Indians
all need
to get
out of
England
and how
England is
for the
English.
What happened
in those
years to do
that to
Eric Clapton?
Now,
personally,
I think
Eric Clapton
has been
a
bigot
piece of
shit
the entire
time.
There's a
very
unintentionally
funny
interview
in which
he,
you know,
years and
years later
says,
oh,
yeah,
I was on,
I was so
fucked up,
I didn't
know what
I was
talking about,
I don't
know anything
about politics,
you know,
I got sober,
I'm not like
that anymore,
and then he
proceeds in the
same interview
to talk about
how much
admiration
he still
has for
Enoch
fucking
Powell.
for those
of you
who aren't
English
or don't
have any
particular
interest in
England,
Enoch
Powell
was
the fucking
archduke
of the
reactionary
swing
of British
politics
beginning
in the
late 60s.
Incredibly
xenophobic.
The one who
said that
if immigration
to Britain
were not
curtailed,
that there
would be
rivers of
blood
running
in the
street.
You know,
1970 is a
bit of a
banner year
for British
politics,
because 1970
was when
a constituency
in London
called the
Isle of
Dogs
elected as
its member
of parliament
a man named
Derek Beacon
from the
British National
Party,
which is to
say,
essentially,
the British
Fascist Party.
The guy was
a Nazi,
and he was
in parliament,
and it
was people
like Enoch
Powell who
led to
that being
able to
happen.
In 1970,
you would
think culturally
chronologically,
like,
we're not
that far
gone from
the 60s,
yet they
just fucking
ended.
How is
this happening?
And I
think the
wall is
a way to
get at
that question
by telescoping
the 40s,
the 60s,
and the
80s
together,
and seeing
a kind
of cyclical
pattern in
what appears
to be a
straight line.
You know,
40s,
60s,
80s,
we will
be told
about them
in terms
of development
and change
and progress,
all those
things that
don't actually
exist.
Whereas the
wall,
it's a
trick he
borrows from
Fittington's
Wake,
actually.
the wall
begins with
someone speaking
the second
half of a
sentence.
It begins
with the
words,
where we
came in,
sounding like
a question,
right?
And the
last words
on the
album are,
I think
it's,
isn't this,
and then it
cuts off.
So if you
play it in
a cycle,
it goes,
isn't this
where we
came in?
There's no
end,
there's no
beginning.
It repeats
over and
over and
over.
And I
think that
is a
formal device
to make a
recognition of
this historical
reality that
we are
working here
in swells
and cycles,
not in
straight lines,
and that
what we
have,
you know,
building in
strength,
in support,
in money,
in propaganda,
throughout the
70s,
and right
up to
that demon
edge of
1980.
It's not
a new
thing.
It's not
an incomprehensible
or totally
unforeseen
thing.
We're seeing
here what
our parents
saw in the
30s and
40s.
It is all
happening again.
We're not
going forward
into any,
you know,
unimaginable
future.
We are
going back
into the
part of
the cycle
where
reactionary
demons
get to
take the
world over
for
various
reasons.
Of course,
there are
economic
things specific
to the
70s and
so forth,
the Volcker
shock and
the dismantling
of the
British welfare
state,
so on,
so on.
But in
major part,
in significant
part,
because of
some very
similar phenomena,
and this
probably isn't
going to stop
here.
This is
probably going
to keep
happening.
So,
the Wall
is not,
it's laid
out in a
linear way
in terms of
telling the
story of
the rock star
losing his
mind,
and basically
the version
of it that
you would see
in the movie,
The Wall.
But within
the album
itself,
it jumps
around from
period to
period to
period,
over and
over and
over,
often even
within the
same song
or the
same extended
piece,
in a way
that I
think is
about
showing you
this cyclical
continuity,
right?
That we
have a
generation
here who
were born
into a
very,
very odd
psychological
clash,
which is to
say their
first memories
are very
likely of
things like
the Blitz,
of being
in an
active
fucking
war zone
with bombs
falling
anywhere at
any time,
with V2
rockets faster
than sound,
you know,
just exploding
down the
street,
and even
for decades
after World
War II,
there were
major parts
of England
and particularly
of London
that were
still just
bombed out
ruins,
that were,
you know,
basements under
houses that
didn't exist
anymore,
or halves
of buildings
that just
hadn't been
torn down
yet,
you know,
that would
have stuck
with you
in a real
day-to-day
way if you
were born
in the UK
in the early
40s,
and of course
for Roger
Waters,
beyond the
general idea
of the war
and of
destruction
and,
you know,
decay and
violence from
nowhere,
he, of
course,
grew up
without a
father because
his dad
died at
the Anzio
Bridgehead
in, I
believe,
1944.
Roger Waters
was five
months old
when that
happened,
so there's
a very
good
probability
that the
first thing
he ever
knew,
the first,
you know,
piece of
data he
possessed
in a sort
of, you
know,
computer-like
cognitive model
way is,
I don't have
a father.
other kids
have a
mom and
dad,
but I
don't have
a dad
because he
died in
the war.
And if
you look
into the
Anzio
Bridgehead
battle,
it was
just,
it's not
just that
it was
unnecessary
or stupid,
it was a
complete
clusterfuck
by Allied
Command
that basically
sent these
British troops
to hold
a bridge
in Italy
assuming that
the resistance
to that
from the
fascists
would be
light if
there was
any resistance
at all.
And instead,
the British
troops showed
up there
and the
fascists
had tanks
everywhere
and basically
annihilated
the Allied
forces.
It was,
it,
it,
it,
this is the
thing I come
back to over
and over again
with Rogers
and the wall.
it would be
so fucking
hard for me
to grow up
hearing about
the heroism
of World War II,
the greatness
of beating back
the Nazis
and fascists.
You know,
the old
Dunkirk spirit,
don't you,
my boy?
Yes,
yes,
England is not
always a nation
that has had
all of its
citizens on the
same page,
if you will,
but,
but when,
when it gets
down to the
nitty-gritty,
you know,
we come together
and there is
no people
on earth
stronger than
us or more
willing to
make sacrifices.
So you were
being told
daily about
the glory
of those
who gave
their lives
to allow
you the kind
of life
you have
now,
right?
40s,
50s,
60s.
And I
would have
to think
you would
be thinking
two things.
Number one,
yeah,
my dad
didn't die
for the
glorious
protection
of anything.
He,
he,
he died
because his
superior
officers
were fucking
morons.
He died
for no
reason at
all.
You can say
what you want
about the
war,
but,
but my
dad didn't
die to
protect
anything.
And number
two,
if you take
seriously the
premise that
this glorious
sacrifice was
necessary to
produce the
world we live
in now and
to protect
our freedoms,
I would
think you
would be
looking around
at society
in general,
culture in
general,
and politics
in particular
all the time
and thinking,
so this is
what he died
for.
So all the
shit you guys
are doing
here,
this is what
he died
to allow?
Enoch Powell
is what he
died for?
Derek Beacon
is what he
died for?
I mean,
even the
slow atrophy
of the
British welfare
state in
general,
really,
he died
so that
could happen.
And this
is obviously
the fascist
rally part
of the wall
at the end
is this
cycling back
to that,
which I
want to get
to in a
moment,
but I
think it's
necessary to
talk about
the 60s
part of this
in particular,
partly because
one thing I
have never
seen noted
about the
wall is
how much
of it is
musical
pastiche.
I don't
know how
you could
miss that,
but how
many songs
or types
of music
it directly
skims from
to make
the historical
point.
So that
Goodbye Blue
Sky is a
song about
World War
II,
about terror
and violence
and bombs
falling from
the sky.
And the
chorus melody
of that
is almost
exactly the
same as
Ruby Tuesday
by the
Rolling Stones.
There's no
way Roger
Waters didn't
recognize that.
So again,
we have a
musical
telescoping
effect here
where a
song from
the height
of swinging
London,
hippie city
on the
face of the
earth,
man,
where Roger
Waters is
pulling that
back into
the 40s
of the
blitz and
saying,
yeah,
I'm really
glad you
got to
have your
cool hip
swinging
life.
Millions of
people died
for it and
we're told
every day
that they
died to
enable you
to live the
beautiful kind
of life you
have now.
So I really
hope you have
fun with these
fucking 60s
because they're
the reason I
don't have a
father.
You know,
everything we
think of in
terms,
you know,
the coolest
place,
you know,
Carnaby Street,
right,
Denmark Street,
right,
I was Lord
Kitchener's
valet,
you know,
the city that
is at the
center of the
cultural world
again in the
60s and
there's a real
neo-colonial
aspect to that
that I'm going
to mention too.
All of that
is built on
the decaying
corpses
of people
who died
in rocket
attacks and
are still
buried under
the rubble
and no one
has ever
dug them
up.
And I
think Nobody
Home,
which is one
of my favorite
songs from the
wall,
incidentally,
is really
obviously a
John Lennon
pastiche.
You know,
the John Lennon
of isolation
and imagine
the,
you know,
post-Beatles
more and more
sort of
self-involved,
self-obsessed,
the only
truth is to
speak of
myself
subjectively
era of
John Lennon
as a
musical
encapsulation
of the
60s
souring
into the
kind of
self-indulgence
and self-obsession
that they did.
I think the
fascist version
of In the
Flesh
near the end
of the album
is very
clearly a
pastiche of
Ziggy Stardust
era David
Bowie.
Because Bowie,
I mean,
I've talked a
million times
about that.
Nobody understands
the inherent
Nazi structure
of mass
culture better
than David
Bowie did.
And this would
have been right
after the time,
you know,
Bowie was getting
in trouble for
the thin white
duke and for
talking about,
you know,
Britain's slide
back into
fascism.
That couldn't
have escaped
Roger Waters'
mind.
He would have
known.
And then the
most obvious
because they're
just straight
up poles,
Vera Lynn and
Bring the Boys
Back Home,
right?
And it's an
incredible stretch
from, I guess
it would be
Hey You up to
about Comfortably
Numb.
That is the
entire album
in miniature.
And in the
transition from
Vera Lynn and
Bring the Boys
Back Home to
Comfortably
Numb, this
astonishing thing
happens where
basically you
have the two
stations here to
either side of
the 60s.
The 60s that
were supposed to
be a revolution.
The 60s that
were supposed to
change everything.
The 60s that
are supposed to
be the bedrock of
modern popular
culture.
Well, before
them, you have
Vera Lynn and
Bring the Boys
Back Home.
Then there's a
blank in the
middle.
And then we
see the prize to
which the
greatness of the
60s has led
us.
Comfortably
Numb.
Which is not
a drug song,
incidentally.
I guess the
beginning of it
came from the
fact that Roger
Waters once had
to play a Pink
Floyd show with
swollen, numb
hands because he
contracted hepatitis,
I think it was,
and didn't know
what it was, so
didn't get any
medicine.
That's what
that line in
Nobody Home
about the
swollen hand
blues is.
So Comfortably
Numb was at
first a literal
thing about
playing a show
where he could
not feel what
was going on,
couldn't feel
what he was
playing.
But the
metaphorical
potential there
is obvious
that we have
gone from this
era in which
pop culture was
supposedly going to
be the driving
force of
change, not
just within the
cultural landscape
itself, but in
politics, in
government, in
international relations,
maybe even in the
entire concept of
economics or
exchange.
What's money?
There's a great
Monty Python sketch
about the
hippie squatters
who are squatting
inside another
person's body, and
as soon as they
cut the guy open
and the squatter
comes out,
you know, turn
on, tune in,
drop out, and
other phrases,
money isn't real.
I think of that
all the time.
Comfortably
Numb is what you
get on the other
end, is this
nightmare of
isolation in
which you are
on stage playing
for 50,000
people to whom
your music and
allegedly music in
general is
supposedly very
important, right?
It's the bedrock
of their identities.
It's the main
engine both via
which they can
imagine changing
the world and
via which they
imagine the world
changing.
It's everything to
them, right?
And you know,
bullshit.
This is the circus
coming to town.
This is people
wanting to have
pictures of
themselves taken at
the circus to get
the stickers, to get
the backstage passes,
to have the ticket
stubs.
And I up here
singing to 50,000
people am more
alone than I have
ever been in my
fucking life because
all of what the
60s were meant to
promise has atrophied
into this.
This is the part we're
still allowed to have,
right?
And the 60s are,
let's put it this
way, if you are a
young-ish person from
really most Western
countries, but
especially if you're a
white kid from an
English-speaking
country, you were
taught very young to
revere the 60s as,
you know, like Danny
the dealer says,
the greatest decade in
human history.
history, you were
taught that this is
the foundation of
your culture.
This is the stuff
that invented the
modern world for
you.
This is the stuff you
have to go back to
and learn to
understand your
roots, right?
And there was
probably a point for
many of you at
which you had a
kind of reflexive,
worshipful reverence
for the 60s as
that exact thing.
And that's not
necessarily bad in
itself to go
through.
I mean, those of
you who have heard
this show a lot
will know I am
absolutely an
unapologetic idealist
about the Beatles
and not just
musically.
I think the
advent and
existence and
output of the
Beatles is one of
the great miracles
in human history.
And then you
probably have a
period in which
you dig a little
bit more into the
60s and you
start looking into
what 60s guys
did afterwards.
You start looking
into the 70s and
80s and where
they went and what
happened to their
politics and you
get fucking
disgusted with the
entire notion of
the 60s and you
see it as the
absolute epitome,
the perfect example,
you know, one
could not ask more,
of superficial
change being
accepted, being
allowed to occur
strictly on the
cultural level,
right?
As long as it
never really
affected the way
things really work.
As long as it
never made any
contact with the
people who actually
run the fucking
world.
As long as,
you know, the,
I mean, the 60s,
even late 60s,
we've still got,
well, more so in
the UK than the
US, but, you
know, remnants of
a social democratic
or even in
England outright
socialist welfare
state.
Well, as long as
the people who own
the world can keep
dismantling that,
yeah, you can wear
velvet pants of
any color you want.
You can have
fucking 600,000
people dicking
around on a farm
in upstate New
York as long as
we keep doing the
Phoenix program.
That's absolutely
fine.
Because that's
600,000 people who
aren't paying its
interest into the
Phoenix program.
As long as the
CIA can continue
its global campaign
of fucking terror,
fraud, drug
trafficking, sex
trafficking, murder,
horror.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Dude, if you want to
wear a satin shirt,
that is sick.
Like Roger Waters
says, acknowledging
this in Nobody
Home, the John
Lennon pastiche,
that I've got the
obligatory Hendrix
perm, I've got the
inevitable pinhole
burns all down the
front of my favorite
satin shirt.
You know, that's the
guy who knows what's
going on.
That is a self-aware
actor, right?
And so the 60s occupy,
I think, for a lot of
people you might describe
as more or less on the
left, a place of
disgust.
disgust.
And that disgust is not
unearned, right?
There is a lot to be
fucking disgusted about
in the 60s.
It, you know, for me
stands as, I've had this
idea since I was a
teenager that I have
thought of as the
reservation, which is
basically the place in
culture they send you to
go do whatever you want to
do because they know it
has absolutely no impact
on the actual running of
the world.
The reservation, a music
festival is a perfect
example.
A place where if you got
the money to get in,
there are basically no
laws, you know, inside
fucking Coachella for
three, four days,
whatever.
And you can pretend that
you are part of some kind
of mass movement and
that, you know, the
spiritual harmony produced
by the collective
vibrations of this
audience uplifting
itself through the
transcendental magic of
music is going to stop
the war in Libya.
You know, yeah, sure.
By all means, believe
that.
I'm sure I've said it
before on the show, but
I think bitterly all the
time when I see anyone
talking about the
fucking anti-war protest
movement of the 60s,
that is, that, yeah,
oh, yeah, protesting
Vietnam, we were so
brave, we were so
effective, we spoke
with such a powerful
voice that we managed
to make the Vietnam
War only last 12 years
and kill three or four
million people.
Fuck off.
I'm sorry.
If you think you
stopped Vietnam, fuck
you.
Vietnam stopped because
it was in our interest
to stop, right?
That's the only reason
the people who run the
world do anything
because it's in their
interest.
And it is likewise in
their interest to let
you think you have some
kind of impact because
without those reservations,
right, without those
areas where you can go to
live out your fucking
delusions about how you're
going to change society,
you might start getting
actually rebellious.
You might start learning
something about how the
world works and wanting to
change it.
you might start taking
more drastic action.
So absolutely, absolutely,
we will tell you one
million times every year
on TV in a new shitty
documentary about the
Vietnam War that you
saved Vietnam.
We'll get fucking wavy
gravy, you know,
smoking a fucking palm
all during an interview
going, you know, I
think, man, I think,
you know, the pigs had
just never seen anything
like that, man.
They weren't prepared
for us in the, you
know, the beauty of the
energy we had.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You can have that as much
as you want.
And in that sense, yeah,
a lot of things about the
60s were repulsive.
But I also have to think
I have to take the other
side at least a little
largely because of the
Beatles and
plead for you to imagine
actually having been there.
because it's all, we know
so much more about the
actual machinery of this
shit now, right?
We understand the concept
of the spectacle and the
culture industry in a way
we didn't then.
But the early 1960s,
that really was a time
when especially if you had
grown up in Eisenhower's
America or in, you know,
50s Britain, as John Lennon
put it, a place where
everyone goes around calling
each other by the last
names as if they're in the
fucking army.
And suddenly you have this
new kind of music and when
you play it loud, people go
crazy.
Like they do things they
wouldn't normally do.
And if you play it loud
enough for long enough and
people listen to it for long
enough, they start thinking
differently.
They do things they wouldn't
have done before and they're
receptive to ideas they
wouldn't have been receptive
to before.
On and on and on and on.
Now, of course, from this
vantage, we can go, yeah,
LSD, MKUltra, Chaos,
COINTELPRO.
You know, there were all
sorts of reasons for this
happening that were nothing
to do with the beauty of the
human spirit.
But if you were there on the
ground at the time, it could
really have seemed miraculous
how there was this feedback
loop between culture as
presented to you and culture
as a reaction to that
presentation.
That it really would have
seemed for a while like
people were learning to think
and act and imagine the world
differently and that the
principal vessels of that
sort of, you know, Gnostic
enlightenment were things like
music.
And of course, you would say
drugs.
And I don't think I need to
make any great comment about
my attitude about drugs in the
1960s.
But people didn't know as much
of that shit, right?
People in the 60s, I mean,
you know, ostensibly well
informed people, they didn't
know what the CIA did.
They thought it seriously was
just an agency collecting
information to be, you know,
acted upon at the discretion
of the president.
There was incredible
naivete about the
workings of what we would
now call the deep state and
about how, you know, the
end of the big war, you know,
World War II, the end of the
war in the newspaper is
really a tithe that the
transnational deep state pays
so it can start the secret
war.
So it can regroup,
recondense,
take stock of its assets,
move them around into more
advantageous positions,
and come up with plans
larger and more horrifying
and at more
inconceivable scale than they had
ever tried so far.
And this is something you see
very obviously from, you
know, the late 40s up
through the 80s in
particular.
Yeah, we don't have to
elaborate that much
because I think if you're
here listening to me at all,
you got a pretty good idea
of how it worked.
But I do think it's
important to understand
how the 60s could have
seemed on the ground.
Not just as a matter of,
you know, sympathy, but
also as a matter
of the extent
of betrayal
that anyone with a
fucking conscience
would have felt
afterwards.
And I think there's a
reason, you know,
you get this record,
The Wall,
from Roger Waters
as opposed to a whole
lot of other people,
right?
Because I think Roger
Waters, as he has
proven in taking a
whole lot of shit
for absolutely
preposterous reasons
in recent years,
is someone who
actually believes in
something.
And someone who
at some point
hoped, at least,
that the sort of
superficial, you know,
culture industry change
of the 60s
was going to lead
to something
other than that.
You know, that that
was the first
embryonic stage
of what would later
become something
like wholesale
social transformation.
transformation.
And The Wall is
all about how
that didn't happen.
And not only how
that didn't happen,
but how its failure
to happen
is putting us
back in the same
cycle that led
to the 40s
in the first place,
right?
That led to the
Nazis and the
fascists.
Because what do we
have at the end
of the 60s,
beginning of the
70s?
Basically,
everyone who
will agree to
be bought off
is bought off.
And they become
fucking rock stars,
celebrities,
whatever.
The few people
who really,
really have
convictions and
are really,
really willing
to fight for
them,
they get murdered.
They are
assassinated almost
entirely by the
state as part of
clandestine programs
that we now know
100% were real
and did happen.
And the vast
majority of
people in the
middle,
you know,
this is where
those people
become boomers.
They have the
choice to either
look at the
utter failure
of real change
and if not to,
you know,
become fucking
revolutionaries
because there
aren't many
traditions worse
than white
college students
trying to become
revolutionaries in
the United States.
That shit does
not work.
But if not go
into like,
you know,
active political
violence,
at least to
understand the
relationship between
the things they
have just seen,
to understand that
fucking maundering
on about the
same bullshit
you've been saying
since 1965 is
not going to
change the world.
And in fact,
that's,
it's great for the
people who own the
world because it
makes absolutely
certain that the
whole concept of
change is,
is siloed off
into introspection,
spiritual transcendence,
renewal of self,
self-actualization,
right?
That's the only
real change possible
and no fucking
coincidence that the
people who believe in
things like that are
the people who
essentially founded
Silicon Valley,
are the people who
went into doing
electronics and
computer contracting
for the fucking
Pentagon and CIA
and now run
mindfulness workshops
for, you know,
the ten richest
fucking freaks on
earth where they
all hold hot
stones in their
assholes and,
you know,
chant a mantra
given to them by
a lamasserie they
found on top of a
mountain in Tibet.
There's a reason it
went like that.
It's all a pretty
straight line.
That if the concept
of change could be
entirely delimited
to the culture
industry,
then fine,
good.
Let these guys do
whatever they want.
Let them get real
fucking high and
die in stupid ass
ways.
Drug beefs,
car crashes,
over to,
yeah,
sure,
kill them.
In fact,
you know what we
should be doing?
We should be bringing
in a lot more
drugs.
There's a lot of
heroin in Southeast
Asia and if we can
get some of these
actual political
problem people,
if we can turn
them into junkies,
that's going to do
our job for us and
it's going to make us
a whole lot of
goddamn money in
terms of off the
books operation.
So yeah,
get high,
baby.
Get high.
You know who the
dealer is.
Eventually,
at the end of the
day,
to one degree or
another,
all the drugs sold
on earth are sold
by a government.
That's how it
fucking works.
And the moment,
you know,
the people of the
60s became fucking
boomers is the
moment in which they
failed to recognize
recognize or deal
with any of that
and kept pushing
the same line
first that,
you know,
introspection is
going to,
you know,
change the
fucking,
the makeup of the
Senate to,
well,
it didn't,
but that's only
because everyone
else gave up and
became,
you know,
commercial and
materialist and
crass and these
are the same people
who,
you know,
Jerry Rubin
becoming a
fucking stock
broker.
All these
assholes going
into building
computer systems
for DARPA.
You know,
they are the
same people who
believe that if,
if their
generational
contemporaries had
been just a
little bit more
sincere about
spiritual transformation,
we wouldn't need
war anymore,
man,
while they're
providing the
tools with which
literally every
war is now
fought.
That was a
recognition that
people could have
made.
And,
uh,
people like the
Weather Underground
are no less
guilty of this
either because
their recognition
was not,
holy shit,
we really don't
understand how
things work.
It's,
um,
holy shit,
uh,
10 graduate
students should,
uh,
try to build
bombs.
That's what's
going to change
things.
Propaganda of
the deed,
man.
Revolutionary
terror.
No,
they're assholes
too.
They're just
assholes in a
different way.
And so,
the spectacular
part,
the cultural
part,
is,
is all,
I mean,
as commodified
as literally
anything on
earth ever
has been.
Commodified to
a degree that
wasn't even
technologically
possible until
not very long
before the 60s.
and that's
something I want
to talk about,
uh,
soon,
too,
because I
think there
is,
there's a
reason it
was the
60s and
not another
time.
A reason
other political
movements
happened when
they happened
that I think
has a lot
to do with
the media
of,
uh,
technological
circulation
of,
you know,
image,
sound,
whatever.
And so we
go into
this period
where the
people who
did well
out of the
60s become
more and more
self-involved,
uh,
more and more
disgusted with
their own fans
and audiences
and disgusted
often for good
reasons,
but,
uh,
the results
of that
disgust,
and I think
this is another
thing that is
chronicled on
the wall,
they're not
any more,
you know,
articulate or
perceptive than
the people who
just want to
see the
fucking circus
come to town.
You know,
they,
they start to
think of
themselves as
these grand
misunderstood
tragic
artists,
uh,
rather than
thinking,
yeah,
maybe the
problem is
playing in
a fucking
stadium.
Maybe the
problem is
playing a
show that
is designed
for a
hundred
thousand
assholes
to come
see.
And the
people who
did well
out of it
more and
more alienated
from,
you know,
what were
once their
peers and
are now
their
consumers,
and now
they've got
money,
and now
that alienation
has driven
them away
from whatever
was real
in,
you know,
in populism
in the most
basic sense.
Whatever was
real in the
sense that
normal people
can get
together and
change the
way the
world works,
well,
that's all
gone now.
And meanwhile,
along with
that,
uh,
the welfare
state,
UK,
US,
all over the
place,
has been
dismantled
through all
this,
because it
turns out
you didn't
have any
power to
stop that
from happening.
And so you
get this
fucking
conflagration
where,
uh,
the state,
as people
knew and
relied upon
it,
is ceasing
to exist,
you know,
by the,
by the
middle 70s.
Uh,
there is a
whole generation
of fucking
burnouts and
casualties.
And then
there is this
elect group
of people who
essentially
cashed out
really well
on the
pretend
revolution.
I think
Mick Jagger
is just a
cunt.
And,
uh,
he once
famously said
about the
song Street
Fighting Man,
he was asked
about his
politics and
said something
like,
well,
you know,
I don't
really have
any.
And someone
said,
what about
Street
Fighting Man?
He said,
well,
as long as
people are
going to be
marching,
they're going
to need
songs to
march to,
yeah?
Just
asshole.
And those
people are
now all
going into
Swiss tax
exile,
right?
So what,
what is
this the
perfect
recipe for?
A failed
utopian
populism
leaving,
you know,
a giant
fucking
population
of the
walking
wounded,
plus the
rich
losing
whatever
sense of
that utopian
populism
they ever
had,
plus the
dismantling of
the state
at the
very basic
level,
plus,
particularly
in the
case of
England,
the
decline
of
empire,
the
full,
you know,
legal
dismantling
of empire,
and the
deep sense
of embarrassment
that England
and London
in particular
are no longer
the focus
of world
culture,
are no longer
the city
where it all
happens,
the place
everyone wants
to be.
No,
now we're
just a
fucking
shitty
backwater
ex-empire
on a
rainy,
pissy
little
island
where
everyone
looks like
soggy
paper.
That's
what we
are to
the rest
of the
world.
So what
do all
those
factors
come
together
and
foment?
You
know what
it is.
You
know what
the 1980s
were.
You
have seen
the two
hammers
walking
side by
side,
and you
have heard
the fascist
rock star
yelling from
the stage
about which
members of
the audience
ought to be
executed.
You've seen
it in your
own life.
You don't
need me to
tell you
about it
in a
historical
sense.
The only
thing you
need from
me,
if you
need anything
at all,
is to
give you
the grounding
to show
you that
the same
way Roger
Waters is
telescoping
the 40s
and 80s
through the
medium of
the 60s,
all this
has happened
before and
all this
will happen
again.
You only
need to
understand it
on that
telescopic
level so
you can see
these concentric
circles getting
larger and
larger,
disturbing more
and more of
the world as
they grow
outward until
finally there
will be a
point when
they can
grow outward
no longer
and they
unavoidably
finally,
finally,
at long
last,
just crack
the bounds
of sustainable
reality
and that's
it.
That's the
end of the
show.
And as
for the
remnants of
the dream,
other than
that,
well...
the
world was
too high
as you
can't see
the
wall was
too high
as you
can't see
no matter
how he
tried
he could
not
break free
and the
ones
laid
into
his
brain

Well, I grew up in the client state of a petro king
With a complicated take on things like human rights
But baby, that's the sacrifice
Bringing joy to the world
And I learned young how the West was won
With Christ's big heart and a bigger gun
But it wasn't enough, so we took the moon
Cause Nazi rock, it's science too
And bring joy to the world
The war on drugs, this righteous cause
To clear our streets of criminals
Now civilized by an opioid
So the Sackler family can enjoy
Spreading joy around the world
For New York City, the world loves you
When retribution's surely due
For the zealots who brought you hell
And the hell boy the heroes and Langley taught them well
How to infiltrate joy
And do it
To the world
Can't we all just get along
Like Amazon
And Raytheon
Coming together to make a drone
To bring us lunch
And kill the sons
In a city
Just a tune for one
Holistic joy
Holistic joy
Holistic joy
To the world
Please stop resisting
All the joy
In your world
Just a car full of celebrities
Singing about the joy
In your birth
A string of bad luck in this final turn
We gathered around and watched our cities burn
Who could have possibly predicted this?
Said everyone
So we boldly venture into the black
Guided by a grand soundtrack
We'll liberate some foreign stars
And stick a flag on the face of Mars
The beauty of starting again
Your patience, zero and original sin
The mantra rings across the land
How clever
Look at us, we've done it again
We're bringing joy
To whole new worlds
You must admit we've certainly got a knife for bringing joy
To whole new worlds
In time these aliens will land all out the joy
We'll bring our whole new worlds
We're bringing joy
We're bringing joy
To your world
You better hope
You don't have cheap bananas or ice
We're bringing joy
To your world
You better hope
You better hope
You don't have big plans
Or else we'll bring joy
You better거� ausge
I'll bring it
You better hope
Thank you.
