Sometimes I can see things that happened a long time ago.
I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel over the years.
And not all of them was good.
What about room 237?
1, 2, 3, 7.
First girl, room 237 and chill.
1, 2, 3, 7.
My brother, if anyone's listening to this at all or ever listens to this, they'll probably know.
My brother Michael Judge, the far more talented and more intelligent brother who hosts the show and is the creator of Death is Just Around the Corner.
Which is, again, the far superior show that you should be listening to instead of this.
But if you happen to find this and you like movies and you want to see what I'm doing here and why and click play on it, I hope you enjoy and I want you to know what I'm doing and why.
Basically, I am a platinum selling music producer.
I've been out in Los Angeles for the last six years.
I come from the Midwest.
But I've been here for six years and I've produced for a lot of big artists and got my songs on the radio and on TV and in movies.
And I think I have one platinum plaque and two gold plaques now.
I might have two platinum and one gold.
I haven't checked.
And no, they do not give you those plaques.
You have to buy those plaques.
And that is part of the reason, as you'll see, why I'm sitting here doing this podcast.
But more or less, I've been a music producer my whole life and I also loved movies as a kid.
I got really into movies first and then music kind of took over.
And for the last over a decade, I've been kind of singularly pursuing this goal to the point of signing a publishing deal with a large publisher and getting large Hollywood management and doing big things in my industry.
And that basically all kind of came to a halt during the pandemic, both slowing down across the globe and everyone freaking out.
And then also me signing two bad deals with people who are not invested in or interested in my success.
And, you know, it turns out you cannot be an all star if the coach does not play you.
The combination of those and a bunch of other shit, you know, burnout in general with what it is to be a musician in the social media world of 2022 or at the time 2020 really made me feel like I was living an undignified life doing something I didn't no longer enjoy.
But they don't pay you to be good at music.
They pay you to sell a brand.
And especially now in the social media world, you know, we are encouraged to view and experience everything through the lens of the self.
Everything is a political identity brand decision.
Every song you post, everything you listen to, it's all become little badges to put on your profile to establish an identity brand.
And that's what gets you paid now.
That's what they pay for now.
It's establish a brand first that more or less establishes some identity or virtue that then manipulates people into thinking that following them is a reflection upon themselves.
You have to make yourself into a badge that they can put on their jacket.
They don't pay you to be good at music.
They pay you to build a successful brand that can move units and sell tickets and sell advertising.
And I spent my life getting good at music.
I don't know how to do that other shit.
But anyway, the pandemic and this downtime and suddenly feeling like, fuck this, I don't want to wake up and do music today.
It really led me back to movies.
Like I said, I was a huge movie fan as a kid.
But then I got, you know, so into music and so singularly focused on this goal.
You know, I remember measuring my life at one point of by how many movies I was watching, that if I was watching a lot of movies or TV or whatever, I was not succeeding, that I needed to be working on this goal.
And that was the kind of selfish me time.
And what I found in the pandemic is like, no, that's the only time I'm happy.
That this life, you know, that we all live now viewed through the lens of the self through social media and the way we interact with each other.
You know, it's hyperbolized by trying to make money off that being a musician in Los Angeles in 2022.
I was so constantly thinking about myself and how I'm coming off.
And am I winning or am I losing?
Am I advancing or retreating?
Am I gaining cool points or am I losing cool points?
Who can I work with to elevate my name?
Who can I take a picture with to get more clicks and likes, etc., etc.?
That shit's miserable and an undignified way of life.
And more than that, I think kind of a perversion of the human nature that we're not supposed to.
It's taking all of God's creation in this universe and making it a reflection of yourself.
And you just either judge it good or bad.
Or is it part of my identity brand or not?
And I think that's the wrong way to live life and the wrong way to view the universe.
I think we're supposed to appreciate other people.
I think we're supposed to listen more than we talk.
And what I found with movies is like that's when I was happy, when I was outside myself.
I wanted to do this podcast as a representation of a time when you're not just fucking thinking about yourself.
You're thinking about someone else's words, someone else's images, someone else's acting, someone else's script or cinematography or filmmaking or whatever.
To me, that helped me reconnect to life and make me remember why it's important or good to be alive.
Because fucking bipolar schism between constantly viewing everything through the lens of yourself and then also feeling yourself eroding as anything that makes you you gets kind of burned off as you're trying to compete in this world.
As a terrible, shitty way to live that leaves you constantly feeling aggrieved and like you're not good enough and you never got the chances you should.
I don't know.
Anyway, I'm only happy when I'm not thinking about myself and I'm thinking about, you know, 18th century politics or playing with cats or video games or movies or books or whatever.
Um, and that's why I wanted to do this podcast.
I think there's just an endless amount of shit made by people who are smart enough and talented enough to manipulate you into giving them your money.
And those people all basically establish an identity brand and then feed you shit content.
So I don't want to do music anymore.
I felt like, you know, I thought recently I was riding in an Uber and having to listen to top 40 radio.
I had this thought that every song I'm hearing sounds like it's from a young adult musical and every song sounds like there's a corresponding outfit that you're supposed to be wearing while you're listening to it.
And I just thought like, yeah, that's not, that's, that's undignified bullshit.
That's identity brand first, slop content second.
Um, I mean, look no further than Harry Styles doing a warmed over, basically being doing David Bowie without the good music.
It's, it's, it's bullshit.
It's manipulative fucking bullshit.
And it's taking probably the best and maybe only good human contribution to this universe art and turning it into just more identity brand self lens bullshit that, uh, doesn't help you.
It doesn't expand your boundaries.
Doesn't make you a more thoughtful or more caring or loving person or a more understanding person or a more determined and clear headed person.
You know, the, the things that art can, are supposed to do for you.
It's supposed to help you connect with God, connect with the universe.
That's what art's supposed to do.
It's our, that's our godly thing.
That's our divine thing.
As, otherwise, we're just kind of more animals competing in the food chain.
Um, so anyway, I think a lot of that shit is a, a terrible perversion of it.
And I don't want to do that.
What I want to do is make a podcast for people who love movies.
So there's an episode for a movie that you love that you can listen to before or after, and it'll make your day a little bit better.
It'll make you stop thinking about how you're coming off and how good or bad are you doing.
And think about something else and someone else and, uh, for an hour or two.
And, you know, give you something to look forward to before or after you watch a movie that day or that night.
Uh, that's what I want to do is offer you something.
I'm no expert.
I'm not even very smart.
You can probably tell by how I'm talking.
I'm not very smart.
I don't have a great vocabulary.
I'm not a film expert.
I didn't go to film school.
I just love movies.
And, and that's why I wanted to do this show.
I'm not a expert.
I'm not trained in dialectics.
And I'm not trying to enter my voice into the arena of, of critics.
I'm not a critic.
I, I just want to appreciate these movies and enjoy them and talk about what makes them good and what they're about.
We don't do that with movies a lot.
And, uh, we, we kind of see them once.
You might see them again a couple times throughout your life.
But if you're a freak like me who watches a movie 20, 30, 50 times throughout your life, you know, twice a year and get something new from it every time.
Um, I wanted to make something that you can appreciate and you can put on and, and look forward to, you know, enjoying with the movie before or after it that day.
And with that being said, that's way too long of an intro.
I just wanted to let you know, you know, why I'm doing this and what I think I can offer, why it's hopefully going to be worth your time.
And anyway, with all that said, uh, I'm going to start with the last seven films, obviously not in order, but the last seven films of my favorite filmmaker, Stanley Kubrick, and my favorite movie by him, The Shining.
Okay, so I promise to never do that again.
Let's talk about movies.
Because so far this podcast is kind of a nightmare.
And I'm sure, you know, hearing another guy say, we're going to do a podcast about The Shining, uh, probably sounds terrible.
This is not going to be a Mysteries of Stanley Kubrick unlocked podcast.
It's not going to be that.
And what I want to do instead is look at the story he was trying to tell, uh, especially over, you know, throughout his whole career, but especially over those seven movies.
There's this whole era of mystique and, and, uh, you know, Kubrick's so coy and ironic and what is he really saying?
And I think after, you know, if you watch him enough and if you read enough about him and understand the context, uh, there really is a, a gravity's rainbow of a narrative arc that, um, appears throughout.
And that's what I kind of want to start with and talk about.
We could subtitle this series, uh, Mr. Kubrick or how I learned to stop worrying and love the Reich.
But let's start with a quote from Kubrick himself, uh, from apparently around the time when he was making Paths of Glory.
Kubrick said,
Man isn't a noble savage.
He's an ignoble savage.
He is irrational, brutal, weak, silly, unable to be objective about anything where his own interests are involved.
That about sums it up.
I'm interested in the brutal and violent nature of man because it's a true picture of him.
And any attempt to create social institutions on a false view of the nature of man is probably doomed to failure.
This is what I want to look at in the context that you can view, especially these last seven movies of Kubrick.
You know, everyone, when you became a cinema fan, you say, oh, Kubrick, the shots, one point perspective, my God.
And then the thematic, oh, the performances, everything, you know, it becomes this thing about the fandom and the memes and the quotes and my little droogies and etc.
And I think a lot of people miss what he was trying to do, or at least it's not remembered or talked about in the main conversation.
To me, the shining is really the apex of this idea Kubrick was trying to communicate, especially through his last seven films.
We'll get to Strangelove. I may do that next.
But of course, infamously, Kubrick, while researching Strangelove, learns enough and saw enough about America that he left and never came back.
And he made all his movies in England and on sets overseas and did not come back to America.
Part of it was his fear of flying. Part of it was, I think, what The Shining is about.
So before we start talking about this movie and Kubrick in general, first, if you are interested, most of what I'm going to say is like half-remembered paraphrases from the excellent book, The Stanley Kubrick Archives, edited by Alison Castle.
If you want the facts and the dates and the quotes exactly right, please go read that book.
It's just compilations of interviews and quotes from him and stories from people that really help paint a lot of this full picture and give you a lot of this context.
And I'm going to pull a lot from that book in these seven episodes.
So please go read that.
But something that is really useful in understanding Kubrick and his work is this conversation in that book between him and Joseph Heller, the author, of course, of Catch-22.
In that conversation, Kubrick describes how the relationship between the plot and the world in a movie is similar to the relationship between melody and chords in music.
In that, you know, in a song, the lead melody is the part that you remember.
It's the part your ear gravitates towards.
It's the part you remember and that they play on the radio and that you can sing along to.
And similarly, the plot that a movie tells with its script is the thing that you gravitate to.
It's Dirty Harry or it's Die Hard.
And the plot is a guy stuck in a building and he's got to shoot his way out.
That's the story that you cling on to.
But movies also can tell a story through the world around that plot and the setting and the production.
Just the way good music tells a story with the chords as well around the melody.
You know, bad music is cliche chords that have been done a million times before that stick to genre conventions.
And then you slap your own fresh new melody on top of it and call it a day.
Whereas good music is doing just as interesting stuff with the chords as with the lead melody.
You know, your Paul McCartneys, your Johnny Greenwoods, your Miles Davises, your Princes, etc.
They're not just slapping good melodies on top of cliche chords.
They're doing something new and revolutionary with the chords around the melody too.
And similarly, Kubrick, you know, didn't want to make movies that were all just melody, that were all just plot.
You know, in this dynamic or this idea, you know, something that's all melody would be like, you know, Days of Our Lives, soap operas.
Where it's the only remarkable thing is that Jeff slept with Betty, but she was Pamela's sister and she was Michelle's aunt who killed her baby.
You know, it's all plot.
It's all, it only has internal relevance.
There's no external relevance.
It says nothing about the world or about who these people are, the context, the historical context, the political context, etc.
To Kubrick, you know, he thought he had to tell not only a great melody, but great chords as well.
The chords had to be as interesting as the melody, if not more interesting.
And to me, that's where you can look at him as objectively just one of the best filmmakers in that his movies are working on that level.
And it's kind of a level that only movies can work on because they're the one medium where, as he shows, you can tell one story with the words and the dialogue and the plot action.
And you can show another story with what happens in the background and the editing and the music and the implications and the world, you know, the historical, political, etc. context around what's happening.
And to me, The Shining is the apex of that for him.
Of these, you know, you get these movie magic moments where plot and world, melody and chords all rise up to hit that, you know, here's Johnny.
You know, this moment where the whole world behind this story about misogyny and spousal abuse and pedophilia and rape and domestic violence and colonialism and genocide all comes into this one moment that is actually, you know, in the text of the movie of him cutting through a door to try to kill his wife and saying, here's Johnny.
To me, that's where you can objectively say Kubrick is one of the best filmmakers.
And I think specifically The Shining and Barry Lyndon, you could argue, are maybe objectively the best films of all time in terms of fully using what a movie can be, fully using the medium.
Every, what I view both of those movies is like, imagine like a giant, ornate, you know, like castle size renaissance tapestry that paints this incredible, beautiful picture.
And then you zoom in on each thread and each thread is perfectly tied together, telling its own story that leads up to the whole.
You know, it's, it's the chords and the melody are perfectly in sync and tell their own stories.
And that's, I think that's why his movies are dense and coy and mysterious to people and why there's this whole cult of what is room 237 and CRM 114?
What does that mean?
We'll get there.
We'll talk about all that.
But, but I do think, you know, the fandom of Kubrick gets lost in the woods in the details of his personal life sometimes in these mysteries.
And, you know, these movies seem mysterious and dense.
And he is coy and he is ironic and he did leave clues and hints and he loved doing that.
But he's telling a bigger story too.
And if we could boil that bigger story that he tells, especially over these last seven movies down to a single idea, I think it would be this.
I think Kubrick's work chiefly states that violence is man's ultimate characteristic and his lasting achievement and accomplishment in this universe.
Violence is the mark that man will leave on this universe.
And that all systems of thought and all governments and all the ways that we think that we are liberal and educated and edified are all underscored and undergirded by violence and always have been and always will be.
As, you know, as he said himself, any attempt to create social institutions on a false view of the nature of man is probably doomed to failure.
I'm interested in the violent nature of man because it's a true picture of him.
I think you need to look, you know, no further for evidence of this than 2001 and the glorious, beautiful moment of Thus Spoke Zarathustra scoring the first ape using the first tool to do the first murder.
You know, I think that's one of the more a little on the nose moments of Kubrick's career saying, you know, this is when we became man.
This is the defining moment that the apes became men and the evolution started.
This is how we were birthed in violence, in murder, by using violence to impose our will upon nature.
And that's what makes us men.
And that's what we are grappling with.
Do we reach up to the heavens?
Do we do something better than that?
Do we ever get better than that?
Or are we, you know, simply the most violent atop the food chain?
And, you know, obviously I would say that is the overarching theme of his work from Strange Love On,
is that we are begat in violence and we will end in violence and stopping throughout time to see, you know,
the 18th century enlightenment and seeing that that's the, you know, the gorgeous art and landscape of Barry Lyndon
and the edified, elevated manner in which they relate to each other.
And the idea that these are enlightened people is, of course, underscored by just horrific oppression.
You can't build the Palace of Versailles without slaves.
You can't build these things.
You can't have these nice lives where you ponder life without someone suffering on the other side of the world for it.
And it's all, you know, we'll get into that with the Barry Lyndon episode.
But if you look at these last seven movies, Kubrick looks, you know, literally from the beginning of time to the end of time
and stops at the 18th century enlightenment and looks ahead to, you know, future London
and finds the same idea everywhere.
And that's what I want to talk about with this series.
But then when you look at specifically these last four movies, or these last seven movies,
four of them are specifically based in America, a place he would no longer go from 1964 on the rest of his life.
If you look at Dr. Strangelove, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket, and Eyes Wide Shut,
it's clear that he's saying something specific about America too.
And that's where my initial title for this series, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Reich, comes in.
I think you can trace very much the idea through these four movies about America with, again,
with The Shining being kind of the apex and the crowning achievement, which is why it's my favorite.
This painting that specifically America is the Fourth Reich.
That specifically America is, like I said, this dark star apotheosis of mankind's violence.
That we figured out a way to implement fascism, meaning the politics of violence,
again, the politics of taking what you want and killing whoever gets in the way.
We found a way to implement that within liberalism, and obviously now within neoliberalism,
within a world that views itself as edified and enlightened,
and the world leaders, the cultural leaders, the ones setting the trends,
and the best country on earth with the highest standard of living, blah, blah, blah.
It's all underscored by this horrific violence, and this horrific fascism,
and this devotion to this dark star.
And that is what The Shining is about, specifically.
And that is the story he was trying to tell of America.
Now, it's fascinating, and I didn't even know this when I started watching his movies
and trying to learn about them and kind of developing this idea as I'm watching them.
A lot of people know Jan Harlan was Kubrick's production partner from Clockwork Orange On.
And they also probably know, you've seen in behind-the-scenes stuff and interviews,
about his wife, Christiane Kubrick.
What they may not realize is Christiane Kubrick was Suzanne Christiane,
who is the singer at the end of Pass of Glory in the tavern.
She's billed as Suzanne Christiane, possibly in that movie,
because she was born Christiane Suzanne Harlan.
She is the sister of Jan Harlan.
And they are the niece and nephew of Weid Harlan,
who is the Nazi-era filmmaker,
who made the movie, I believe it's pronounced Seuss the Jew,
I believe it's Sweetie the Jew,
a deeply anti-Semitic propaganda film
that was praised by none other than Goebbels himself.
There's no question the Nazi influence hung over Kubrick's life and work.
I mean, he's married to the niece of a Nazi filmmaker.
And this is a man deeply interested in violence and fascism
and themes of Nazis and the Reich appear, again, from the use of Wagner.
And thus spoke Zarathustra to score the first murder up through Clockwork Orange,
up through The Shining, up through Eyes Wide Shut.
You know, it's fascinating that I read on the Wikipedia,
Christiane, she married Stanley, who is obviously Jewish,
and Weid's own daughter, Suzanne Korber,
converted to Judaism and married the son of Holocaust victims,
then committed suicide in 1989.
God damn.
There was a whole lot going on in that family.
And I think it's kind of impossible to view his work,
knowing that and then seeing this evidence and reading these quotes from him.
You know, I think it's impossible to kind of view his work
outside of the context of him seeing America as the Fourth Reich
and him seeing it as this apex of man's violence.
And it scared the shit out of him and he never came back.
And I think he made The Shining specifically about it.
And that's what we're about to get into.
So basically, after the long-ass intro about myself,
which I'll never do again,
I wanted to give an introduction on why I'm starting with this series of Kubrick
and the kind of thesis and idea that I want to focus on.
This idea of the Fourth Reich and his movies being about
this arc of mankind beginning and ending in violence.
And with that said, how I want to do these episodes from now on,
I kind of want to start with an overview like this,
and we're going to get into now an overview of The Shining itself,
talk about specifically the themes.
And then I'm going to do kind of a running commentary where I'm just going to watch the movies
and stop it and talk about scenes I like and things I like and specific moments.
And yeah, so hopefully you'll enjoy it.
And to end this overview of Kubrick, I think, again,
this theory is all best summed up by a quote from the narration of Barry Lyndon,
which says,
Gentlemen may talk of the age of chivalry,
but remember the plowmen, poachers, and pickpockets whom they lead.
It is with these sad instruments that your great warriors and kings
have been doing their murderous work in the world.
So, The Shining, let's get into it.
Obviously, this is not going to be a plot summary podcast or a production trivia podcast.
We would both just be reading the same Wikipedia pages,
so I'm not going to do that.
But there will obviously be plot spoilers in these overview and commentary parts of these podcasts.
So, if you haven't seen the movie yet, stop now.
Watch it first, and then come back and listen to the rest if you want to.
But The Shining.
So, how does this work into this overall idea of the Fourth Reich
and the kind of overarching theme of violence as man's truest characteristic?
You might say, you know, this is a horror classic.
It's a story about a family who gets locked in a hotel for the winter,
and the dad goes crazy, and it's about cabin fever and alcoholism.
And that is very much what the Stephen King book that it's based on is about.
But, of course, Kubrick, with his plot world, melody, chords dynamic,
made it about something much more.
And obviously, this movie has been written about to death.
I don't need to go into all the theories and all the symbolism that you can see.
But it is a movie about America.
It is a movie specifically about America
and the dark heart of violence that runs underneath it.
You know, the Overlook Hotel is America.
It is a conquering, colonizing force that is jutting out into wild nature
and imposing its will.
You know, as Stuart Ullman, who we'll get into during the commentary,
says it's built on a Native American burial ground.
You know, it's pretty obviously this frontier,
what America represented,
the frontier being paved over the graves of the dead,
the people who are unfortunate enough to stand in the way of the American idea and the project.
In this movie, you know, it's thought to be about a haunted place.
But Kubrick talks about, in Stanley Kubrick's archives,
about the shining, not to him being a magical thing,
but more being the ability to see the past, the present, and the future all at once.
The ability to understand and see the bodies that the Overlook is paved over
and quite literally see the river of blood that is flowing underneath the heart of America.
You know, once you understand these movies in the context,
that's why the river of blood shot in The Shining to me is my favorite shot, I think.
If I had to pick one shot, you said, make one poster,
and that's the only film scene you ever get to put on a poster on a wall.
I'd pick the river of blood, because I think that's, you know,
it's both this thing that just became a meme, you know,
it's parodied in The Simpsons and Family Guy and shit,
and also it's this incredibly powerful, just unbelievable moment of Kubrick
using The Shining to show you the river of blood that runs underneath America
and runs underneath this world that you thought was built on some kind of enlightenment,
some kind of liberalism, some kind of agreement to be better than just violent animals.
So if you watch the movie with that context,
it's a lot more interesting than watching a movie about a haunted mansion
and someone who can see ghosts, you know, it's really someone who can see
the past and the present, and therefore can understand what's going to happen in the future.
I know people that I think have The Shining, you know,
not in any metaphysical or spiritual way,
but literally just are people who live with the past, the present, and the future all at once.
They can see it all. They can see the big picture.
And it's a much more interesting reading of the movie and what it's about than it being about magic
and horror and ghosts and stuff.
Really, the only magic, you could argue, I think Kubrick may have said something about this,
or maybe it's written about in that book,
but the only magic that really happens is the freezer door unlocking for Jack.
Otherwise, everything in that movie can be read as just the ability to see what happened here in the past
and what's going to happen in the future.
It's not a movie about magic. It's not about being haunted by ghosts.
And Jack doesn't exactly go crazy.
It's thought to be a movie about cabin fever and alcoholism and an abusive father,
and it is about that.
But the idea that Jack is stored up, you know, pent up in this place all winter,
and he goes crazy, that's not exactly what happens.
Jack is more aspiring to be a servant of the power
that exists in and underneath and all around the overlook,
and therefore America.
You know, he doesn't go crazy.
He detects this system of power and this system of order
that naturally he conforms to,
and he naturally is attracted to.
You know, it's quite literally defined by Grady
when he meets him in the bathroom,
and he talks about having to correct his children.
They need to be corrected according to this system of power,
and the system of power is the dark star that lies at the heart of America.
It is this path of consumption and destruction,
this path of taking what you want and imposing your will.
And what's fascinating to me is, like, you know, Kubrick focuses on Jack.
Jack is not the evil spirit.
Jack is not the dark star.
He is middle management for evil.
I think there's a great statement there
that the true fucking bastards of this world are the middle managers,
the ones who give in to their fear,
and they make a deal with the devil to be stewards of power.
I think it's vital that we focus on Jack,
and you see, you know, he views himself as a steward of power,
and what he does toward his wife and child,
he's only correcting their path back towards the path of the dark star.
You know, he sees himself again as this steward of power,
almost like this, you know, Noah with his ark out in the American wilderness,
trying to keep the ship afloat against these, you know,
the deadly tides of wildlife, of anything outside the plan.
And it's famously, you know, signified by the scene where he sits down with Lloyd
and says, the white man's burden, Lloyd, white man's burden.
You know, he thinks he has this burden of taking care of this world
and making it conform back to order.
And what's great is, you know, Kubrick, if you take a step back,
Kubrick has very little sympathy for almost all of his characters,
but he might have the least sympathy for Jack,
because Jack views himself as this servant of power.
In reality, he is a misogynistic, abusive pedophile
who thinks he's a true crusader,
but he's ultimately too weak and stupid to even kill his wife.
His wife physically bests him twice,
and his son outsmarts him and leads him to his grave in the snow.
You know, the last shot of Jack is supposed to be funny.
A lot of people didn't get that.
A lot of people thought, oh, that looks ridiculous.
That's, what is he doing?
It's supposed to be funny.
It's this comment on how ridiculously futile and harebrained Jack is,
and how weak and what a failure he is at his idea of being a servant of power.
But then obviously you see that's this bigger,
larger comment on the white man and his burden,
and what has become of white men in America
and their genocidal colonial roots.
And I think that, you know,
directly ties into this idea of the Fourth Reich,
and modern America being the Fourth Reich,
and that the white man's burden,
you know, these people view themselves as crusaders for some power.
In reality, they're middle managers.
They're CIA agents and FBI agents and politicians
who are kind of middle managers, stewards for evil,
just as long as they get their paycheck,
and their stocks say okay,
and their pedophile island,
and their pedophile jet stays under,
you know, within their power.
They're okay with being kind of a middle manager.
And I think that's directly tied into this idea of
hashism as the dark face underneath the smiling face of neoliberalism,
that you get to have a cushy middle management job
watching this hotel,
and it's a hotel where, you know,
politicians and kings rape children
and murder the natives and built it on top of their bones.
So I think it's kind of vital to understand the shining in this way,
that the overlook is America.
And it possesses a great evil,
and it's built on top of a great evil.
And that Jack,
him going crazy is him heeding the call to power from this
and looking to make a deal with the devil
and be a middle manager for evil.
And that the shining is Danny
kind of simply being able to see what happened there in the past
and know what's going to happen again here in the future,
much like Kubrick,
and much like the idea that whatever we do,
violence defined our path.
Violence is where we were born,
and violence is where we're headed.
And however we want to pretend that that's true or not,
to what degree we want to pretend that's true or not,
or how edified we are,
doesn't make a difference.
Now, all that said,
about the world,
you know, the plot and the melody matters to Kubrick too.
That's one of the things I love about Kubrick.
I can't remember the exact quote,
but there's some quote in that book to the effect of like,
he was talking to some other writer about writing
and saying,
said,
you know,
try to say something,
try to do something profound,
but you have to do something entertaining.
Do something interesting,
for God's sake at least.
So, you know,
he's not one to neglect the plot,
melody,
or the,
you know,
what's happening on screen
and making an interesting movie.
And, you know,
this movie is about pedophilia
and domestic abuse
and spousal abuse.
And it's a lot about,
you know,
what happens when the person
who's supposed to be your protector
and safekeeper
turns into your predator.
And, you know,
Wendy and Danny
are two of the only
kind of characters made
in earnest
in Kubrick's work
and two of the few characters
he ever treats with any sympathy.
Most characters are
kind of ironic or satirical,
you know,
portrayals of an idea
or a type of person
or someone that Kubrick deems,
you know,
hateful or usually a bad person.
And Wendy and Danny
are treated with actual care
by this movie
and actually it invests
in their survival
and why they matter.
And that's one of the reasons
I love it too.
And I know, you know,
we're not going to do,
talk about the hellish production
of The Shining.
And obviously,
I think Shelley Duvall
is unbelievable
and I think it's one of the great
performances of all time
as the wife
who is deeply traumatized
and abused
but trying to keep it together
and put on a face
to the world
just desperately
trying to bridge
her schisming life
with duct tape,
you know,
and she's incredible in it.
And I know, obviously,
it was an incredibly difficult shoot
and it was incredibly hard for her
and, you know,
famously so,
of them doing hundreds
and hundreds of takes.
The only thing I'll say about that
is in regards to the movie,
I've always felt like there is,
I've always felt like
there's kind of a
autobiographical part
to The Shining
and especially Eyes Wide Shut.
It's always felt
in some ways that Kubrick,
I don't know,
with The Shining,
I've always felt like Kubrick,
there's a lot of Jack in Kubrick
and that was him kind of
diagnosing a lot of the parts
he hated about himself
and a lot of the parts
he saw as kind of
unjustifiable and evil
and it almost felt like
the production of The Shining,
him putting himself
and everybody else there
in the overlook
for a year and a half
or whatever
and make him do a hundred takes
of picking up a cup of coffee.
It almost felt like
an act of penance
or an act of self-punishment
that's really interesting to view
within the context
of his later work
and we'll talk a lot more
about that in the last episode
about Eyes Wide Shut.
That said,
I think that's enough
to set the stage
of what this movie is
and what it's trying to do
and I think
let's get into the commentary.
Let's run it.
It may be obvious to say
at this point
but it's very cool
that the movie starts
with a helicopter shot
across the lake
from the very first second
of this movie
the camera is quite literally
pulling you in.
It's from the very beginning
there is the dark heart
of the overlook
and it is pulling you
and Jack and Wendy
and Danny in
and you are
on a tractor beam
towards it.
Obviously this movie,
I'm not going to go
into all the production details
but it was revolutionary
with the use of Steadicam
with the inventor
of Steadicam,
Garrett Brown,
shooting the movie
and it's really cool
how,
obviously,
how Kubrick uses the camera
to just enhance the effect
of The Shining
and make you feel,
like literally
from frame one
with the incredible
Wendy Carlos soundtrack.
Wendy Carlos
and Rachel Elkind,
I believe is her name.
Yeah,
that you're just being
pulled in
from the first shot.
Like you,
I never had any choice.
This thing was always there
and it's,
this is the real heart
of America
and it's,
your entire journey
is leading to this.
Now we get
to the interview
and I have to shout out
my best friend Lee
watching this movie
with her
the first time
helped me see
a bunch of stuff
I never saw
in this scene
and what's fascinating
is a lot of the story
is told right in this scene
specifically with
Jack and Stuart Ullman's
tie and jacket combinations.
Now first of all,
he walks in
and he meets Stuart Ullman.
Stuart,
of course,
a name derived
from the word Stuart
which we will get
a lot more into
and Ullman,
a name of Austrian descent.
Now Kubrick,
if you look through his movies
there's a whole lot
done with names
and a whole lot of clues
and names
and their origins
and what they mean
and Stuart Ullman
being the head
of the Overlook Hotel.
Now you look at him
in the interview,
he is wearing
very specifically
red,
white,
and blue.
He's got
a blue suit,
a white shirt
with stripes,
and a big red tie
and his big red tie
the knot on it
is huge
and if you look at it
the knot
resembled a heart
and the tie
resembles
a river of blood
pouring down
from the heart.
Now you look across
to Jack,
look at what he's wearing.
He is wearing
a blue shirt
with a checkered pattern
and then a green tie
with a felt
kind of mossy
square pattern
almost like
ice cubes
in the labyrinth.
kind of
a little hint
and little signal
of where
Jack may be headed.
It's this green
grassy tie
surrounded by
icy blue cubes
and of course
he ends up
an ice cube
in the labyrinth.
And then if you look
at the suit and tie
of Bill Watson
his tie looks like
a kind of
cosmic sunburst.
There's this kind of
star
burst
quality to it
and then
in his pocket
he's specifically
got a little
black
rectangular
thing.
I don't know
what it is.
Is it a pin protector?
It's something.
It looks like
the monolith
from 2001.
And I think
that, you know,
knowing the
2001 soundtrack
is in the record store
at Clockwork Orange
I almost think
that was a
cheeky little nod
from Kubrick
doing this whole thing
with the ties
of Ullman and Jack
and then also a little
hey I also made 2001.
You know,
this movie
and Kubrick's movies
in general
I made at such
a level of detail
that I could sit here
and, you know,
diagnose.
There seemed to be
some kind of,
you know,
Mesoamerican
or prehistoric
tools on Ullman's desk.
There's something
going on with that
weird clock
on the wall.
There's a mug
on his desk
that could be
some Freemason
type shit.
Who knows?
But to me
I want to focus
on the stuff
that's important
and intentional
to the story
and not
try to not get
lost in the weeds
here.
And one thing
that's obviously
great about
all Kubrick's movies
is every actor
he gets
is so good
especially in
the small roles
and the incredible
performance of
Barry Nelson
as Stuart Ullman.
He's so good
in just these
few scenes
and the,
you know,
the thing that's
remarkable about
the interview scene
and the way
he shows them
around the hotel
is it's
so cordial,
it's so gentlemanly
and,
well,
he seemed like
a great guy
and we can't wait
and then
they sprinkle in
also the last guy
we got to do
a job
went crazy
and killed
his family
with an axe
and also
the hotel's
built on,
you know,
we had to
repel several
Native American
attacks.
I think it's
actually built
on one of
their burial
sites.
And then,
of course,
the next line
is,
you guys know
how to use
an automobile?
Like,
it's so
well done
to sprinkle in,
you know,
it's this
American world
we live in
built on violence,
built on death
that we all
know is there
and we all
agree to kind
of keep going
and keep it
under the surface
and there's
regretful moments
when we have
to acknowledge,
yes,
the last guy
murdered his
family,
yes,
we have mass
shootings every
day,
yes,
people have to
suffer around
the world
for us to
have our
quality of
life,
but,
you know,
the skiing is
probably great
here in the
winter.
And I love
the way at the
end of the
interview,
when Olman asks
Jack about,
you know,
do you think
your wife will
enjoy it?
And there's
this look of
confusion on
Jack's face
and he's like,
she'll love it.
You can tell
he's never
thought about it.
He didn't think
about it one time.
All he wants
is status.
This guy's an
alcoholic loser,
a writer who's
not published,
a teacher who's
been laid off,
beats his wife,
child.
You can tell
he's, you know,
intoxicated with
the idea of
having status,
even just the
shitty middle
management status
of,
I'm gonna watch
an empty hotel
through the winter
and obviously
the parallel,
the middle
manager for
evil.
I'm gonna be,
you know,
you're not the
king.
It's not real
status.
It's middle
management level
status and
that's what
Jack wants
because he's
a fucking
loser.
Once again,
I won't,
you know,
rhapsodize over
the performances.
It's all been
said and done
before but
Jack Nicholson
is just born
to play this
role,
born to play
the white
man's burden
and it's,
I love,
he goes places
that are very
dangerous and
vulnerable for an
actor.
A lot of
actors really
protect themselves
in their roles
and they never
really like to
look uncool or
like a fucking
misogynistic,
racist,
abusive husband
and really take
themselves to
that place.
And this,
the same way it
felt almost like
an act of
penance for
Kubrick to put
himself through
this, it almost
feels like Jack
Nicholson getting
all his
assuredly mini
demons out in
this movie and
he's just
unbelievable.
They're all
incredible.
Danny is so
good.
It might be the
best child
performance in a
movie.
He's so subtle
and so both a
combination of
like incredibly
sweet and innocent
and also completely
haunted and yeah,
he's great.
And I do love that
11 minutes,
45 seconds in,
Kubrick goes to
the river of
blood.
He knew that of
all his great
Kubrick one-point
perspective shots.
That was the
fucking one.
And I love that
that's the first
thing Tony slash
The Shining shows
Danny.
He immediately
sees the whole
thing.
He immediately
sees how this
started and how
it's going to end.
And then this
brings us to the
incredible scene
with Anne Jackson
as the doctor.
Yet another just
phenomenal performance.
The look on her
fucking face after
the long single
shot of Shelley
Duvall, of
Wendy telling the
story of what
happened to
Danny.
The look on her
face is just all
time unbelievable.
Just incredible
performance.
But when Danny
passes out, this is
one of the first
important clues again
to what this movie
is fucking about
and how it ties
into, especially
Eyes Wide Shut.
Now if you notice
after Danny passes
out and the
doctor's meeting him,
look at what he's
lying on on his
bed.
It's a giant bear
face.
It's one big giant
bear pillow.
And if you look,
when they move
into the apartment
in the overlook,
look over Danny's
bed, it's a painting
of a dancing bear.
And of course,
as we know later,
when the shining's
becoming so strong
that everyone can
see it, Wendy and
Jack can see it too,
she sees the bear
blowing the elite
member of society
in the hotel room.
We can assume that
guy to be elite,
maybe even royalty,
as Wendy asks
Stuart Ullman,
has any royalty ever
stayed here?
And he says,
all the best people.
There's a clear
parallel between
Danny's bedroom
being filled with
bears and then a
bear in the bedroom
having sex with a
member of elite
society.
I think it's
obviously clear
there's a thing
Kubrick couldn't
show but was very
interested in.
And I think it's a
huge theme in The
Shining and Eyes
Wide Shut,
elite pedophilia.
I think Eyes
Wide Shut is more
or less about the
Jeffrey Epstein,
Prince Andrew world.
that movie doesn't
really make sense
without that
understanding of it.
And we'll get to
that later.
But there's a clear
parallel drawn here
in the first scene.
Danny's the bear.
Danny's being both
molested by his
father and children
in the overlook
have been molested
and raped by
elite pedophiles.
And that has been
a bonding system
and a secret society
in the overlook
since the beginning
time with all
the best people.
It's interesting
in this scene too
that Wendy is
wearing almost
red, white, and blue
too.
It's a blue
checkered pattern
with technically
light blue.
But it's very red
and blue and it's
very ill-fitting.
She doesn't look
stylish the way
she does later
in the movie.
And of course
later in the movie
she starts wearing
more and more
Navajo prints
and patterns
and Native
American patterns.
And I think
that's one of the
keys in Kubrick's
movies.
Especially you look
at this and
Clockwork Orange
and Eyes Wide Shut
as well.
The people who
are colonizers
and gentrifiers
are liberals.
They're hip.
They're not
conservative
war hawks.
They're young
hip liberals.
He's a teacher
and she's a cool
70s mom.
Or 1980s
but end of 70s
whatever.
They're very much
hip and stylish
and as she becomes
more stylish
she becomes more
gentrifying.
She's a gentrifier
too even though
she's kind of
the emotional
heart and center
of the movie.
I guess Danny
is really
but she's the
sympathetic one
you hope.
The only one
who has a chance
to save Danny.
It's very interesting
that Kubrick's
kind of
some of the most
villainous people
in his story
are fucking
neoliberals
who think that
they're edified
and think that
they're
you know
bohemian
and intelligent
and of course
their lives
are propped up
on just
endless
fascistic
violence.
Now I could
go on forever
about Shelley
Duvall
and her
goddamn
cigarette
in this scene
but she is
just
heartbreaking
and so good
in this movie.
She's got a
rag doll quality
to her
that
this raggedy
Ann
just sad
doll eyes
that Kubrick
uses really well
and you really
feel how vulnerable
she is in this
situation
while she's trying
to make it work.
She's incredible
in this scene
I don't know
about the Oscars
I don't know
if she got an Oscar
but she should have
got an Oscar
for this fucking scene
where she's clearly
covering up the fact
that the abuse
of Danny and her
was much worse
than she's saying
you know
just the type of thing
you do a thousand times
with a child
and it just popped out.
She's incredible
in this scene
but what I want to talk
about in this scene
is this book
that's on the table
between them
and it's kind of
the one that's most
prominently turned
towards the camera
the one that you can read.
You want to talk
about the Fourth Reich
again
let's look at this book
it's called
The Wish Child
by Ina I believe
Seidel
okay this book
by Ina Seidel
The Wish Child
it is a book
about a mother
trying to save her child
during the Prussian Wars
during the Napoleonic era
and reading from
the Wikipedia page
about it
it says
this mother's
individual fate
is so closely entwined
with the destiny
of the nation
that in the end
she sacrifices
her son to it.
Okay
Ina Seidel
also wrote a book
called Das Labyrinth
about a man
who struggles
with his talent
and dies
within life's labyrinth.
She also wrote
a book called
Michaela
which was about
the guilt
of middle class Germans
who were pro
Third Reich.
Ina Seidel
in October 1933
was one of the
of course
88 authors
who signed
the vow
of total loyalty
to Adolf Hitler.
She was staunchly pro
she was a personal
friend of Hitler
she wrote him
a poem for his birthday
she was staunchly
pro Nazi
staunchly pro Reich
and then
after the Reich fell
she was embarrassed
and ashamed
and eventually
wrote that book
Michaela
trying to
deal with
her middle class
German guilt
about the Holocaust.
so
you want to talk
about the
fucking
Fourth Reich
I mean just
and again
this is the level
of detail
this movie
is made at
this book
by Ina Seidel
is
is
very specifically
chosen
to be put
between them
you know
that's
what this movie
is
it's both
a
sincere
picture
of Wendy
trying to
save her child
just like
Ina Seidel's
mother
in The Wish Child
and also
an acknowledgement
that like
this is all
underscored
by Nazi fascism
and these
these are the
neoliberal
middle class
bohemians
interfacing
with the true
face of America
the dark star
at the heart
of it
that's just
an incredible
level of
you know
it's just a little
book on a table
you might not
notice it
the first
20 times
you watch
The Shining
and you go
back and look
there's a famous
story in the
Kubrick archives
where someone
asked him
if he would
change anything
about his movies
and I believe
it was Lolita
but anyway
he talked
for a long
or yeah
he sat there
and thought
for a long
time
and then he
said
ah there's a
scene in Lolita
where one of
the guy's socks
is the wrong
color
you know
that's the
level of detail
his movies
are made at
and uh
The Wish Child
is just
another little
piece of evidence
about this idea
of America
as the
fourth Reich
there's a
great
Donner Party
scene as
they're driving
to the
Overlook
on closing
day
and uh
I just want
to make a
little note
of just
great acting
by Shelley
Duvall
at the end
of the scene
uh when
when she
kind of warns
Jack to not
talk about
how graphic
the Donner Party
was to Danny
and he says
it's okay
he saw it
on the
television
and she
does this
little smile
uh that's
just so
pitch perfect
of like
a mom
being like
I know
this is not
good but
okay I'm
gonna try
to make
the best
of it
it's just
she's incredible
in this
I just wanted
to take note
of that
and once again
on closing
day
Omen and
Watson come
to meet
Jack in the
lobby
and if you
notice
Jack is
sitting there
reading a
Playgirl
magazine
and this is
something I
had to look
up again
after my
10th
15th time
of watching
this
noticing
that
and I
was like
you know
why is
Jack ostensibly
a heterosexual
male
reading Playgirl
um
and I looked
it up
you look at
the magazine
he is reading
it is the
January 1978
issue of
Playgirl
and there
is a big
article
shown
previewed on
the cover
which says
incest
why parents
sleep with
their children
um
you can pretty
much draw
the quick
and easy
parallel there
but obviously
coming directly
after the
the Wendy
talking to
the doctor
about Jack
abusing
Danny's scene
and then
obviously
what happens
later
in room
237
and then
the whole
bear
Epstein
Prince Andrew
pedophilic
royalty
theme
all the
best people
you can see
that pedophilia
is a strong
theme
in The Shining
and kind of
a strong
theme for
Kubrick
especially
again
we'll get
to it
with eyes
wide shut
uh
I think
pedophilia
in his work
and especially
those two
movies
is specifically
a kind
of a
divination
point
a marker
that humanity
is going
downwards
and not
upwards
we're going
down towards
the mud
and not
up towards
the heavens
and the
fact that
this place
has you
know
a deep
history
of child
abuse
child murder
and child
rape
that America
is built
on the bones
of nobles
and elites
who are
pedophiles
and murderers
and genocidal
fucking maniacs
um
it all ties
in for him
and I think
there's no
there's no
mistake
that that's
a huge
theme in this
and that's
kind of
what eyes
wide shut
is about
so
now they get
to the
Colorado
lounge
and man
some people
have said
the greatest
set in film
history
it's pretty
hard to argue
and obviously
the
you know
it's dripping
in symbolism
of white
people
killing the
Native Americans
and then
decorating
their gorgeous
lounge
with their
art
and their
culture
and you
know
quite literally
using their
bones and
blood
and their
souls and
spirits
to decorate
this place
that they
stole from
them and
paved over
their bones
and obviously
that's you know
it's hard to
I don't want to
get on a whole
crazy tangent
here but
you know
it's amazing
to me that
what has
happened in
America
the genocide
of the
natives
of this
continent
in North
and South
America
was all
one thing
and it was
the land
of brown
people
like
you'll see
why I say
that in a
second
the way
Africa
is the
land
of black
people
like
anyone
with
black
blood
you know
can trace
their roots
back to
Africa
this was
the land
of brown
people
and the
thing is
like
I'm calling
them that
because we
have no
better term
for what
they are
because we
have
specifically
conquered
them
genocided
them
and then
called them
different
names
and in this
country
specifically
you know
it's just
you get
so used
to it
but how
how fucking
dark and
ugly
it is to
be from
a place
called
you know
Michigan
or Illinois
it's
you know
we named
it after
the people
we killed
and took
it from
that's
that's
incredibly
fucked up
and and
the genocide
and colonization
runs so deep
that we do
not have a
word for
what these
people are
you know
we we've
divided them
into the
ideas of
like
Native
American
and Cree
and Apache
and Cherokee
are totally
different from
Mexican
and Guatemalan
and Paraguayan
and etc
etc
it's like
no
they're all
one peoples
they were all
one peoples
that we conquered
and divided
you know
the word
that we use
for them
now
people in
South America
people south
of you know
the Mexican
American border
we call them
Hispanic
or Latino
literally
words derived
from Latin
and Spanish
European
white
colonial languages
like
those are not
those are not
their race
that's not the word
that's our word
that we use
for them
we don't know
what their word
is
we've so
deeply
thoroughly
conquered
them
you know
I guess
some people
in Mexico
I've read
at least
call themselves
like
nativos
or indios
just meaning
natives
or indigenous
people
but the
process of
colonization
and gentrification
and the genocide
that you know
some people
estimate to be
100 to 150
million
you know
more or less
brown people
from Canada
all the way
down to
Argentina
over the
several hundred
years of
colonization
of this
continent
that we now
think of as
two continents
but it's
we get so
used to this
world that we
live in that
we cannot
forget you
know this is
stolen land
named after the
people we killed
and buried here
and that's you
know obviously
the parallel
with the
Colorado Lounge
and that's
they marvel at
what does
Wendy say
it's about the
most beautiful
place I've ever
even seen
she's so
innocent and
sweet about it
my gosh
look at it
the designs
isn't that so
liberalism
don't we love
to define
ourselves as
liberal and
bohemians in
America
by consuming
world culture
I had that
thought recently
god you know
I was at
Trader Joe's
and it's like
they got organic
garlic naan
crackers
and it's like
as we consume
more and more
stuff from
around the
world and
think that
Marxist is
more liberal
and more
bohemian
and more
edified
it only happens
because we're
spreading more
oppression
and more
fascism
and more
violence
and more
fucking
colonization
and gentrification
like you know
in the 90s
it suddenly became
a thing to be
into world music
looking back
at that
it's like
that's about
one step away
from saying
I'm into
black music
like calling it
world music
is almost
disrespectful
but people
mark themselves
as liberalistic
with that
they celebrated
it and if you
are a bohemian
guy who watches
the Oscars
and reads
the New York
Times
you listen to
world music
in 1993
I think it's
no mistake
that as
Americans
specifically
define themselves
more and more
as non-American
and I'm different
I'm liberal
I'm intelligent
I'm educated
it's by
interfacing with
other cultures
that only
happens more
and more
as we are
destroying
those other
cultures
so the
Colorado
lounge
being the
most beautiful
place
the most
beautiful room
Wendy's ever
been in
is so
heartbreakingly
accurate
that's what's
tough
because it's
like Wendy's
a sweet
person
I love her
I want her
to do well
but Kubrick's
right
and you know
your fucking
mom and your
aunt and your
women at your
country club
may be very
sweet people
and you may
love them
but they're
also
benefiters
of genocide
and colonialism
and are the
beneficiaries
of that
and yeah
that's the
Colorado lounge
for you
and of course
I already
mentioned it
but the same
with Ullman
saying we had
jet setters here
before there even
was a jet set
four presidents
lots of movie
stars and then
Wendy asks royalty
and he says
all the best
people
once you kind
of see this
movie in this
context
I can't read
it as any
other way
of Kubrick
kind of going
down this
list
and indicting
these people
yeah they
stayed at the
overlook too
they did what
people do here
too
murder and
genocide and
rape and
pedophilia
and they've
been doing it
since there was
before there was
a jet set
we call them
jet setters
now
before they knew
what a fucking
jet was
back to Barry
Lyndon
you know
they've been
doing this for
a whole long
time
kind of
coinciding
with the
enlightenment
and people
thinking of
themselves as
liberal
liberalized
edified
educated
people
you know
you can't
read that
scene
as any
other way
but an
indictment
of movie
stars
presidents
oh yeah
they were
all here
too
and it's
just a
great note
I don't
know if
it's in
the script
or Jack
Nicholson
just did
it but
as they
enter the
apartment
he checks
out the
two hot
chicks
walking
by
just a
perfect
scumbag
fucking
shitty
boomer
dad
move
and then
of course
they get
to the
apartment
you see
you can
see it's
two bears
kind of
dancing
in the
painting
above
Danny's
bed
in the
line
right after
of course
is Jack
saying
perfect
for a
child
so
there you
go
obviously
a lot
has been
made
about
Kubrick's
use
of
dissolves
in this
movie
it's
iconic
and he
he used
it for
the rest
of his
career
he uses
them a lot
in
Full Metal
Jack and
Eyes Wide
Shut
and clearly
saw how
powerful they
could be
here
and the
great
dissolve
at the
end of
the
apartment
scene
of
Jack
and
Wendy
standing
there
smiling
in
their
American
bohemian
clothes
start to
change
more and
more
as they're
here
at the
overlook
as they
start to
gentrify
look like
the
perfect
hip
1979
1980
couple
it's
like
this
little
you know
American
gothic
little
portrait
and
Jack
just
making
a
demented
smile
Nicholson
really
went to
some
deep
places
and
came up
with
some
of
the
most
demonic
faces
and
it's
just
a
great
little
those
are
those
fun
moments
you know
people
think
Kubrick's
so
dense
and coy
and
mysterious
and dark
and the
dark
secrets
but
he's
extremely
funny
his
sense
of
comedic
timing
you know
his movies
are almost
as funny
as they
are serious
a lot
of times
obviously
Strange 11
Lolita
and his
early stuff
is extremely
funny
and
this movie
especially
is along
with how
fucking
dark
and tragic
and
just
bleak
it is
it's also
incredibly
funny
and
a lot
of the
source
of comedy
is that
he treats
Jack
with just
absolutely
no pity
or sympathy
so
it's great
to see
him and
Nicholson
buy into
that together
and Nicholson
go to
these
demented
fucking
vulnerable
places
where he
really looks
like a
fucking
weirdo
and a
creep
and
doesn't
protect
himself
in the
way
other
actors
would
so
that's
great
Scantman
Crothers
enters
Halloran
he's great
in this
and it's
great that
at first
it seems
very much
like the
cliched
magical
black
older
kind
gentleman
who
is kind
to the
guy
and then
that's why
I put it
at the
beginning
then the
second Danny
is
what about
room 237
you see
everything
change
and it's
very cool
that Kubrick
did that
and Halloran
becomes a
real character
after that
and Halloran
is really
the hero
of the movie
Wendy's the
protagonist
and the
one we pull
for
but Halloran
is the
hero
he is
the
ultimate
you know
the whole
sequence
of this
old man
flying across
the country
and driving
through this
horrific ice
storm
8 hours
10 hours
12 hours
just to get
up to this
hotel
just to
maybe help
these people
it's beautiful
and heroic
and obviously
there's a
parallel there
with him
being the
only black
character
in the movie
and then
specifically
kind of
vilely
referred to
as a
slur
by Grady
and Jack
later
in a way
that always
feels out of
place
in specific
I've always
thought
that's because
it's a
suggestion
that Kubrick
is saying
here that
black people
are heroic
in the story
of America
that if he's
an analog
for slavery
he's the
hotel servant
he's the
kind servant
that shows
them everything
and does
everything
for them
he sacrifices
himself to
save the
wife and
child
against the
white master
and I
think there's
a whole
there's obviously
a whole lot
there and
there's a
whole lot
to
to
Scatman's
performance
that is
it's just
cool how it
creeps up on
you you think
it's going to
be kind of
cliche and
then it
ends up
being a
much more
interesting
character and
he's great
with Danny
so it's also
obviously like a
different time
and
it's
but it's
still crazy
that Wendy
and Jack
leave Danny
with Halloran
after just
meeting him
I know
that's something
people used to
do but even
Kubrick
Kubrick was very
family oriented
and kept his
family close to
him on shoots
and stuff
and it's almost
it always still
feels like a
little moment
they're like
oh yeah
they're kind
of shitty
parents too
like they're
trying to pull
it together
or at least
Wendy's trying
to pull it
together for him
but they're
also kind of
just selfish
neglectful people
Danny's really
great in this
movie and it's
cool how
if you notice
after Halloran
calls him Doc
he just stares
at him
he looks like
such a little
kid just kind
of fascinated
by an older
person suddenly
and feels
really genuine
and the way
he plays this
scene with
Halloran
with the ice
cream
is so good
Danny's got
such quiet
power
just the way
he asked about
room 237
he's giving
less information
than Halloran
is
which is
very cool
and very
well written
for a scene
between an
old man
and a young
boy
he's just
great in it
I forgot to
say earlier
too but when
Danny's talking
about Tony
it's fucked
up and scary
that he has
a specific
answer for
where Tony
lives and
where Tony
goes when
he hides
it's weird
and scary
and so well
done that
he thinks
Tony lives
in his mouth
and when Tony
hides and
goes away
he goes
it's not some
little kid
thing
you can tell
it's not
some
I don't
know
I think
he flies
away
or something
you know
it's
no he goes
to my stomach
I feel it
I know
specifically
that's just
good writing
and just
fucking
always
scared me
now we get
to a month
later
and I love
what Kubrick
does with the
title cards
of this movie
it's so great
that this is
Kubrick's horror
movie you know
and kind of
to this point
horror was a
B genre
and was thought
of as you know
schlock
and Roger Corman
and you know
John Carpenter
just got
started going
with Halloween
and stuff
and it
when people
heard Kubrick
was doing
a horror movie
it was kind
of like
oh really
he's doing
some kind
of grindhouse
B movie
thing
but then
obviously
he kind of
perfected
and elevated
the genre
but it's great
that in Kubrick's
horror movie
the biggest jump
scare is a title
card that says
Tuesday
that's like
the biggest
got you
moment
and it's very
cool what he
does with the
title cards
how it starts
out
the interview
the closing
day
a month later
and then suddenly
it's Monday
Tuesday
Wednesday
8 a.m.
4 p.m.
like it gets
smaller and
smaller increments
of time
like you're
getting closer
and closer
to the horrible
dark star
underneath the
shining
I mean
excuse me
underneath
the Overlook
hotel
that's
inevitable
and going
to happen
then we get
to the
classic
four-wheeler
shot with
Danny
and I won't
go into
the crazy
detail
because I
don't know
anything
that I'm
talking about
but what I
do know
is this
scene's
just an
incredible
example
of how
just
fucking
perfect
and all
encompassing
Kubrick's
filmmaking
can be
and this
scene's a
huge flex
if people
don't realize
the Steadicam
was not
popularized
at this
time
it was either
handheld
which was
obviously
shaky
or it
was on
a track
which was
smooth
and you
could do
tracking
shots
but then
a track
had to
be
you have
to hide
the track
so it's
not in
the shot
and what
obviously
in this
shot
people hadn't
seen the
Steadicam
before
and in
this shot
it's Kubrick
and Garrett
Brown
who shot
this movie
and was
the Steadicam
inventor
it's very
cool that
Kubrick
just said
hey
I'm gonna
call the
guy who
invented
the Steadicam
you just
come shoot
my movie
and John
Alcott
will DP
it but
hold the
camera
because you
know
what you're
doing
the shot
goes in
360 degrees
so it's
very subtly
showing you
there is
no track
so filmmakers
saw this
and they're
like how
the fuck
is he doing
this in
1980
people who
didn't know
what the
Steadicam
was or
never used
one
but the
thing is
that's all
well and
cool and
a cool
technical
trick
but Kubrick
then specifically
uses it
to make a
point that
something's
following Danny
it's the
shining
you're watching
this
you're watching
Danny from the
perspective of
the shining
from behind
him and over
his shoulder
and the way
you know the way
they space out
the carpets
so it sounds
like a drumroll
it's like
of the wheels
going over
between the
carpets and the
wood
it's just
just fucking
filmmaking
perfection
and really
shows you
it's not just
you know
great shots
and technique
and lighting
it's doing that
for a purpose
it's showing you
the shining
following Danny
around
it's showing
you how
fucking
vulnerable
and small
he is
you know
doing it
shooting it
so low
to the ground
Danny's what
two feet
three feet tall
in this movie
like how
small and
vulnerable
he is in
this huge
vaunted
Colorado lounge
and the kind
of snaking
hallways around
it
and yeah
it's just
one of his
crowning
achievement
shots
it's a
it's a
classic
and obviously
he just uses
the steadicam
and different
camera techniques
the whole time
to kind of
imbue the sense
of somebody
watching them
the shining
watching them
you're seeing
this through
this perspective
now this is
one of my
favorite little
scenes in the
whole movie
Jack tells
Wendy he can't
go to the
labyrinth
with her and
Danny
because he
wants to
work
all day
and it
cuts to
obviously
his blank
typewriter
and you just
hear this
banging noise
and then
pulls out
to see
Jack
launching
his baseball
off the
wall
in the
big
I guess
Navajo
or Apache
mural
in the
Colorado
lounge
and what's
fascinating
to me
about this
scene
it's kind
of a
scene
that you
can only
do
in film
like if
you wrote
this in
a book
it's like
an aside
while the
plot's
happening
the camera
wanders
over
and we
see that
once again
Jack doesn't
go crazy
Jack's been
fucking crazy
Jack just
heeds the
call to
power
obviously
all work
and no
play
makes
Jack a
dull
boy
he's been
quote unquote
crazy
the whole
fucking
time
but we
see
he said
I gotta
work
he's not
working
and he's
instead
doing
very
metaphorical
banging
his
American
baseball
off the
beautiful
Navajo
mural
and you
only hear
this sound
if you
wrote that
in a
book
it would
take
the
reader's
eye
and mind
to the
scene
a little
bit
more
than
it
does
in
a
movie
because
in
a
movie
you
can
just
have
it
happen
and
it's
not
part
of the
plot
it's
not
it doesn't
put an
emphasis
on it
it's just
like the
camera wanders
away for a
second
while Wendy
and Danny
are having
their day in
the labyrinth
and shows
you
how
pointless
and evil
this man
is
there's
just so
much
incredible
writing
in Kubrick's
movies
too
as
Wendy
and Danny
are running
out
she says
the loser
has to
keep
America
clean
there's
just so
much
meaning
packed
in there
and the
idea
that
became
a
patron
cause
of
Native
Americans
as
they're
running
over
a
Native
American
burial
ground
with
a
white
genocidal
hotel
pasted
on top
of it
it's
very
ironic
and
tragic
and dark
and also
funny
but that's
one thing
I love
about Kubrick
he was
in a lot
of ways
a writer
first
and
to him
the script
was everything
to him
people marveled
at the
perfection
of his
filmmaking
in every
single
detail
and to him
I think
his big
skill
was just
he saw
the script
in whole
and he
just went
and shot
the script
accurately
that's why
every detail
was right
in his
mind
and why
he could
be demanding
because he
understood
the script
fully
he was
an incredible
reader
he was
incredibly
perceptive
and he
got what
a script
was about
and it's
interesting
that he
wrote all
his movies
but especially
all the last
seven are
all adaptations
it's very
cool
it's very cool
for someone
who valued
writing so
much
and saw
that
the writing
is the
spine
and brain
of the
movie
that's the
thing
that it
all forms
from
and for
someone that
valued writing
that much
to also
know his
limitations
and be like
now my
ideas are
whatever
what I can
do is
take someone
else's idea
and expand
upon it
and once again
like we talked
about not just
tell the story
tell one story
but you tell
one story
and show
another
this movie
is you know
obviously I think
the height of that
it's interesting
in the labyrinth
scene
Wendy now has
her hair tied
in like pigtails
she kind of looks
more Native American
she looks more
almost like
Pocahontas
a hairstyle
and then obviously
later she's wearing
you know that
beautiful yellow jacket
with I guess it's
Navajo or Apache
like pictograph
drawings on it
you can see
she's starting to
become a little more
gentrified as she's here
and you can trace
that throughout the movie
it's a cool note
this scene where
Wendy comes in
and disturbs Jack
while he's writing
it's very funny
it's great that
you know
one of the great
moments in horror history
is all work and no play
makes Jack a dull boy
but it's very funny
that that's what
he's writing there
and she comes in
and he's like
what do you want
it's very funny
that he's
he's working
I am busy
and she is
once again
I won't keep doing this
but Shelley Duvall
is just phenomenal
in this scene
you see it play
across her face
the moment
when she realizes
you know
the person who's
supposed to be
my protector
and my safekeeper
might be a problem
and I'm locked in
here with him
it's this kind of
you know
there's so much
about marriage
and domestic abuse
in this movie
and so
she so nails
that moment
when you realize
oh this marriage
that was supposed
to be
my rock
my safekeeping
might be the thing
that kills me
and she just plays
that phenomenal
when you see it play
across her face
with no words
in this scene
she's just
incredible
and once again
the next cut
is to Thursday
and it's just
such a great device
for Kubrick to use
to suddenly speed up
the timeline
suddenly
once you see Thursday
it's like
oh shit
we're in the week
or the two weeks
or whatever
where it happens
and it's great
that Thursday
is just Jack
doing the Kubrick stare
out the window
at his wife and child
and this has been
written about to death
but uh
anyone listening
probably knows
but it's great
that the Kubrick stare
was just something
he actually did
and he obviously
later in life
needed glasses
and I guess
it was a thing
to I don't know
how eyes work
but he's obviously
a master photographer
and knows how
both the camera
and the eye work
and it's like
closing your eyes
or tilting your head down
it's like changing
the aperture almost
so you're getting
a different amount
of light into your eyes
so he would Kubrick stare
all the time
in his movies
and then of course
it's uh
you see Jack
doing it here
you see uh
Private Gomer Pyle
doing it
in Full Metal Jack
you see it
Clockwork Orange
literally opens
with Alex doing it
and it sounds like
all of them
kind of pick that up
independently
of each other
just by watching him
and just seeing
him make that
kind of dementedly
focused look
and uh
Jack might have
the best Kubrick stare
so
then obviously
we get to the
Grady twins
Danny runs into them
in the hallway
scene
and you know
one of the reasons
I love this movie
and it's just
pure movie magic
to me
is obviously
we're talking
most of this podcast
is about the world
as we talk about
the chords
and about uh
the fourth reich
in America
and it's bloodlust
and the river of blood
running under it
but Kubrick is never
one to neglect
the melody
or the plot
either
or what's happening
on screen
and this movie
is obviously
the movie
about how scary
old buildings are
and it's great
you know
personal disclosure
I just lived
in an old
scary building
in Hollywood
for the last
five years
where
there absolutely
was Hollywood
pedophilia going on
it's historical
I won't tell you
which building it was
but there's a famous
person who was a pedophile
who lived there
and uh
it was his haven
let's say
and um
there is a fucking
energy in the building
even if you're not
metaphysical or spiritual
it's just old
it's creepy
it makes weird noises
there's dark parts
that you don't know
about
in this movie
you know
the way Jaws
cleverly capitalized
on how scary
it is to swim
and not know
what's beneath you
how scary it is
to feel vulnerable
because we can't
see through the water
this movie really
capitalizes on
how scary it is
being in an old
building
and it's interesting
that the Grady twins
hallway
and uh
the hallway
where they live
in the apartment
they kind of look
shitty
they kind of look
like tacky
American culture
as opposed to
the gorgeous
stately Colorado
lounge
and the gold
champagne room
or the gold room
and the uh
the beautiful lobby
uh
the parts where
the Americans
actually had to
design it themselves
kind of look like
shit
which is a cool
note
but uh
yeah this is
the ultimate
scary old
building movie
and he's
you know
it's genius
use of
if you're
Mr. One Point
perspective
what's one way
I can make it
immediately
visually impactful
put it in a
long ass hallway
and put something
scary at the end
of the hallway
and it's great
that the
the Grady twins
shot
the way it works
the steadicam's
following Danny
around the corner
and then you
actually see the
Grady twins
out of your
periphery
just standing there
before
the camera turns
and you see them
front on
which is exactly
how the eye works
that's what's
fucking scary
is when you see
a flash
out of the corner
of your eye
and you turn
and something
big and dark
and scary
is just standing
there at the
end of a long
hallway
so Kubrick
it's very cool
to see him
be a master
of the camera
how the camera
works
you know
he was a
photographer
before he became
a film director
and was a
master photographer
and then to
know how
to use the
camera to
in relation
to your eye
and your brain
and how to
use the camera
to trick your
eye and your
brain into
feeling and
a listening
emotional reaction
and that
this movie
obviously
between the
river of blood
and the
grady twins
and the
other incredible
one point
perspective
terrifying
hallway shots
you know
really takes
a cake
so now we
get to
Monday
and there's
a bunch of
interesting stuff
going on here
I want to
start with
the first
thing
the movie
that Danny
and Wendy
are watching
it is a movie
called the
summer of 42
and in the
movie as you
can kind of
tell on screen
I guess
I don't know
about it much
I just looked
it up and
read about it
but an
older married
woman appears
to seduce this
younger boy
and obviously
in the shot
Danny's sitting
there on the
ground and
Wendy's sitting
on the couch
and some
people have
taken that
as a
suggestion
that Wendy's
a pedophile
too and that
Wendy engaged
in the abuse
of Danny
as well
I don't know
if I believe
that because
there's not
much evidence
for that elsewhere
in the movie
and I also
am just
inclined to
like Wendy
and not
want to
believe that
I think
sure
her
the mother
child
relationship
is real
and that's
one of the
few earnest
parts of this
movie
it's one of
the few
sympathetic
things that
Kubrick does
show like
why it
matters to
be a mother
and protect
your child
so he treats
her with more
care than that
but it is
interesting and
it's also
interesting to
note that
the TV has
no cable
coming out
of it
and some
people say
this was just
a mistake
on the
production
some people
say it's
hidden under
the carpet
Kubrick just
didn't want
a cable
lying out
you can also
infer that
it's an image
like The
Shining
it's this
the way
The Shining
you know
Halloran says
it's like
burnt toast
you can
sometimes
smell things
that happened
before
perhaps this
is the
TV
The Shining
through the
TV
showing an
image of
what happened
before
and maybe
the theme
is just
parental
abuse and
pedophilia
maybe it's
not
specifically
directed at
Wendy
but anyway
there's
something going
on there
and it's
interesting
and you
know
the TV
having no
cable
either way
puts us
in a world
where things
aren't quite
what they
seem
and maybe
we're seeing
an alternate
reality
maybe we're
seeing
something
that we're
not supposed
to have
seen
and that
kind of
ties into
the next
scene
when Danny
goes into
the apartment
to get his
toy
and Wendy
makes him
promise not
to wake
Jack
now if you
watch as
Danny walks
into the
apartment
look at
his sweater
obviously
Kubrick does
a ton with
Danny sweaters
in this movie
specifically this
one and the
NASA one
but if you
look at his
sweater
what it is
is a picture
of Mickey
Mouse in a
football stadium
playing football
and what it
is is a
still or
a production
image from
a Mickey
Mouse cartoon
called Touchdown
Mickey
Touchdown Mickey
was what
was playing
on the
BBC
when the
Germans
bombed
London
in World
War II
that was
what was
playing
the last
thing that
was on
TV
and went
out
when the
Germans
bombed
London
now if
you look
at the
sweatshirt
what's
interesting
is that
is not
actually a
film sell
from Touchdown
Mickey
what he is
doing in
the sweatshirt
he is punting
a ball
like football
obviously he's
kicking it
but that
that cell
that image
doesn't ever
appear in
Touchdown Mickey
the clothes
the background
everything else
is from
Touchdown Mickey
but that cell
of him
punching the
ball
and if you
look at it
it looks
like a goose
step
and there
is a whole
theme that
is again
brought full
circle of
course in
Full Metal
Jacket
in Kubrick's
work of
Nazi Mickey
Mouse
of fascist
Mickey
Mouse
of Mickey
Mouse being
the smiling
happy
neoliberal
face
saying
we care
McDonald's
cares
that
is the
cover up
for the
violence
and fascism
that undergirds
it all
and once again
a suggestion
of America
as the
fourth
reich
and a
kind of
not an
alternate
timeline
but here
in the
shining
we can
see
the true
violence
we can
see the
river
of blood
and we
can see
Nazi
Mickey
Mouse
and once
again
it's one
of these
little
hidden
notes
along with
Enos Seidel
and the
wish child
these little
notes of
Nazism
and the
Reich
surrounding
the
shining
that
once you
kind of
look into
the larger
context
and you
know who
Veit Harlan
was in the
relationship to
Kubrick
and it's
kind of
unavoidable
and inescapable
now when you
watch it
and we'll
obviously go a
lot more into
that in the
Clockwork Orange
episode
and going back
to that
plot melody
world chords
dynamic
one thing I
love is
we're talking
about all
this crazy
context and
references to
the BBC
shutting down
showing Nazi
Mickey Mouse
and this
incredible level
of detail
but then
Kubrick also
just nails
the little
human moments
like when
Danny sitting
here in the
bedroom asks
Jack
do you feel
bad
like it's
just such a
simple and
heartbreaking
moment and
then of course
Jack's
completely evil
reaction
like I said
Nicholson makes
some of the
most evil
faces on
record in
this movie
and he does
the one in
this where
it's like
the Harrison
Ford
like duck
face where
he like
flares his
nostrils
and that
turns into
the most
demented
smile as he
says and I
would never
do anything
to hurt
you
just a
cursed man
who can
make himself
look like
a fucking
Japanese
demonic
mask
just
Aku
and shit
you know
he feels
the evil
deep inside
of him
now we
get to
of course
the room
237
scene
and
the way
Danny
stands up
and says
mom
is so
fucking
heartbreaking
to me
every single
time
it sounds
so real
it sounds
so much
like how
a kid
calls for
his mom
and every
time I'm
just like
nah man
it's not
your mom
and
you notice
obviously
there's a
whole bunch
of writing
and talking
about this
scene and
what really
happens in
it
to me
I think
the reading
that makes
the most
sense is
Danny
is probably
abused and
raped by
Jack
in room
237
if you notice
of course
the thing
that leads
him there
is the
baseball
rolling up
to him
as he's
playing with
his toys
and the
baseball
leads him
to the
open room
and obviously
Jack was the
one throwing
the baseball
around
and then
if you see
when Wendy's
in the boiler
room and she
hears the
screaming of
Jack
which leads
her to
discovering
Danny
with his
sweater torn
and bruised
around his
throats
in the
background
there's a
poster for
I guess
I don't
know
the cooling
system
or a
freezer
or something
but it's
C.H. King
and then
there's a
circle with
a child's
head in it
so if you
look at it
all at once
it looks like
choking
with a
picture of
a child
to me
that's the
reading that
kind of
makes the
most sense
obviously
there's
poetic
license
with the
shining
and with
the woman
in the
bathtub
but the
way you
know the
woman's
not there
anymore
you know
you could
just read
it as a
ghost
interaction
and that's
that's kind
of the
direction
of the
original
King
book
but like
we talked
about
there's not
much
almost no
real magic
in this
movie
there's not
really ghosts
it's seeing
the past
and the future
and to me
I think
it's just to me
but to me the
reading that makes
the most sense
is it's a scene
about Jack
raping and
abusing Danny
and about pedophilia
and that was
Kubrick's way
to show it
that Jack
what appears
to be
an alluring
sexual fantasy
obviously turns
into something
horrific and
nightmarish
and
I don't know
that's one of
those scenes
that feels
like a moment
of self-reflection
for Jack
or a moment
of clarity
that the
you know
he's seeing
the shining
and then it
breaks through
you know
and he's
obviously
telling Wendy
he has the
dream about
killing her
and Danny
and chopping
them up
with an axe
at the same
time
I don't know
I think
that's the
reading that
makes most
sense
otherwise
it's kind
of this
horror
nightmare
thing that
happens
but that
would make
a lot of
sense
with Danny
and then
of course
Danny's
wearing
the
NASA
sweater
and a lot
of people
have said
you know
that's a
nod towards
Kubrick
and the
idea that
he helped
the CIA
fake the
moon landing
or he helped
at least
film maybe
a backup
version
if they
needed it
after they
had seen
his
you know
the work
and research
he was
doing
for 2001
I don't
know
if that's
true
but I
do know
that
Kubrick's
smart
and funny
and cheeky
enough
to make
a nod
towards it
which I
love
but either
way
obviously
Danny
is
has bruises
on his
neck
Wendy
at first
assumes
that Jack
did it
and accuses
him
and then
later
Jack
says
you know
the only
thing
that makes
sense
is that
Danny
must have
done it
to himself
that's
the only
logical
conclusion
and that's
obviously
a completely
illogical
conclusion
and something
happened to
Danny
and I think
you know
with the
theme
of
pedophilia
in the movie
and Jack
reading the
playgirl
about incest
and obviously
Wendy
when she's
talking to
the doctor
at the beginning
clearly covering
up something
much more
horrific
that happened
to Danny
I think
that's kind
of a safe
inference
to make
in that
it's
probably Kubrick
using poetic
license
in that scene
and then
I love
the way
Nicholson
walks away
from the
door
the way
he shoots
it
it's like
backlit
behind him
and he's
walking
you know
he's terrified
of the woman
from the
bathtub
and he's
walking away
but the way
he kind of
hunches his
body's and
shoulder
and then he
moves into
the backlight
so he's a
silhouette
he looks
like a
monster
he looks
like almost
theatrical
like a
you know
old
Frankenstein
movie
or something
kind of
doing the
hunching
walk
with the
hands
as claws
and
yeah
to me
that's always
been my
read on the
scene
and that's
what makes
the most
sense to me
and then of
course we go
golden sequences
I just
I thank God
for these
sequences
because without
them we
wouldn't have
the video
game Bioshock
and the
whole vibe
of
almost a
post-massacre
post-horror
being scored
by this kind
of pre-modern
pastoral
pop music
you know
this 1920s
and 30s
and 40s
jazzy radio
this song's
what is it
it's
Midnight
The Stars
In You
by Al
Bowley
that's
played in
the background
at the
party
and then
played again
at the
end of
the movie
Kubrick
just nailed
it on
the fucking
head
he's always
since the
end of
Strange Love
kind of
been the
king of
ironic
song usage
and obviously
him
Kubrick
and Scorsese
ushered in
the era of
no longer
using film
scores
Kubrick
soundtracked
his movies
usually with
classical music
occasionally pop
songs
and Scorsese
obviously
soundtracked
all his
own movies
too
and they
make
they kind
of make
movies with
scores now
look corny
because the
score is telling
you what to
feel and how
to feel
whereas he
just nails
this kind
of pastoral
midnight
the stars
in you
playing in
the background
of this
place where
all these
terrible
fucking
things happen
this haunted
demonic
place
but Jack
in the
scenes with
the great
Joe Turkle
as Lloyd
the bartender
just some
of the best
acting
we already
talked earlier
about Jack
and the
white man's
burden in
this scene
but he
plays it so
well as
this kind
of sniveling
like we
talked about
middle manager
he's trying
to impress
Lloyd
he's trying
to both
show Lloyd
that he's a
man of
class and
taste and
character
you know
the way he
should be
but he's also
clearly an
alcoholic who
has no money
in his wallet
and then we
obviously you
know get to
the scene with
Grady in the
bathroom
Jack really
wants to
impress them
because they
they represent
this power
structure that
he is uncovering
of the overlook
that he is
supposed to be
the steward
for and he
kind of knows
he's failing
at it or
at least
wants to
assure them
that he's
not failing
at it
and both
Joe Turkle
and the
great Philip
Stone who's
in Barry
Lyndon and
Clockwork
Orange 2
one of Kubrick's
favorite actors
they're both
just phenomenal
as these kind
of unflinching
you know
they are servants
but they're very
clearly higher up
the food chain
and the power
structure than
Jack is
they know the
they know the
overlook better
than he does
once again
one of the
great demonic
faces Nicholson
makes the
first time
he tastes
alcohol
and obviously
the original
book was a lot
about alcoholism
and I guess
Stephen King
dealing with his
own alcoholism
but I do like
that alcohol
is kind of
this the
mystical white
man's fluid
for evil
the thing that
leads him to
rape and
genocide and
kill and
pillage and
murder and
it's uh
you see it's
so well played
on Jack's face
and he
one of the
great drunk
performances by
Nicholson too
as he's trying
to convince
Lloyd
I never
touched a
hair on
this god damn
it
okay one
time
he's just
incredible in
this some of
the best acting
as Wendy and
Jack argue in
the hotel and
Danny once again
sees the river
of blood
their relationship
is just really
well written
of the white
man the
father who
thinks you
know he's
burdened with
his wife and
child and that
they're the ones
holding him back
from the glory
and status that
he should have
achieved and how
he takes it out
on them and
him saying it
isn't it's so
fucking typical of
you right when
I'm about to
really break
through with my
work and once
again we know
he's literally
just been writing
all work and
no play makes
Jack a dole
boy uh
you know both
Nicholson and
this and Kubrick
and the script
really managed to
make him both
you know venomous
and threatening
and like the
real deal bottom
line is he's
gonna try to
murder you and
you gotta get
out but he's
also weak and
pathetic and
he's also uh
has this just
completely misguided
quest for any
status some
status some he's
he's so full of
fear and so full
of insecurity and
failure that he
won't make any
deal with the
devil to be
anything even the
steward of an
empty fucking
hotel uh and
he wants he
doesn't care about
his family he
wants Lloyd and
Grady and
Stuart Ullman to
accept him and
smile when he
comes into the
bar and say hey
jack jack jack's a
great guy jack's
got a good job
uh he he plays
that so well and
he seems so petty
and weak in their
arguments and uh
you know the
the combination of
that kind of
completely unjustified
wrath and fury
directed towards
such a sweet and
vulnerable person
as Wendy who's
just trying to
keep it together
uh is is
heartbreaking and
tragic and and
really says a lot
about marriage and
the way a lot of
husbands turn their
wives into hostages
and this really ties
into obviously the
next party scene
where he meets
Delbert Grady in the
bathroom and now the
gold room is full of
people from the past
of the overlook hotel
and the elites and the
royalty and all the
best people the way
Nicholson plays it
it's so perfect it's
so it's such the
perfect white man
blend of of trying to
fit in and be of the
ilk and then also
acting like you're
better than it and
acting pompous and
not realizing you're
kind of coming off like
an ass and he plays
it incredibly and uh
the relationship the
kind of both obsequious
yet yet uh trying to
say you know keep your
face and your status
relationship he has
with Grady and Lloyd
you know he's saying
instantly saying I'm
the kind of man who
wants to know who's
buying my drinks and
then the next line be
like okay well all
right that's what you
say he's he it's
really a full fully
drawn picture by
Nicholson and Kubrick
of a powerless white
man who's deluding
himself into thinking
he is powerful and
I'm not to belabor the
point but the little
dance a little tra la
la dance as he does
as he walks away from
the bar to midnight
the stars in you and
then Grady spills the
avocado on him and
they have to go to
the bathroom uh just
the perfect dance of
the man who thinks
he's one of the fellow
royalty and doesn't
realize he's a
fucking middle manager
and a loser and uh
just the perfect little
moment just um it's
it's like the a junior
stockbroker you know
thinking he's the man
at the party and
getting way too drunk
and embarrassing
himself you know it's
a guy a guy who in
year one thinks he's
wolf of wall street
and uh it's so good
once again Kubrick and
just the comedic timing
and the sense of comedy
is so good and one of my
favorite and funniest line
reads of all time to me
is when in the bathroom
Jack realizes that Grady
is who Grady is and we
know obviously from the
story that Jack knows
Grady kills his children
and the line delivery of
Nicholson after he realizes
who Grady is and he says
um Mr. Grady
because you know exactly
what he's gonna he's
trying to broach the
topic of did you kill
your children and then
obviously this leads to
the corrected conversation
where Kubrick uh most
clearly spells out this
idea of the system of
power that the
overlook represents and
the system of power
Jack sees himself as a
steward for um it's just
such good comedic timing
very funny then obviously
Grady here tells Jack
you've always been the
caretaker and this ties
into the end and I'll get
to that more in the end
but I think that's uh I
guess a little more
metaphorical than literal
to me uh but we'll get
there at the end and then
obviously earlier when we
talked about Scatman and
Crothers this is the scene
where they refer to him by
a slur and it's really it's
really vile and kind of
shocking I don't know that
that's obviously used a
couple times in Full Metal
Jacket but it was not
really part of Kubrick's
language or uh the
language of his work uh
it's very much just a
moment to stand out to
remind you this racist
colonizer genocidal place
and to really hammer home
the idea of the white
man's burden being a
complete uh self-delusional
philosophy that justifies
being a monster on earth
and again kind of going
back to the surface level
the next scene is you know
the first uh Danny's gone
away Mrs. Torrance scene
and it's one again one of
the things I love about
this movie and the
earnestness with which it
treats Danny and Wendy
that uh it's a great movie
about how fucking scary it
is if something's wrong
with your kid and if your
kid has a disability or a
vulnerability and then
especially if you and that
kid have to live in the
same house as an abusive
father how scary it is and
just vulnerable it is to
have a kid in the first
place um and then how
much that gets hyperbolized
and magnified and and
uh exacerbated by being in
a traumatic abusive place
and uh it's a great and
very sad movie about child
abuse and child trauma and
then we get to as we talked
about for uh Halloran's epic
heroic journey across the
country to try and save Danny
and Wendy and it's great I
just noticed uh watching it
here on silent as I'm doing
this commentary that all
almost all his scenes as
he's going uh Halloran's
going left to right the way
you would as you you know
traditionally going towards
a goal so it's almost like
like the beginning of the
movie he's being sucked back
into it's a nice little
moment then we get to the
scene of uh Danny and
Wendy in the apartment and
Wendy telling him uh she's
gonna go talk to Jack while
Danny is still being Tony and
I can't believe there's
several things I never
noticed that I just noticed
now again on this is my
20th plus viewing of this
movie uh but first the scene
opens with in the background
the roadrunner theme and it
says uh roadrunner the
coyotes after you roadrunner if
he catches you you're through
which obviously is a great uh
foreshadowing of the ending and
Jack chasing Danny then I just
noticed on the couch behind
them in the room behind them
there is a Winnie the Pooh doll
once again another bear
picture associated with Danny
and then on the wall some art
scholar could do a lot better
job of this but there is
definitely a painting in their
room of two naked children I
can't tell if they're praying or
they're looking at a light or
maybe it's a waterfall but
there's absolutely two naked
children there so once again the
theme of pedophilia and child
abuse and Danny being in grave
danger from Jack uh is
constantly present and it's just
another great example of Kubrick
painting this all with the world
and not if you just focus on the
melody and the plot it's just a mom
telling Danny she's gonna go talk
to Jack and him saying okay Mrs.
Torrance but the world around it
paints a much fuller picture and
obviously then we get to all work
and no play makes Jack a dull boy
there's not much else needs to be
said but uh one Shelley Duvall's
eyes make this one of the all-time
great horror scenes her just it's just
her reacting to words on a paper and
it's one of the scariest scenes in film
history and to the I love what they
did with the shapes of the words when
the one sheet that's like triangles
something so fucking creepy about him
drawing shapes with the words and and
this incantation of this old power
uh almost mantra you know it's it's
him it's him experiencing the shining
and feeling that call to power of the
dark star in the heart of America and
it's interesting to in context of the
white man's burden that uh uh it's all
work and no play makes Jack a dull boy
like that's almost the secret mantra at
the heart of all this is like we want to
have fun we want to rape kids and
genocide the world because we want to
drive big cars and build mansions and
if it's all work and no play then life's
not worth it and we should it should just
be chaos that that's almost the real
secret of the white man's burden is I
have to keep working but I want to have
fun and you see these are people that
deny themselves nothing these are all
the best people who are their life is
just constantly them doing what they
want at the cost of everyone else around
them so all work and no play like he's
done any work like his life has required
any work up to this point uh it's a nice
kind of flip side tie-in of the the so put
upon so it posed an aggrieved idea of
the white man's burden that oh all I do
is work I never and then in his private
moment he's like I just want to play I
just want to have fun it's it's a great
reversal and once again not to belabor
the point but they're both incredible in
the scene Jack the way Nicholson says
Wendy darling light of my life and what
he does with his hand there and then
Wendy Shelly Duvall on top of the
stairs when she says don't hurt me that
gets me every fucking time it's just
once again one of these really simple
earnest moments in the script and it
just it chokes me up every time I watch
it because it's like there's no middle
ground after that there's no gray area
if someone ever tells you don't hurt me
you have to stop or else you're a bad
person like there's no and it's such an
innocent and earnest thing to say to
someone else who you know she's scared
does have the power to hurt her and
then what's great of course is she
knocks his ass out with one swing of the
bat he he is below her on the stairs he
is in a combat position at a
disadvantage she has both high ground
and a longer reach with a fucking
weapon and once again because of the
white man's burden and the insane
pompous ego that goes along with it he
thinks oh this will be easy I'm gonna
scare my wife and then kill her and kill
my kid and of course he's outsmarted and
tricked by the people who are supposed to
be weaker than him so there's a lot going
on there obviously about spousal abuse
and domestic abuse and once again
pedophilia and child abuse but also a
nice nice condemnation from Kubrick and
the script and once again just Jack
Nicholson taking this to the farthest
levels to the ugliest places of
yourself and willing to be a racist white
man's burden fucking buffoon who gets
bested and you know it's also great in
this scene once again we talk about you
know Jack went crazy but you listen to
what he's saying he's saying like have
you ever once in your life understood my
responsibilities have you ever understood
that I have a chance here and you're
fucking it up for me it's not him going
crazy it's him realizing there's a power
structure here that is bigger and larger
than familial bonds and once again much
like much like Ina Seidel and the the
book The Wish Child it said the mother
so closely entwined with the destiny of
the nation and then at the end she
sacrifices her son to it Jack is almost
sacrificing Wendy and especially Danny
to the Dark Star and to America itself
and then again this is obviously a theme
that's picked up in Eyes Wide Shut and
especially with the ending of Eyes Wide
Shut there is a suggestion that that's
perhaps what the Dark Star demands is
there's nothing higher than this there's
no greater allegiance than to the Reich and
to evil and to the idea of we are the
empire and it will never end and it will
through all the permutations of society
and history and liberalism and communism
and this and that we are the empire and
your loyalty to is to that above all else
above your family above love and if we ask
you to sacrifice your child that's the
cost to be in the club and that is you
know clearly the implication here and it's
interesting you know Jack abandons the
pursuit of Wendy when he realizes Danny's
getting away it's more important to him
that Danny be sacrificed that's that's the
blood oath so obviously there's a there's a
theme here in Kubrick's work the idea of
sacrificing your children making a blood
oath with the devil in the Dark Star and
specifically the American Reich and that
your children may be sacrificed that
combined with the bear shit the Epstein
Prince Andrew shit and then all of Eyes
Wide Shut would seem to me to suggest maybe
Kubrick got invited to some parties in the
70s and 80s and maybe he saw some things that
fucked his whole world up who knows or
maybe he heard some stories either way he's
the kind of guy you would invite to the
party he's the coolest director in the
world you know if you're Prince Andrew and
you want to go to an Eyes Wide Shut party
with all the glitterati of the world he's in
1976 or whatever Kubrick's the guy you
would call either way there's a lot going
on there and it's hinting at a whole lot
more then we get to the freezer scene and
as I said earlier you could read this as
kind of the only instance of magic that
somehow Grady the ghost of Grady the spirit
of Grady whatever Grady is unlocks the door
you could also read it as this is a
freezer in the bottom of a fucking frozen
hotel when the boiler and power have now
been shut off by or the boiler and the
and the radio and shit have been shut off
by Jack and maybe the bolt slips loose in
the middle of fucking frozen Colorado winter
who knows either way what's interesting
about the scene is obviously his conversation
with Grady and again fleshing out this idea
of the system of power and these rules that
Jack is supposed to be adhering to and is
not once again just incredible performance of
him as failing and as as Grady saying you
know she seems to have gotten the best of
you sir and it's only for the moment Mr. Grady
only for the moment it's this great picture
of this powerless white man who thinks he's
by being a servant to power by making a deal
with the devil that he will become powerful
too and instead he's you know physically
bested and outsmarted by his wife and child
and then of course we get to Halloran's death
and Halloran sacrificing himself for the
family and it's still a brutal and shocking
scene you know it's coming because of the
one-point perspective you know him walk
around saying hello is anybody there you
know it's coming and you know Jack's gonna
pop around from the pillar and kill him and
yet when he does it it's still horrible the
face he makes as the camera rises and I think
that's the first time on the soundtrack you
hear this kind of it sounds like a backwards
Gregorian chant or something it sounds like
all the elites in the eyes wide shut room doing
some demonic chant and that's the moment Jack
really unleashes the devil and makes his first kill
and I think it's important obviously that it happens
to Halloran and that's Kubrick's you know kind of
nod towards slavery and towards the sacrifice black
people had to make to survive in this country and and
them being heroic in that sacrifice but also it's a scene
that shows how brutal and horrible Jack is because up to
this point he's like he's failing most of the time and he's
kind of a joke and he's scary and the first time you see it if
you just watch on the circus level surface level it's uh scary and
creepy and he's going crazy but he hasn't accomplished anything he
hasn't done anything and how easily and terrifyingly he dispatches
Halloran I don't know it's just a reminder of the river of blood
that lies at the feet of the white American man and his white man's
burden and obviously we get to the red rum scene and I'm doing a little out of
order your Halloran dies after the scene uh but I love one thing I love about
this is you know it's Kubrick's horror movie and it takes almost two hours for
it to get into the actual horror the actual threat of being killed it's all
creepy glances and angles and creepy sounds
and then when it does go it fucking goes for the last 30 minutes
it's this two hour build up and then it unleashes insanely which you know it's
kind of symbolized by that chanting I was talking about on the soundtrack and
then this incredible alarm sounding percussion the thing that's like
it sounds like a fucking old fire alarm or something and it sounds
incredible and that's kind of scores this movie going crazy and the shining going
crazy getting to the point where you know
Wendy can even see it and you know Danny and Jack have seen it all along but now
it's pouring through the walls and the blood the river of blood is literally
rising from the bottom and they can no longer contain it this scene obviously
has been you know memed to death and it's one of the classic film scenes here's
Johnny and him breaking through the door the two things that always impact me
really in this scene is one how tragic and heartbreaking it is when she can't get
out the window and she tells her kid to just run the idea of like what it would
take for a mother to get to that moment where this you know you're supposed to
safe protect your kid their whole life they come from your womb and you're
supposed to protect them until you're too old to do so and they protect you
and the moment when the safest thing for your kid becomes just run away I don't
know where you're gonna go you just have to run that's that's the scariest
possible thing and then for that to have to do that because of your husband
because of the guy who swore to keep you safe and protect you and love you
it's just one of the more heartbreaking tragic moments where the fucking
horrible hell of domestic violence and child abuse really comes crashing through
and again I it feels bad to say this because of how hard it was for but who
better to play it than Shelley Duvall she's just she's just incredible at that
and then the here's Johnny see the other thing that always really gets me uh when you
can see on her face as he's cutting through the door uh she's always
fucking terrified and losing her mind and you know the way Kubrick and and uh
Nicholson are doing this she's having to do it over and over again
I know I'm not sure how that if they replaced the door or if they did this over
and over again or if it's this is one take or the first take or whatnot
but you can see there's a moment when the axe busts through the door when the
actual blade because it's a real axe cutting through a real door and she's
already fucking freaked out and been doing this for months and traumatized
herself there's a moment when she can see it's not when it first cuts through and
busts the hole it's when she sees the axe cut through when Shelley Duvall sees it
you can see her go from acting scared to being petrified and it's a moment it
makes it gives me I don't say this shit lightly I'm not I wouldn't say this it
literally gives me goosebumps like it literally gives me a cold shiver down my
spine it's like seeing a moment it's like seeing a deer terrified in the
headlights right before it gets killed I feel like I'm seeing a moment I'm not
supposed to see you see it in her eyes when the blade comes through she goes
from I'm watching it right now she goes from acting she's crying and sobbing and
then she sees the axe and it becomes this blood curdling her eyes go wide and it
gets me every time it's it feels like a moment we're not supposed to see because
I think it was real another scene obviously that kills me every time is Danny
hides in the cupboard in the hallway and it's such this tragic moment it's like oh
no buddy that's not good enough that's that's so where a little kid would think
like maybe he won't look in here it's like no man that's not gonna that's not gonna cut
it but then the triumphant moment with Danny figures out how to cover his up
his tracks in the snow and obviously outsmarts Jack and leads him to his death
I don't know that I've ever cheered for a character in a movie harder then I'm
like come on Danny come on you can do it like it is uh it's really well done really
obviously just really uh cleverly spaced and choreographed action and then of
course once again we see uh Danny come out of the cabinet and get chased and once again it's just a
great use of Kubrick knowing how the eye works to shoot that over Jack's shoulder stop the camera
with him and then start it lurching forward again uh to shoot it from the monster's perspective instead
of the the victim running away is just terrifying and great and then we get to the whole last sequence
where Wendy's going around trying to find Danny and trying to stop Jack but being bombarded by the
shining and we get to of course the infamous bear scene and I think we've already said you know
what I can say about that but uh just to reiterate I think it's a clear nod towards elite pedophilia I
think that that's one of those scenes that people are like what the hell was going on with the bear he
was blowing a guy you always hear like oh that's just Kubrick being weird and esoteric and uh
surrealistic and by people who don't know what the word surreal means uh in reality I think there's
obviously what we already talked about it's it's a symbol of royal and elite pedophilia that this place
has come to represent and uh kind of the only way Kubrick could deal with that issue was in symbolism
and was in uh metaphor obviously especially in 1980 in a big budget Hollywood uh horror movie he had to
figure out a way to work it in I think that's clearly what he does there and uh it remains
horrifying and terrifying the zoom in and the fact that the bear is like fucked up snaggle teeth
it's it's it's terrible but uh I think it's a complete I mean we can we're gonna get a lot more
into this and eyes wide shut but a complete misreading by his fans and by just kind of the
American media and then culture in general you know when people see this Epstein shit it's it's
it's written about as well what a weird and crazy guy what a fucked up guy and not maybe he was part
of something bigger maybe this is a system that's been around for a long time maybe I mean since the
days of Caligula and the days of feudal samurai you know nobility has bonded over pedophilia it's been a
a blood oath bond that they tie their secrets off with and that's clearly cool and he's this is why
one of the reasons I go back to these movies and especially once Epstein died went back and kind of
went crazy about eyes wide shut because it's like he was trying to fucking tell us he's the only
person in our culture I mean Queen my brother showed me a song Queen has a song called Khashoggi's Ship
about sailing on the ship that became Epstein's yacht and just of course fucking 13 year old boys
on that ship I mean of course that's what was happening this has been going on for a long long
time and all the best people have been doing it and uh the bear that's one of the reasons I want to do
this series and these things because you know the bear blowing the guy in a tuxedo is just this
image that oh it's crazy it's some weird surreal ghost haunting shit some some fucked up shit
happened at the Overlook Hotel and I don't think people are understanding what Kubrick is saying
that this has been an essential part of at least American and and a larger western culture and an
essential part of enlightenment culture and we're all living in the dark and we're pretending that it's
not real we are all living with eyes wide shut once again we get to the last iteration of the river
of blood and now Wendy can see it too and uh I don't really have much more to say about the shot I
just love it and want to see it as many times as I can because to me it's this again a moment that's
become a meme and is misunderstood and is this essential moment of kind of the essential snapshot
of America that's why I said if I could choose one poster I'd put the river of blood on it
and so now we get to the end Danny outsmarts Jack Jack gets frozen in his terrible labyrinth
screaming out cursedly for Danny the way he says Danny I'm coming like it's something Danny wants or
expects and not a you know the most horrific imposition a person can do to another person
uh it's it's terrible it's like Danny knows he's supposed to be part of the blood ritual and they're
playing a little game but in their little game Danny outsmarts him Jack freezes to death in the
labyrinth Wendy and Danny drive away in the snowcat as the uh as it goes over the hill the fog rolls
over one of the most on the nose and kind of uh specific movie magic moments of Kubrick again one of
the few earnest and sympathetic moments in Kubrick's career he gives Wendy and Danny this kind of movie
magic escape they get in the car and drive away and the smoke covers their escape and Jack's left
to freeze there which I'm happy for we needed some something good to happen in this movie
and then of course we get to the end midnight the stars in you comes back and we see the slow zoom in
on Jack at the July 4th 1921 overlook party and again I talked about it in the Grady bathroom scene I
take it more metaphorically a lot of people focus a lot of time and energy on the great mystery of the
ending of the shining and I took it more again with this understanding of the shining is the ability
to see the past and present you know not that Jack is 120 years old or he's an ageless vampire and that
he was literally there more that this cycle once again we're born in violence and we will end in
violence this is where it comes from and this is where it goes and the fact that presumably Jack
before then Grady then Jack again end up at the same place of having to correct their children and
having to sacrifice their children and their families and their wives and just any any love any human part
sacrifice it to the dark star underneath the overlook you know I think it's just more a suggestion that this
is the real system of power once again as let's go back to the original Kubrick quote of uh let me find
it I'm interested in the brutal and violent nature of man because it's a true picture of him that this is
the penultimate characteristic of man this is how he marks his place among the stars and how he
what makes him man and what delineates him from the other apes and starts and ends his journey of
evolution and so I take it more metaphorically that Jack's always been there he's always been
the caretaker and he always will be it'll always be a weak stupid white man who thinks the white man's
burden is his manifest destiny and that's why he gets to have the life he does and that's why he gets
to eat garlic naan crackers at his local Trader Joe's while people starve and suffer around the world
and I think it's really vital to note that the you know the shining does end on a note of hope
Wendy and Danny get away the thing that you've you know it's been horrifically previewing the whole
movie that's been pulling you in towards the tractor beam from frame one does not happen you know you
can read his work in this context I'm talking about is deeply pessimistic and you could uh
read him as a misanthrope or someone who hated humanity or the universe I don't think that's
that's true or right at all I think you know he did view man as defined by violence but didn't see
that as a hopeless condemnation but more that it's uh it's dishonest and inaccurate to kind of
write our own history without acknowledging that it's has always and will always be shaped by violence
and you can kind of read his last seven movies almost as not an alternate history but um it's
presented you know as artistically and entertainingly as possible through his talents as uh a testament to
a history of someone who does see the river of blood and who will acknowledge it and you know who said
you know systems uh institutions that are not willing to acknowledge that this are doomed to failure
um but it is a note of hope and optimism that it ends on he does show Danny and Wendy thankfully
some mercy and again ties back into two of the only characters he has empathy for or uh treats in earnest
but outside of that I think you have to view the shining within this context as uh a picture of America
as the fourth reich as we've talked about and I use that term loosely don't get caught up on the
specifics although there is you know this is the man who made Dr. Strangelove the movie about the
paperclip ex-nazi the one that gave us the cultural meme about nazis hiding right in our midst there is a
lot about nazis and specifically the reich and you know we talked about Ina Seidel and the 88 authors who
vowed loyalty to hitler and uh that whole influence but I'm using that term more loosely as this idea of
fascism existing underneath liberalism and and you know America really gained its moral authority by
winning world war ii and defeating the bad guys and you know both Kubrick and Thomas Pynchon and others
have kind of said you know if we implement the same practices and policies and we employ the same
companies and use them and we use the same tactics to gather information and spy on people and kill people
across the globe and we literally employ some of the same people that did it and we hide them and we
make sure they get away with it and are never prosecuted then what's the difference so obviously
that's you know fascism as the politics of violence is is uh is this long arc throughout his work and
the shining is kind of like I said the dark star apotheosis of this evil and America is the embodiment of
this evil that America's everyone else tried it America's the one getting away with it and I think
that's why he left America and he never came back and his movie about America is The Shining atop the
river of blood uh we will get more into that next time thank you for your time and for paying attention
