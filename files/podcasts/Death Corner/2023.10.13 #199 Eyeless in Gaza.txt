Let I club you all
For you all
We are fighting human animals.
And we act accordingly.
We are fighting human animals.
And we act accordingly.
We are fighting human animals.
And we act accordingly.
We are fighting human animals.
And we act accordingly.
These are the words of a minister of defense in an American ally nation that has received hundreds of billions of dollars in what we euphemistically call military aid.

We have been expecting you.
If there were ever an event to prove that the Nazis were not defeated.
We were not trying to defeat them.
We were trying to repurpose them.
If there were ever an event to prove that fascism was not conquered.
We never wanted to conquer fascism.
Fascism simply was absorbed into the capitalist American European bloc as another tool in the arsenal.
When all that liberal democracy shit was wearing a little bit thin in terms of our actual objectives.
If anything proves that, this proves that.
The last, God, how long has it even been?
Four days?
Five days?
Six days?
Six days?
I've been awake for most of it.
You're going to notice that I'm talking a little bit more hesitantly tonight.
Because this is not easy to talk about.
But one of the things that immediately comes to mind is I don't ever want to hear anyone.
And I mean anyone who is alive and cogent right now.
Anyone who is adult enough to understand what's happening right now.
Ever look back at any other point, place, time in history.
And say, how could they let that happen?
How was it possible?
How could an entire people be slaughtered?
How did the international community stand by and do nothing?
Surely we have safeguards in place.
Surely.
Surely there are elements of the system built in to prevent this kind of thing from happening.
No.
You know how it happens now.
And to an extent that is perhaps historically unprecedented, it doesn't just happen.
It happens in front of your eyes.
We know much more about what's going on in Gaza right now than we have known about.
And we, I mean the general public, than we have known about the majority of genocides in human history.
We've got more footage.
We've got more audio.
We are as aware as we could reasonably be of what's happening there.
And it's still happening.
The awareness isn't doing anything.
The fucking insanity that you feel sitting here watching it and then hearing it described back to you as something completely different.
That cognitive dissonance that we, as I'm guessing, listenership wise, primarily citizens of what are called Western capitalist liberal democracies.
The idea that when we see something and say, wait, that's not true.
Wait, that doesn't make any sense.
Wait, that's not what I heard.
The idea that that does something, that that necessarily in itself is an effective act.
I hope you can really, really put that behind you now.
Because that is not how shit works.
It never has been.
It was a lie to begin with.
It was a very effective lie designed to keep you from doing anything else.
Imagine, imagine a week ago, I thought, oh, I'm going to do a Q&A.
That'll be fun.
I get to think about something outside my own head.
And people are way more responsive to it than I thought they would be.
I guess they actually want me to.
And I thought I was going to do that.
But I would feel like, I believe the term is a fucking asshole talking about anything other than this right now.
I can't think about anything other than this right now.
And I used that word genocide earlier advisedly.
That was not haphazard diction.
I meant exactly what I said.
And in furtherance of describing what I meant, to start with this, I just want to do something I don't normally do.
And just read you a short series of pieces of information.
Or call to mind a series of things that have been written, things that have been said, as sort of splinters that I hope I will be able to constellate into something meaningful by the end of this.
God knows if the constellation of meaning is within my power right now.
But I'm going to try.
So bear with me here.
The first of these shards is a line from a poem that I've been thinking of, I would say, about 50 times a day, every day.
A poem by a guy whose name is normally pronounced Paul Celan, or Celan, C-E-L-A-N, because he spent much of his writing life in France.
But actually, given his backstory, it should probably be Celan.
But anyway, people call him Celan.
Let's go with that for now.
Celan was born in, I believe, 1920, in a contested region in Eastern Europe called the Bukovina, which I believe is now in Ukraine.
And at the time was part of Romania and was Jewish.
And if you're thinking that 1920 is a bad time to be born Jewish in the Ukraine-Romania region, you're right.
His entire family was sent to the death camps.
By pure blind luck, he wasn't home when the Einsatzgruppe came for his family, which tortured him for the rest of his life until he killed himself.
And he was put in Nazi war camps.
Eventually managed to survive against every kind of odds, but was so haunted by this for the rest of his life, his abbreviated life, that it essentially drove him insane.
And he, in his last days, became convinced that he had a choice.
He either had to kill his own son, as Abraham was willing to kill Isaac, to renew God's covenant with the Jewish people.
Because clearly, if the Holocaust had happened, God had broken that covenant, and it had to be renewed.
So he either had to kill his own son or commit suicide.
And he chose the latter.
He jumped off a bridge in Paris.
And bear in mind, as I say this, for the demographic group that Salon was part of, this is a good outcome.
This is the story of someone who made it.
This is, relatively speaking, a success story.
Of someone who lived through a genocide.
And I want you to think about that.
Living through a genocide.
Even if you don't die.
What happens to you?
What happens to your mind?
What happens to your sense of the world?
And Salon was particularly horrified and made to feel fucking insane.
By the fact that Nazi officials, he knew very well.
Sometimes people he had personally, let's say, interacted with.
Were rapidly stalking the government of the new West Germany.
That, in fact, Nazism wasn't over.
That it was actually never supposed to end.
That it was going on in a different guise.
This time to be operated by the Western Bloc against the Soviet states.
And he, of course, was told that this was insane paranoia.
And yes, it's very sad what happened to you.
I know you went through something deeply traumatic.
But you can't live your life in these grim fantasies anymore, Paul.
And Paul Salon wrote a line that, though it's not specific to this in the poem.
Because Salon was a very allusive writer.
He hated the word hermetic.
But I think it's actually a good one for him.
He wasn't the type to explicitly lay out a context for something.
But he wrote a line that I have always thought must have been the result of the post-war trials of the Nazis.
Of being aware of the trials of the Nazis and how they were progressing.
And he, having been in a Nazi camp, wrote in German,
Wer zeugt für den Zeugen?
Wer zeugt für den Zeugen?
That is, in English,
Who bears witness for the witness?
Or who testifies to the witness?
Because Salon had this terrible realization that he and the people who were there,
the few survivors,
they could say what they saw, right?
They could tell the world.
They could record it in the most minute detail possible.
But, on the one hand,
the people who could actually speak to the Holocaust in full were all dead.
They were not capable of bearing witness.
The thing they endured rendered them unable to bear witness.
And on the other side,
if all the people like him who somehow managed to live through it
described exactly what happened in the most fulsome depth they could manage,
but no one else took their side and testified to it.
No one else was willing to say,
yes, we believe this.
Yes, we take you seriously.
Then it didn't matter.
And you can imagine the mindset of a man who is terrified about this.
The idea that the first-hand experience of survivors of genocide
might tell the world and have the world be indifferent
or outright disbelieve them
when that same man sees fucking Nazis
reconstituting Germany
as now a Western-friendly state
ready to take on the 20th century challenge of Soviet aggression.
You can imagine
what that set off in his mind.
And that is something that
I haven't just been thinking about
in an obsessive way,
although, I mean, that's also true.
But I have been thinking about in a very active way
that I try rarely to tell anyone to do anything on here,
but that I would like you to think about
as this all goes on,
because there's no reason to assume this is stopping.
I don't think it will.
I have real fucking dire prognostications
for where this is headed.
But every fucking day, at least once,
wer zeugt für den Zeugen.
Yes, there are the first-hand witnesses.
Who are the witnesses for them?
Who are the people
who are going to stand up
next to, alongside,
them,
and say,
yes, it's true.
Yes, we believe you.
Yes, we know.
Yes, we have proof.
Yes,
against every imperative
our fucking culture and government offered us,
we did not stop paying attention.
We kept looking.
It hurt
like very few other things
have ever hurt.
But we had to keep looking
because we knew,
eventually,
the witnesses were going to need witnesses.
This I am thinking about often.
That's the first thing.
The second thing
is the title of this episode,
a phrase that has
obsessed me for years.
I listen, Gaza.
It comes from a horrible,
long poem
by the horrible writer,
John Milton,
called Samson Agonistes.
His retelling of the,
you know,
Samson narrative
from the Old Testament,
which you can imagine
what the guy who wrote
Paradise Lost
did with that.
What a fucking asshole.
But he uses that phrase
to describe Samson
near the end of the poem.
I listen, Gaza.
And that phrase
was then taken up
by another
asshole and terrible writer,
Aldous Huxley,
for a
novel
about Samson.
I think in
1948 or so.
Who the fuck
is writing a novel
about Samson
in 1948?
Jesus Christ.
But that title,
I Listen, Gaza,
every time I was
at a bookstore,
every time I was
looking for something else,
whenever I saw that
on the spine of a book,
that would just
freeze me.
Because,
first of all,
just as a piece
of language
that has
just
stuck in the
side of my head
like a dart
for probably,
I don't know,
15 years now.
But also because
of
the enormous
shift
in a connotation
of what
Gaza means
versus the
time that any
of those
prior books
were written.
When Milton wrote
Samson Agonistes,
he didn't know
anything about
fucking Gaza.
He didn't have
the least clue.
I don't know
if the guy ever
left England
in his entire life.
And we're talking
about the 1610s,
1620s here.
The word
Gaza to him
was simply
what the French
like to call
a trouvet,
a good find,
a nice catch.
Like, ooh,
Gaza.
You know the name
of some geography
in the Holy Land.
See, that makes it sound,
you know,
that gives it
a certain authenticity,
a certain ring,
as you know,
hard-won experience.
I'm sure he just
picked it out
of a Bible verse
off a map.
It didn't mean
shit to him,
right?
I'm sure there are,
you know,
I haven't read
all of Samson Agonistes
because why would
a human being
submit him
or herself to that?
But there were
probably 20
other place names
from the Middle East
as it was
denominated
in 1616
or whatever
in that poem
as well.
None of them
meant anything
specific to
John Milton.
He just saw
that one somewhere
and thought,
hmm,
that sounds good.
That sounds good.
And I don't want
to say to his credit
because I don't want
to give him any credit,
but it does sound good.
It's good sounding.
That's part of the reason
it stuck with me.
The other reason,
though,
as I say,
is the fact that
the word in that title
which meant
the least to him
and the least to anyone
who would have been
reading or thinking
of that poem
when it was written
now means the most.
it's impossible
to say Gaza
in any kind
of modern context
without this massive
weight of connotation
as well it fucking
should be.
And it's not just
that Gaza has
a great deal
of meaning
in an indifferent sense,
right?
Los Angeles
has a great deal
of meaning.
New York
has a great deal.
Fucking St. Louis
has a great deal
of meaning
if you care enough
to know.
It's that Gaza
is something
with a great deal
of meaning
that we try
not to know about.
That our entire culture
has been geared
for decades
to not knowing about,
to not paying attention to,
to being able
to read or hear
that word
and just immediately
throw up our hands
and go,
ooh,
buddy,
all that Israel-Palestine shit,
you're not going
to get me involved
in that.
Look,
I just,
you know,
people got to do
what they got to do
and I just,
I just hope things
settle down there.
You know,
it's really playing havoc
with the markets
right now.
I mean,
have you looked
at the currency markets
lately?
My stocks
are all over
the fucking place.
I just,
you know,
whatever,
whatever calms
the situation down,
by which people
usually mean,
not whatever provides
any kind of equitable
or just settlement,
but whatever finally
kills enough people
on the wrong side,
that the international community,
as it likes to call itself,
though it is not a community
and is in many respects
not international at all,
that that community
can just stop fucking
thinking about it.
This is what the Westerner
wants from Gaza,
to stop thinking about it.
And it is in that sense
and in another sense
that Eilis,
the Eilis in Gaza,
has always hit me
right in the chest
because Gaza,
as some of you
are probably well aware,
is very likely
the most surveilled
place on Earth.
Now,
you can talk about
the surveillance regime
in England,
you can talk about
the surveillance set up
in places like
Washington, D.C.,
but those are,
that is surveillance
built by the political authority
governing that territory.
That is surveillance
in service
of the government
governing that territory,
right?
Usually not in service
of the citizens,
but the government
did that to itself.
It had that imposed
upon itself
willingly
because it wanted it.
Not so in Gaza.
No one in Gaza
ever got any fucking choice
about surveillance.
But these are people
who have military plane
flyovers
every single day.
Aerial photographs
in great detail
every single day
who are monitored
in terms of
where they go,
who they talk to,
surveillance cameras
everywhere,
hidden mics
everywhere,
snitches,
double agents,
people who are
ostensibly Palestinians
living in Gaza
who actually work
for Mossad
or Shin Bet
or the IDF.
These are people
who essentially
cannot do anything
in their lives
without it being
seen,
heard,
and logged
by the Israeli state.
There has probably
never been
a more seen,
more heard
population
in the history
of the world.
And these people
who are more
seen and heard
than anyone else
who has ever lived
are also
the least looked at
and the least listened to.
We have
every possible
fucking resource.
And when I say we,
yeah,
I'm including America,
I'm including Canada,
I'm including the UK,
I'm including everyone
on this side
because the actions
of what is now
the openly fascist
Israeli state
would not be possible
without the support
of the Western bloc.
Let's not fucking kid ourselves.
This is not just
an Israeli problem.
This is not,
as the fucking
Saudi bots
on Twitter
love to say,
anytime you mention
a Saudi war crime,
this is not,
and I quote,
an internal matter.
No, no, no, no, no.
This is much
fucking bigger than that.
We have every
conceivable resource
to know
in every conceivable
depth
about what is going
on in Gaza
and yet
most of us,
most of us,
most of the people
in the world
don't know shit
and never will.
They are eyeless
from the outside.
Plenty to see.
Very, very plausible
to see it.
But eyeless
from the outside
and from the inside,
the Gazans themselves,
the Palestinians
in Gaza,
we have effectively
rendered them
eyeless as well
and earless
and mouthless
because
no testimony
gets to come
out of Gaza.
Not in an effective sense.
Sure,
you will hear people,
you know,
giving narrative
descriptions
every once in a while.
You'll hear about
some fucking
Western journalist
going there to,
God,
I can't remember
who said this.
it was a Palestinian
who said,
you come to the
four cafes
and sit on the beach
at night
and write about
how Gaza
is troubled
but vibrant.
We all know
about that shit.
No,
I'm talking about
real testimony,
real witness.
They're not allowed
to talk.
They are in the category
of the silent subaltern
to the entire rest
of the fucking world
which includes
so often
so many
of the other
Muslim or Arabic nations
that claim to be
theoretically in favor
of,
you know,
Palestinian right
to land and return
and to have homes
and not to be subjected
to the Israeli state
who then,
well,
we really want to
strike this trade deal
with Israel though
or we really don't want
the American military
on our ass.
We really don't want
when the next axis
of evil speech is made,
we don't want
our name in there
because we know
what happened
to the countries
from the last axis
of evil speech
and unlike North Korea,
we don't have
a nuclear bomb.
So,
yeah,
sorry about you.
I feel really bad.
You know,
it's,
I'm on your side
in my heart.
Does that make you
feel any better?
I'm not going to do
anything to help.
In fact,
actually,
I'm going to directly
work with the people
who are genociding you.
But,
but I want you to know
that deep down
I was with you
the whole time.
You know,
when you look back
on the beach
and you only see
one set of footprints,
well,
actually,
that's because
you were completely alone.
But I wish
I was there.
This is the attitude
of even
the more enlightened
people
outside of Gaza.
The people
who are actually
from there,
the people
who know
very well
what they see
and hear
and think
and feel
and experience
every day,
they have essentially
no voice.
and if anyone
is even
willing to
reprint
their statements
or to make
public
their audio,
it will be
either a
little coterie
publication
that largely
exists
so people
can feel
self-satisfied
about how
noble
and humanitarian
and globally
minded they are,
or it will be
in the course
of a denunciation
by the state
of Israel
that will then
be reported
as fact.
I hope
you've been
noticing that
this last week,
how
anyone in
Palestine
says something.
It is responded
to
by Israel
and then
the Western
press
reports the
story
using the
Israeli
statement
as a fact
and just
mentioning
that it was
contested
by the
Palestinian one,
often not
even reprinting
the Palestinian
one.
You don't
hear,
he said
this,
he said
that.
You hear,
Israel has
issued a
statement today
saying that
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
This was
a response
to a
Palestinian
accusation
of brutality.
Some shit
along those
lines,
often not
even that.
We have
ripped these
people's eyes
and tongues
out.
We have
foreshortened
the horizons
of human
existence
for them
more than
I really
thought was
possible
at this
point in
history.
We have
taken away
the rudiments
of basic
civilization
from them,
but we have
given them
an extra
dose of
the paranoia
that comes
with
civilization.
In fact,
more paranoia
and more
justified
paranoia
perhaps than
anyone else
in the history
of the
goddamn
world.
Because they
also know,
the people
in Gaza,
they know
what's happening
to them,
could be seen,
could be heard,
that someone
could do
something about
this,
that this is
not a
fucking secret.
These are
not war
plans hidden
away in the
fucking
Führer
bunker.
This is
on film,
on tape,
every day,
every day
for years,
every day
for fucking
decades.
They know
that anyone
who wants
to know
about this
can know
about this,
and almost
no one
chooses to.
Israel has,
as far as I
can tell,
completely
given up
on the
strategy
of trying
to hide
any of this
from the
world.
Of course,
they still
issue
blanket
denial
lies about
virtually
everything,
but I
think that's
more a
function of
employment
than Israeli
statehood.
There are a
lot of
people whose
jobs consist
of issuing
those blanket
denials,
and we don't
want to put
them out of
work,
do we?
I don't
think Israel
gives a
fuck what
people see
in Gaza
anymore.
I think
they have
concluded that
it doesn't
matter.
And I
think this
Hamas
attack is
a conclusion
in much
the same
direction.
And look,
I am not
happy about
anybody dying,
Jesus Christ,
ever.
That is not
how it works.
And I am,
as a personal
matter,
I am
myself pretty
much an
absolute
pacifist,
but I do
not think
for a
fucking
splinter
of an
instant
that my
personal
convictions
as to
how I
want to
behave have
anything to
do with
what is
just and
rightful and
decent and
sane for
people who
live in a
concentration
camp.
That is not
mine to
say,
and I would
hope you
would know
and bear in
mind that it
is not
yours either.
The last
thing anyone
on earth
needs now,
the last
fucking thing,
is any
opinion from
anyone outside
of Gaza
about the
legitimacy of
Hamas.
Are you
fucking kidding
me?
Is this
really something
you think we
should be
talking about?
And while
we're on the
subject,
the word,
I am certain
that people
will die,
probably have
already died,
simply from
Western
laziness in
language and
ignorance in
politics of
the fact
that Hamas
is not
the 1,500
or so
guys who
apparently
conducted this
attack on
Israel.
1,500 is
the last
number I
heard.
I don't
know what
the estimate
is now.
That's not
Hamas in
itself.
Hamas is the
government of
Gaza.
To the extent
that it has
any political
representation at
all, Hamas
is that
government.
So,
asking
Palestinians
wherever they
are, whenever
they have a
chance to speak,
because if
they ever
get to speak
at all, you
know exactly
how.
They get to
speak by
answering the
question, do
you denounce
Hamas?
Do you
categorically
denounce
Hamas for
having conducted
these outrageous
attacks?
That's when
they're allowed
to talk.
That's the
only moment.
Hamas is not
just the people
who committed
the attacks.
Hamas, to the
extent that these
people have any
government, is
that government.
I want you to
think of that.
I'm going to
put it in
American terms,
just because
these are the
ones I'm most
familiar with.
Imagine if
you were
required as
an American
to denounce
everything about
the American
government,
right?
And I know
some of you
out there are
thinking,
hell yeah,
absolutely I
would.
You would
denounce a lot
of it.
You would
denounce the
politicians.
But imagine
that denunciation
required denouncing
all the people
who build
roads,
denouncing
the post
office,
denouncing
the electrical
grid.
Are you ready
to do that?
Can you see
from that how
fucking strange
it must feel
for a Gazan
to be asked,
do you
denounce
Hamas?
The whole
government?
The only
government that
I have other
than you?
That's fucking
crazy.
And consider
now that
we are
demanding
denunciations
of this
government
from a
country,
if you're
in America,
that,
well,
I've been
calling it
the Fourth
Reich for
a long
time now,
I think
you know
enough
reasons why.
A country
whose intelligence
service has
probably,
if you could
really get
the numbers,
murdered more
human beings
than any
other entity
in the
history of
the earth.
a country
that is
currently
providing
arms and
training to
Nazis in
Eastern Europe,
not just
with the
expectation
that,
but with
the enthusiastic
hope that
those arms,
that training
will proliferate
to other
Nazi groups,
which can be
used in the
strategy of
tension we
have been
employing all
over the
world since
the end of
World War II
and the NATO
CIA creation
of the
Gladio groups.
we're demanding
these people
denounce their
government.
If you're in
Canada,
you're in a
country where
a Waffen-SS
war criminal
just got a
standing ovation
in Parliament
and where
the deputy
prime minister
and I'm
guessing woman
who invited
that guy
Jaroslav
Hunka,
of course he
has to have
a stupid
fucking name,
Hunka,
the deputy
prime minister
is the
granddaughter
of a man
she has
repeatedly
cited as
her
inspiration
and hero
a guy
who worked
was run
by Nazi
military
intelligence
during the
war and
his job
was taking
over a
couple of
newspapers
that had
been stolen
from their
Jewish owners
who were sent
to death
camps and
turning those
newspapers
into Nazi
propaganda
rags,
publishing
pieces like
and this is
not one I'm
making up,
this is one
I've actually
seen,
it's called
how to spot
your local
Jew
and you're
demanding a
denunciation,
you have
that right,
we have now,
and this is
something that I
feel like people
haven't even
noticed over the
last week,
week and a half
or so because,
well,
there are obvious
reasons but also
because the
implications of it
are too fucking
crazy to think
about,
Ukraine now
has special
forces,
which is to
say people
very likely
trained and
or armed by
the US and
its allies
in fucking
Sudan because
the Wagner
group has
paramilitaries
in Sudan and
Ukraine now
asserts the
right to
murder anyone
it considers a
Russian fighter
anywhere on
earth.
can you
imagine claiming
that prerogative
that we,
this one
nation,
we get to
decide from
the entirety
of the human
race what
constitutes a
Russian fighter
and then no
matter where
that person
is,
no matter
the local
government,
no matter
the local
laws,
we get to
fly in and
murder that
person and
you can't say
anything about
it.
They get to
demand a
denunciation,
do they?
Is that how
it works?
asking for a
political
denunciation from
the victims of
a genocide
during the
genocide.
Now, I
have to
admit, I'm
not surprised
by much at
this point,
but that
fucking surprised
me.
The fact,
they're not
even waiting
until it's
over.
It is
happening
right now
and as
people are
trying to
escape what
is essentially
a free
fire zone,
the first
thing they're
being asked
is, well,
you got to
say your
government's
bad.
Jesus
fucking
Christ.
This is,
I can't
decide which
half of it
is more
horrifying.
The half
of it that
consists of
actively
murdering
these people,
fully knowing
what you're
doing,
or the
half of it,
the western
half in large
part,
part of the
western public
at least,
which consists
in being
so fucking
lazy,
so fucking
incurious,
so utterly
uninterested
in what
happens to
any other
human being
that you
would take
it as
your
prerogative
to demand
a pro
forma
political
denunciation
in order
for someone
to get
out of
hell.
Jesus
fucking
Christ.
That
threw me
in a way
I haven't
been thrown
for a while.
This whole
week has
thrown me
in a way
I haven't
been thrown
for a while.
But,
as I said
at the
beginning,
shards,
splinters,
that was
number two.
And I'm
going to
tell you
number three,
and you
will notice
that I
have used
the word
genocide
on multiple
occasions
through this
show,
and you may
have been
wondering about
that.
You may
have been
thinking,
is that
really right?
I mean,
I know it's
bad,
but genocide,
I mean,
that's not a
word to
throw around.
Well,
I've talked
about this
before,
but I don't
know if anyone
remembers it,
so I'm going
to talk about
it in more
detail again.
Genocide does
not mean what
most people
think it
means.
Genocide does
not mean
strictly full
extermination of
a people who
are grouped by
ethnic background,
religion,
whatever.
That's the
end of a
genocide,
right?
That's the
last part.
The entire
reason for
coming up
with a
legally defined
concept of
genocide is
so the
genocide could
be identified
and hopefully
stopped before
the last part,
before the
extermination.
What is the
point of
waiting until
the extermination
is over to
do anything?
And equally,
right now for
the Israelis,
what is the
point of
getting done
for half a
genocide versus
a full one?
what's their
incentive to
stop?
I don't see
the West
giving them
any incentive
to stop.
I don't
frankly see
anyone providing
them with any
reason that is
in the odious
self-interest of
a just an
abysmal,
abominable excuse
for a human
being like
Philly Ben
Netanyahu,
like Yoav
Gallant,
like Naftali
Bennett.
God, Jesus,
what a piece
of shit.
Why would
they care if
there ever
actually going
to be any
consequences,
whether they're
being charged
with, you
know, two
thirds of a
genocide or a
complete one?
What constitutes
a complete one
anyway?
They know
perfectly well
that the odds
are there will
never be any
kind of consequences
for this on
any level,
that if anything,
they may be
hailed as heroes.
But on the
off chance,
on the
minuscule
probability
that anything
actually happened
to them,
at this point,
I imagine
they're thinking,
what the fuck?
Who cares?
We're already
doing it.
We're going to
stop because
we think
we will be
somehow less
criminal
if we're
ever actually
indicted for
any of this.
It's too
fucking late
for that.
So go whole
hog.
Hey,
generationally,
this may be
your last
opportunity.
This is why
I bring up
the word
genocide.
Because I
want to read
you something
by the
man who
popularized
the entire
concept of
genocide,
the man who
worked to
get it
into the
legal lexicon,
to make it a
piece of
international
legal terminology,
and to get
the UN to
adopt its
convention on
genocide,
for whatever
the fuck
that's worth,
was a
lawyer named
Raphael
Limbkin.
And this is
Raphael
Limbkin speaking,
I believe,
in the early
days of this
concept,
before he had
actually gotten
the UN to
recognize it.
And he wrote,
generally speaking,
genocide does
not necessarily
mean the
immediate
destruction of
a nation,
except when
accomplished by
mass killings
of all members
of a nation.
And let me
point out here
that when he
says nation,
he's not
talking about
a nation
state in
the modern
political sense.
He means
nation as
in the
literal older
sense,
people of
the same
birth,
what we
would probably
call an
ethnic group.
That's what
the word
nation means in
this context.
So let me
restart with
that in
mind.
Generally
speaking,
genocide does
not necessarily
mean the
immediate
destruction of
a nation,
except when
accomplished by
mass killings
of all members
of a nation.
It is
intended,
rather,
to signify a
coordinated plan
of different
actions aiming
at the
destruction of
essential
foundations of
the life of
national groups,
with the aim
of annihilating
the groups
themselves.
The objectives
of such a
plan would
be disintegration
of the
political and
social institutions,
of the
culture,
language,
national feelings,
religion,
and economic
existence of
national groups,
and the
destruction of
the personal
security,
liberty,
health,
dignity,
and even
the lives
of the
individuals
belonging to
such groups.
Let's say
that again,
and think of
Gaza during
this.

and even

Now,
this is from
the man who
coined the
term.
This is from
the man
who managed
to take
genocide from
a concept
to an
actual part
of the
juridical
lexicon.
However,
ineffective and
usually less
than ineffective
people like the
UN and
International
Criminal Court
have been
in actually
prosecuting it.
If you ever
take a look at
the International
Criminal Court,
you'll notice
that they sure
love putting
Africans in jail.
They don't tend
to do much
about Americans
or Israelis
or British
or the French,
but man,
if you're
either a
Congolese
or a Serb,
they'll throw
your ass
in there
right away.
Still,
this is from
the creator
and refiner
of the concept
of genocide,
the man
whose language
was actively
appropriated
for the
UN Convention
that is,
in theory,
heavily in theory,
that is
international law.
I would
defy
anyone,
anyone,
who has
even the
least idea
of what
Gaza
is like.
To say
that that
description
does not
perfectly fit
not only
what is
happening
there
right now,
but what
has been
happening
there
for decades,
particularly
since
2008
and the
blockade,
which is
something that
I don't know
if many
Westerners know
about.
I don't know
if they
know about
2008 as
a date
or an
inflection
point,
but the
current
state of
affairs in
Gaza,
or rather
I should
say what
was the
current
state of
affairs in
Gaza
before the
last week
or so,
really dates
to 2008,
even counting
the unfathomable
carnage of
the 2014
destruction of
Gaza,
the regime
of blockades
and sanctions,
the inability
to get
basically anything
that human
beings need
to create
basically anything
like a
society.
That's
to 08,
and many,
many,
many,
many Gazans
have spent
their entire
lives under
this regime
of sanctions
and blockades.
I'm guessing
a lot of you
probably know
this now
because it's
been cited
a lot
in the last
week,
but half
of Gaza
is children.
Half
of Gaza
is children.
A full
half of it.
Anytime
Israel
drops a
bomb in
Gaza,
it knows
by definition
there's a
50-50 chance
this is going
to kill a
child.
I saw
some
fucking
Israeli
mouthpiece
talking earlier
about,
you know,
Hamas
slaughter of
children
and someone
bringing up
the point
that Israel
is murdering
children by
the hundreds
and probably
thousands
at this
very moment.
And this
person said,
well,
you can't
compare the
targeted
killing of
children to
killing children
by accident
in a bombing
run.
By accident.
By accident.
Those are the
two words you
want to use.
In a place
you know
is half
children,
if you
drop a
bomb,
one at
all,
even if it
doesn't
fucking go
off,
that is a
crime against
humanity.
That is an
unfathomable
crime.
And in
defining the
state of
affairs in
Gaza,
and not
just right
now,
not just
right now,
but for
years now
as a
genocide,
and this
as perhaps
I fear,
I deeply
fear,
the culmination
of a
genocide,
the point
at which
a genocide
transforms
into an
extermination.
I just
want to
tell you
some very
basic
factual
information
about Gaza
that you
may or
may not
know.
I think
people
generally
know more
than they
did a
week ago,
but it's
often not
laid out
in the
stark
immediacy
that is
necessary.
This is
just a
little list
of interesting
factoids
about Gaza
life,
and remember
everything I
say here,
half these
people are
children,
and I
believe it's
something like
47-48% of
them are
children 15
or younger,
which means
children who
have lived
their entire
lives under
the blockade,
and I want
to thank,
before I say
this,
Comrade
Sweezy and
Kans
Molman on
Twitter for
alerting me
to this
information,
and to
the person
who originally
found it,
who I
believe is
Sarah Roy.
In Gaza,
people live
with the
constant loud
background buzz
of surveillance
drones and
Israeli military
flyovers.
Kids who
have never
eaten sugar,
kids who
have never
had clean
water in
their lives,
have seen
trillions of
dollars of
military hardware
fly over
them every
day for
their entire
lives.
It is never
quiet.
There is
always at
least a
faint metallic
droning that
you know
perfectly well
if you live
there.
It comes
from machines
designed to
keep you under
surveillance and
when the moment
should prove
propitious to
kill you.
There are
surveillance cameras
and checkpoints
everywhere.
I wasn't able
to get a
precise number
of the
military
checkpoints
in Gaza.
I know in
the West Bank
there are
about 560
Israeli
checkpoints.
So if you
want to go
anywhere,
you have to
go through a
gate with a
bunch of
Israeli soldiers
with machine
guns,
with guard
dogs,
who will
fuck you
over for
nothing,
for amusement,
and who
will kill
you at
anything they
perceive as
the mildest
sort of
aggravation.
There is
nothing they
cannot consider
being provoked.
And in this,
you start to
see the
influence of
the IDF
being called
in to train
so many
American police
forces.
This is where
the pigs here
learned it,
from the pigs
there.
There are
snitches and
informants
everywhere.
You cannot
ever talk to
anyone,
even one-on-one,
even in an
unelectrified
basement.
Forget fucking
cell phones.
You can't
talk to
anyone with
the certainty
that this
person is not
about to rat
you out.
And whether
the person
rats you out
for something
you actually
said or did
versus the
person completely
counterfeiting
imaginary charges
in order to
reap the reward
for them,
you have no
idea.
There's
absolutely no
way to
know.
In Gaza,
something like
95% of the
water is
completely unfit
for human
beings.
It is
almost totally
contaminated
with human
shit.
Because of
that, 75%
of children
and almost
40% of
pregnant women
are badly
malnourished
from lack of
food and
diarrheal
epidemics
thanks to
the fecal
contagion
in the
water.
There is
absolutely
no reliance
on the
idea that
you'll be
able to
wash a
dish or
take a
shower or
have a
drink.
Those things
are completely
outside the
remit of
everyday
Gazan life.
And speaking
of malnutrition,
in Gaza,
there have
been very
precise
calculations
by the
Israeli
state
about
letting
food
through
the
blockades.
And
just
enough
food
gets
through
to
keep
Gazans
horribly
malnourished
but barely
alive.
They don't
quite starve
them to
death.
They starve
them right
to the
edge of
death.
So
virtually
everyone
there
is in
horrible
gnawing
hunger
all the
time.
And
horrible
gnawing
hunger
does
terrible
things
to your
brain.
It does
terrible
things
to your
ability
to sleep
which
does
terrible
things
to your
ability
to think
which
anyone
who's
been up
for four
or five
days
in a
row
knows
that
you
are
basically
sleepwalking
through
hell
at that
point.
You
are
a
docile
mutable
zombie
with
very
little
of
anything
that
would
normally
be
considered
free
will.
And
whether
or not
the state
of Israel
is aware
of this
fact
and
I
cannot
imagine
that they
are
unaware
but even
if you
want to
give them
the benefit
of the
doubt
even
if you
don't
want to
call
this
a
matter
of
direct
influence
let's
say
call it
the anxiety
of influence
you know
like
Harold
Bloom
that
technique
giving
people
just
enough
food
to
keep
them
on
the
edge
of
starvation
without
actually
starving
them
to
death
that
is
a
technique
imported
directly
from
Nazi
concentration
camps
I'm
sure
it's
been
used
elsewhere
I'm
sure
it
was
not
a
novel
technique
as
of
1942
but
I
would
think
the
Israelis
of
all
people
would
be
particularly
able
to
associate
that
technique
with
the
Holocaust
in
Gaza
Israel
keeps
out
80%
of
the
materials
that
would
be
needed
for
basic
sanitation
projects
these
are
kept
out
it's
not
that
they
don't
have
them
it's
not
that
they
can't
get
them
it's
that
they
are
kept
out
which
means
not
only
the
water
but
the
soil
is
contaminated
essentially
everywhere
there
are
no
basic
supplies
or
conditions
for
safe
medicine
and
this
is
the
thing
that
really
makes
me
as
I've
used
this
line
a few
times
on the
show
makes
me
want
to
tear
my
teeth
out
thinking
of
Israel
cutting
power
and
water
to
the
hospitals
in
Gaza
and
not
just
the
horror
stories
you
hear
about
nurses
having
to
clean
bullet
wounds
with
dish
soap
those
are
bad
enough
but
all
the
premature
babies
in
incubators
on
respirators
intubated
with
feeding
tubes
all
the
people
who
need
ventilators
remember
we still
got
COVID
it
didn't
go
anywhere
all
the
people
who
rely
on
any
kind
of
machinery
to
keep
them
alive
all
the
people
on
dialysis
all
the
people
who
need
blood
transfusions
all
the
people
with
long
term
serious
diseases
and
I'm
talking
about
before
the
violence
starts
or
rather
I should
say
before
this
round
of
violence
starts
Israel
is making
the
conscious
and
frankly
unashamed
decision
to murder
all those
people
in
cutting
fuel
electricity
water
to
hospitals
in
Gaza
whether
every
one
of
them
ends
up
dying
is
immaterial
to the
fact
that Israel
has
consented
to
committing
their
murders
even
if
every
person
lives
which
I
dearly
hope
could
be
the
case
Israel
has
still
in
effect
to
any
basic
ethical
standard
attempted
to
murder
them
sorry
in
Gaza
there
are
unprecedented
rates
of
clinical
depression
and
suicide
there
is
massive
unemployment
and
systematic
underdevelopment
it's
you look
at Gaza
and see
this
blighted
hellscape
and I
think a
lot of
westerners
assume
well the
people there
can't
can't
build
a society
people
there
don't
understand
civilization
no
fuck
you
no
it
has
been
underdeveloped
and not
haphazardly
underdeveloped
with a
very direct
aim
in mind
by the
state of
Israel
to keep
these people
essentially
outside of
civilization
every
year
or rather
I should
say every
few years
well
probably
every year
too
because
in between
the major
flare-ups
we hear
about
there are
rocket
strikes
and shit
all the
time
I was
going to
say major
wars
but I've
noticed
in an
interesting
part of
the
Israeli
American
lexicon
it turns
out
listen to
this
when
Israel
kills
a bunch
of
civilians
that's
a war
I guess
but
when
Israel
has to
fight
another
army
that's
a
terrorist
attack
which is
not how
I thought
it worked
I was
under the
impression
as Bill
Hicks
once said
that a
war was
two
armies
fighting
but no
to Israel
a war
is one
army
decimating
children
and if
anyone
fights
back
that's
terrorism
so
Gaza
is reduced
to rubble
over and
over and
over and
it stays
that way
because
there's no
supplies to
rebuild
anything
there are
not enough
healthy people
even to
clear the
wreckage
away
imagine
growing up
with that
imagine
that on
every block
probably
multiple times
on every
block
in the only
city
you've ever
been to
in your
life
there are
just
the
scored
carbonized
destroyed
remains
of buildings
and you
know
perfectly
well
how they
got that
way
imagine
what that
would make
you think
about
the future
as a
general
concept
how you
would start
numbering
the future
in terms
of
buildings
that
can be
knocked
down
before
they're the
buildings
that
you're
in
because
statistics
alone
dictate
that at
some point
it's going
to be
you
there aren't
that many
buildings
and
this is a
point I
have really
seen
inadequately
emphasized
about Gaza
and
architecture
and civic
engineering
Gaza is
I believe
it definitely
it was
during the
2014
I'll call it
Israeli terrorist
attacks
state sponsored
terrorist
attacks
and I
believe
still is
the single
most overcrowded
piece of
land on
earth
the most
people
living on
the smallest
amount of
land
almost two
and a half
million people
in that tiny
little strip
now what
does that
mean
architecturally
it means
high rises
what does
that mean
it means
buildings
with lots
and lots
and lots
of people
in them
shitty
shabby
edge of
falling over
buildings
absolutely
fucking
stuffed with
people
because there's
nowhere near
enough space
for the
average person
to have his
or her own
house
not even
the average
family
and you
will notice
at first
I thought
this was
just sloppy
translation
and now
I'm beginning
to wonder
how intentional
it is
you will
hear
reports
of
Palestinians
describing
what is
happening
to them
and you'll
see the
word house
used
they bombed
my house
they knocked
down my
house
and then
the person
will say
200 people
died
now this is
in translation
of course
so the
translator is
giving you
the phrase
they knocked
over my
house
and 200
people
died
when he
says
she says
house
that's
clearly
referring
to one
of these
high rises
but there
were 200
people
in a fucking
two story
nice little
starter home
for a family
expecting a
baby
no it
was a
skyscraper
and I
thought at
first that's
just sloppy
work on the
part of people
interpreting
and now I'm
beginning to
wonder how
many times
you see
house
and that
means a
building with
300 people
in it
and when
a large
population is
brutally
overcrowded
into a
tiny piece
of land
like that
and is
forced to
live on
top of
itself like
that
that doesn't
just mean
high rises
as an
architectural
matter
that means
targets
because high
rises are
great targets
if you want
to carry out
the complete
extermination
of a
people
you could
not ask
for a
better
situation
or rather
let's say
it as it
is
Israel and
its backers
could not
have created
a better
situation
than a
tiny
impoverished
piece of
land
where everybody
has to
live in
tall
apartment
complexes
stuffed on
top of
each other
that is
at this
point given
the
predomination
of air
power
the single
easiest
kind of
population
to decimate
if not
destroy
completely
and who
would that
air power
we in the
West
fucking
love air
power
because it
it has
some kind
of moral
cleanliness
to it
you know
there's
there's always
been a bit
of a
chivalric
pretension
around the
existence of
air forces
people who
would you
know
literally
call
themselves
knights
of the
sky
if I'm
not mistaken
George H.W.
Bush used
to use
that term
to describe
his time
as a
naval
pilot
naval
aviator
in which
incidentally
he let
other people
on his
plane die
because it
got shot
and he
bailed out
before they
could
but
the future
is what
matters here
right
we love
bombing
campaigns
because
it
abrogates
individual
responsibility
the same
reason
essentially
that in
your
classical
firing
squad
they would
have
10 guys
shoot at
the prisoner
to be
executed
right
the idea
there was
not that
it takes
10 guys
it's that
if you
have 10
guys
every one
of them
can tell
himself
I wasn't
the one
who killed
them
it was
the other
ones
it had
to be
somebody
else's
bullet
it wasn't
my
bullet
I didn't
kill
anyone
I'm
not a
murderer
and
air power
has now
adopted
or rather
been adopted
into that
cultural niche
by the west
in general
so that
Israeli
bombing
dropping
bombs
on a
squalid
overcrowded
slum of
high-rise
apartment
buildings
whose population
is half
children
that's
not
violence
no
shooting
someone
with a
gun
is
violence
stabbing
someone
with a
knife
is
violence
but
a
billion
dollars
a day
worth
of bombs
and rockets
into
a man-made
hell
full of
children
that's
national
security
I don't
know what
you want
us to do
about it
and speaking
of national
security
and of
its effects
in Gaza
in 2015
there were
100,000
homeless people
there
and the
latest estimates
are that
that number
is now closer
to 400,000
people
thanks to
the last
week
and 1500
of them
in 2014
or 2015
pardon me
were orphans
you would have
to imagine
a lot more
orphans
now
in Gaza
72%
of households
qualify as
food insecure
that means
children
forced out
of school
to work
and what
do you
think
children
forced out
of school
to work
leads to
it leads
to not
just sweatshops
horrible labor
exploitation
it leads
to child
prostitution
among
many
many
other things
and again
this is
this is
no accident
this
this is
no mistake
it is not
as if
you could
not construct
some system
of employment
and social
welfare
in which
this didn't
happen
it is happening
because
we
by which I
mean
America
Israel
Canada
UK
most of
Western Europe
because we
want it to
because we
want
children
to be
taken out
of school
to earn
money for
their families
because those
families have
no fucking
food
and
if earning
money means
being sex
trafficked
well
you know
market forces
what are you
going to do
about them
the invisible
hand
the invisible
hand of the
market has
reached down
from the sky
and pushed
an eight-year-old
into a stranger's
fucking van
there
pardon me
there are
four to six
hours of
electricity
daily
during
peacetime
in Gaza
to the extent
that there is
ever peacetime
that is not
enough electricity
to run a
sanitation plant
that is why
all the water
is contaminated
with shit
and as people
there have
noted
from the
moment
Israel
cuts off
the power
and fuel
because
think how
fucking
horrifying
this is
people know
how long
it takes
for this
to happen
because it's
happened to
them so many
times already
from the
moment Israel
cuts off
electricity
and fuel
you have
maybe two
hours
before the
streets start
running with
raw sewage
and they're
not running
with raw
sewage
with no
people in
them
everyone is
in the
street
because the
fucking
buildings are
gone
which means
diseases like
cholera are
going to be
unfathomably
common among
whatever part of
the population
can survive
between 2008
and 2013
alone
five years
Gaza had
a 70%
increase
in infant
mortality
maybe from
the preceding
numbers
you can guess
why
and at
the rate
Israel
allows
construction
materials
into Gaza
it would
take
174 years
of peace
to rebuild
Gaza to
where it
was in
2014
2014
the year
of another
massive
horrific
bombing
campaign
it is now
so far
gone
beyond even
that point
that we
should essentially
assume
that Gaza
will never be
rebuilt at this
point
which I suspect
is one of
Israel's primary
aims here
because in
talking
about
genocide
I did
want to make
clear that
genocide
is something
more and
other than
just
extermination
but extermination
is the
final phase
and if people
aren't stopped
if nations
aren't stopped
is the
inevitable
phase
that is what
it is always
leading to
and I
cannot help
but watch
this genocide
and think
of
you remember
the idea
I talked
about
I can't
remember
when
what I
call
the
reservation
of a
place
in a
given
culture
or society
where
people
who
qualify
usually
by means
of
money
but
sometimes
birth
family
status
whatever
are sort
of
given
a little
island
to live
as if
they were
free
for a
little
while
I was
talking
about
shit
like
music
festivals
you know
hey
you got
a few
hundred
will cordon
off a
big
fucking
field
and you
can do
whatever
drugs
you want
cops
won't
give a
shit
and you'll
get to
pretend
that you're
free
while other
people
you know
doing like
jobs
around you
people who are
actually
contributing to
the crumbling
fucking
infrastructure
and social
framework
have to
look at
you
in the
middle
of their
bleakest
unfreedom
and watch
you
paying
for the
opportunity
to simulate
freedom
in the
context of
this genocide
I cannot
help but
think
of a
rave
next to
a
concentration
camp
just say
those words
again to
yourself
say them
with me
a rave
next to
a
concentration
camp
and look
the
the stories
are still
very spotty
as to
what happened
at that
rave
from what
I have
seen
it would
appear
that the
Hamas
fighters
who landed
there
were
shooting
at
IDF
that
the
casualties
in the
crowd
were part
of a
crossfire
between
Hamas
and IDF
I don't
know if
that's
true
I'm
certainly
not
happy
anyone
died
I
certainly
don't
hope
these
people
were killed
for
ideological
reasons
Christ
of course
not
but a
rave
next to
a
concentration
camp
that is
an image
that is
not going
to leave
me for
years
and years
and years
because
I want
you all
to know
unless
there is
some sort
of
unfathomable
change
unless
there is
a
political
alteration
of a
scale
that I
genuinely
cannot
imagine
that is
what the
future
is
a rave
next to
a
concentration
camp
I
think
Israel
is
going
to
pursue
this
genocide
as far
as they
can
I
think
they
have
decided
that
they
are
beyond
the
power
of
public
opinion
to
stop
and
I
think
the
Palestinians
have
decided
that
no matter
what
they try
to do
to court
public
opinion
no one
ever
helps
them
which
is
not
wrong
they
are
not
incorrect
and
I
think
Israel
is
using
this
moment
to
push
for
full
extermination
I
think
it
is
trying
to
kill
everyone
who
won't
leave
Gaza
they
say
as if
they
can
just
leave
as if
a
Gazan
can
just
step
over
the
border
into
Egypt
and
ask
for
a
passport
I
think
the
plan
is
to
kill
everyone
they
find
there
and
as I
said
Gaza
under
current
conditions
is
essentially
unrebuildable
it
just
isn't
going
to
recover
from
the
scale
of
purely
material
damage
it
suffered
in the
last
week
I
don't
think
they
want
it
to
recover
I
don't
think
they're
planning
on
it
recovering
I
think
they
want
to
kill
whoever
they
find
and
bulldoze
the
rest
and
maybe
make
it
something
futuristic
like
free
enterprise
zone
for
tech
startup
that's
what I
think
is
coming
and
the
rave
next to
the
concentration
camp
was
to
me
a
horrifying
crystallization
of
everything
that I
have
been
fearing
about
the
future
for
a
long
time
that
people
imagine
a
universalist
apocalypse
an
equitable
apocalypse
an apocalypse
of mutual
shared
suffering
this will
not be
the case
between
the
massive
revitalization
of
fascist
politics
and fascist
governments
with
the
support
of
the
people
who
rule
the
world
the
western
capitalist
block
with
the
massive
proliferation
of
weapons
the
incredible
ease
of accessing
and using
weaponry
compared to
50 years
ago
even
with
the
economic
inequality
even in
wealthy
societies
that at
this point
can no
longer really
be described
by the
phrase
economic
inequality
it is
fully
class
striation
it is
oligarchy
and then
everyone else
it's
plutocracy
and the
rest of
us
that's it
it's not
inequality
that implies
that there is
some chance
of salvaging
it in
its current
form
as if we
could just
pop some
fucking
numbers
into an
algorithm
and solve
it
no no
no no
no
this is a
new
class
bifurcation
this is a
class
system
in the
oldest
sense
of the
word
class
we're not
even talking
about the
marxist
concept of
class here
of course
that plays
into it
but it also
goes deeper
than that
this is
class
in a
medieval
sense
and of
course
with the
uh
ever hastening
ever more
rapidly
approaching
collapse
of any
environment
that the
mass of
humanity
will be
able to
survive
in
this is
what I
see
this is
what I
expect
from the
next
50 years
if it
even takes
50 years
I expect
the massive
humanity
in concentration
camps
and the
rest
the ones
who could
afford to
buy their
way out
the ones
who built
the concentration
camps
uh
at a
rave
I expect
a
party
next to
Auschwitz
that goes
on as
deep into
the night
as you
can imagine
and
the time
will pass
and pass
and pass
and you'll
keep thinking
shouldn't it
be morning
by now
shouldn't the
sun be
rising
shouldn't
shouldn't
the sky
be at
least
lightning
a little
bit
and
the night
will
just keep
getting
darker
well I
grew up
in the
client
state
of a
petro
king
with a
complicated
take on
things like
human rights
but baby
that's
the sacrifice
for bringing
joy
to the
world
and
I learned
young
how the
west was
one
with
Christ
big
heart
and a
bigger
gun
it
wasn't
enough
so we
took
the moon
cause
night
sea rock
it's
science
too
can
bring
joy
to
the
world

can't we all just get along
like Amazon
and
rate the old
coming together
to make a drone
to bring us lunch
and kill the sun
in a city
just a two for one
holistic joy
to the world
please stop resisting all the joy
in your world
just a car full of celebrities
singing about the joy
in your
mind
in your
bow
A string of bad luck in this final turn
We gathered around and watched our cities burn
Who could have possibly predicted this?
Said everyone
So we boldly venture into the black
Guided by a grand soundtrack
We'll liberate some foreign stars
And stick a flag on the face of Mars
The beauty of starting again
Impatience, zero and original sin
The mantra rings across the land
How clever
Look at us, we've done it again
We're bringing joy
To hold new worlds
You must admit
We've certainly got a knife for bringing joy
To hold new worlds
In time these aliens will run all out of the jar
We'll bring our whole new worlds
We're bringing joy
To your world
You better hope
You don't have cheap bananas or ice
We're bringing joy
To your world
You better hope
You don't have cheap bananas or ice
We're bringing joy
To your world
You better hope
You don't have cheap bananas or ice
We're bringing joy
We're bringing joy
To ourازs
We're bringing joy
To our saint
And we were bringing joy

We're bringing joy
