Hi listeners, this is Abbey. Today we're going to be watching a film called The People's Joker,
which is very indie. It was kind of made with a lot of love. It's a little bit scrappy in places.
And it kind of relates to something that I was listening to this morning. I was listening to
an episode of one of my favorite podcasts, Never Post, and they were doing a roundtable
discussion with a lot of people in the podcasting industry, which I was surprised to hear is having
a massive crisis. Is it?
Apparently, yeah, apparently all the money is leaving. Nobody can get sponsorships anymore.
There's no ad money anymore. There was some big podcaster they were discussing who said
that in order to make a sustainable living podcasting, you need 200,000 downloads per episode.
And I was like, what the fuck? This seems so weird because over here at Kill James Bond Towers,
we're all doing pretty good, making a decent living doing this.
Home of independent podcasting.
Yeah, we're completely independent.
We've never done ads.
Never run a single ad, as far as I'm aware.
We've never been asked.
No one's ever even asked us to do it.
We've never even had to turn somebody down.
Yeah.
I did have to download NordVPN to watch this movie.
If you want to hit me up about that.
Yeah, nobody's approached us to run it out.
No big podcasting production company has ever reached out to us or asked to acquire us or
anything.
We do live shows occasionally and the audience is fucking great.
So it's weird that we're doing really well.
Every listener of Kill James Bond counts as 100 normal podcast listeners.
Yeah, you do.
They're just that much stronger, more loyal.
That's handsome, I would say.
Absolutely.
The other weird thing is that the podcasting industry just doesn't have any fucking clue
who we are.
We've never been nominated for any kind of award.
As I said, we've never been approached by any sort of production, anybody.
We were asked to do a podcasting industry show one time and I went along and then I refused
to go on stage because the other panelists had a history of transphobic comments and I said,
I'm not doing it.
And like, that's it.
That's for like no one in the podcasting industry.
This is why they don't talk to us though.
Has any fucking clue what Kill James Bond is.
And it's like everyone else is fucking melting down.
I'm working like five jobs to keep their podcast going.
Imagine.
They're like big, big people like NPR and shit.
They're just like, what are we doing?
There's no money in podcasting anymore.
And we're just like three trans idiots doing the best film criticism of the last 40 years.
Just like fucking bossing it.
So I wanted to say to the listeners in the spirit of independent media and stuff that is made
scrappily and with love.
Hey, thanks for fucking being here.
Because you dudes, you're doing so good.
I didn't even know our industry was in crisis.
Like just found out about the crisis.
Yeah.
To our fellow podcasters.
Hey, stay strong.
Have you considered getting good?
Like, sorry that that happened to you.
I'm looking at our email here just in case we've missed all of these emails or something.
Yeah.
Doesn't look like it.
It really just seems that people really relate to, I mean, what we're doing.
You could say that we've invented a style of anti-podcasting.
You might even call it.
Chaos podcasting.
Fuck's sake.
Hello and welcome to another episode of Kill James Bond.
I am November Kelly.
I am joined as always by my chaos podcasting colleagues, Abigail Thorne and Devin.
Hey, how's it going?
What's up?
The first all penguin, all trans podcast.
No, we watched The People's Joker and I gotta be honest, I'm in a kind of like emotionally
vulnerable state with this one because like I often find that like how much you relate
to a movie doesn't make for very good movie criticism.
But in this case, I can't help it.
This is a movie that I feel has been like laser targeted on my position.
And all of the ways in which I kind of bounced off something like I saw the TV glow are all
ways in which I deeply connected with The People's Joker.
And this has very rapidly become one of my favorite movies.
And so I'm just like, hell fucking yeah.
Whereas I'm, I'm the complete opposite.
Like I, this, this movie is about.
It was shit.
No, no, I loved it.
I had a great time watching this.
Let me be clear.
It was good.
It was good.
But I can do like film criticism and analysis of it because it's a film about being a trans
person, being a closeted trans person.
It's like similar themes to I Saw the TV glow and that it's also a love letter to a particular
kind of media.
But I don't relate to this particular kind of trans story at all because I'm a freak
and there's something wrong with me and I'm AGP.
There's two kinds of trans.
That's right.
That's what I'm hearing.
We've seen two kinds of trans film and of the two trans women on the podcast, one of
us is related to a different one each, which means scientifically there are two kinds of
trans women and I'm this kind.
There's the People's Joker kind.
And then there's the I Saw the TV glow kind.
And you now as the audience can like arrange yourselves by faction here really easily.
You can be a secret third thing, which is to be of the prince kind of trans person.
But yeah, I just kind of, this is just a little glimpse into my twisted mind that these are
the things that I consider to be normal.
It's almost as if she considers transition funny.
To the Joker, this is a normal film.
Yeah.
I mean, where do we want to start with this?
We've got to start with a disclaimer.
Which the film starts with.
Yeah.
This is legal.
This is a legal film to make.
It's legal to do this.
It's a parody, all right?
Yeah.
It's legal to do this?
They can't stop you.
It's fine.
From using the intellectual property of Warner Brothers and like Saturday Night Live.
They can't stop you making a 3D Lorne Michaels in your movie.
No.
They can't make you not do that.
So we open with a disclaimer, which says that everything we're about to see is fair use,
like all copyrights to Warner Brothers, Discovery and DC Comics, who may I, Abigail Thorne, just
add, make great comic books and great movies.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And also the film tells us that it was made during COVID.
Yeah.
Couldn't tell.
And we open on a TV that shows us a world falling apart.
There's war on the news.
There's been something called the Cyber Wars, which we never really found out what they are.
And this animated Alex Jones style conspiracy theorist broadcaster is ranting and raving
about everything's going wrong.
Like the woke, the DEI, the transgenders, they're taken over.
When will Batman save us?
And meanwhile, our lead character, Joker the Harlequin, is watching the news and I might not
say smoking transsexually.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yes.
This is our lead, Vera Drew, who I believe wrote and directed?
I think so.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Directed at the start, playing the Joker, brackets trans femme.
And she's really fucking good.
Right.
And sets out the stall of this movie immediately, which is, this is your trans femme coming of
age comic book movie.
Right.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
This is a lot more like my trans experience.
I think it's a lot more confident in some ways.
Mm-hmm.
She starts with childhood, right, with her childhood.
And the only, and like growing up through TV as well.
So like a point in common here.
But we get through the TV-ness of this very quickly, right?
Of like the only trans woman that I ever saw, like growing up on TV were like dead sex
workers or jokes on like Jerry Springer.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, so just kind of pump the brakes a little bit.
We'll go kind of beat by beat.
Sure.
Because she tells us the audience, she said, ever since I was a kid, I always wanted to
be Joker.
She grew up in the Midwest.
Lovely little touch.
She grew up in Smallville.
Uh-huh.
And her favorite show was UCB, the United Clown Bureau, which is like Saturday Night Live.
Yeah, SNL.
But everyone on it is the Joker.
Yeah.
Little dig at Upright Citizens for right there as well too.
But yeah.
There's so much in this that I didn't pick up.
Like I picked up a lot of the comic book references because there's so many like DC
comics references and Batman references, which I love.
There's a nice touch, which is that, um, so we see her as a child and I believe that
actor is a boy.
And there's a nice touch, which is that her dead name is bleeped out.
Yes.
Yeah, I really like that.
So when her mom comes in and says like, oh, what are you doing?
And like, we don't hear it.
It's nice.
Yeah.
I really like that.
For the first couple, I did think that she was calling him faggot the whole time,
but like, it took me, I'm going to say an embarrassingly long time to realize that
that's not what was happening there.
That would be an incredible dead name.
It would be.
Yeah.
If your dead name was just faggot.
I've named my, my ostensibly cisgender son, the F-slur.
You're talking about the references.
That is one place that I think our analysis as Brits is going to suffer somewhat is that
none of us grew up watching Saturday Night Live.
Like we don't, there's going to be a shitload of references in this, but I'm just not going
to really understand because I don't know what the fuck's going on.
I hear you people find that shit funny.
I don't know.
I've looked at it myself.
I'll try and engage our baked bean brains and fucking like get some of it.
Anyway.
So there's a nice, there's a nice moment where, where, so she's bouncing on the bed and she's,
you know, excited, pretending to be in UCB and her mom is worried.
And then we get this moment where Joker as an adult tells us, well, you know, me wanting
to be a Joker should have been the least of her concerns.
Cause you know, I'm trans and why not say she said the word.
Yes.
Yeah.
Not a metaphor.
Yeah.
At all.
This is the thing.
There was discourse about, about, I saw the TV glow that I thought was very unfair on both
sides.
I thought it was symptomatic of a very like wounded and tense community, right?
Where someone said about.
It sucked, but it was great.
They kicked it off right before we dropped the episode.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Really good.
But, but, uh, somebody said about, I saw the TV glow as a point of criticism, but it
doesn't even say the word trans, right?
And in our sort of current circumstances, they saw this as being a cowardly thing to do.
Right.
And I don't think it was accurate as film criticism in the sense that that's a movie about not being
able to have the word to say the thing, but like.
Yeah.
Like it's sort of the point that they don't know.
I take the broader point.
And I think it was, it was well expressed in a more general sense, which is that there
are not a lot of movies that are willing to say the word transgender with their chest.
Right.
And this movie absolutely does.
And also says the word cisgender.
Yes.
Which I love because I mean, listeners, spoilers that not really spoilers for the film, but
like spoilers for the trans agenda.
The word cis is the woke mind virus.
That's why the BBC never say it because it implies that we are two sides of the same coin
and that we are equal and that there's nothing wrong with being trans.
It's enough to make you become the fucking Joker.
Yes, it is.
I really like that this film just fucking says it.
Like, this is not a metaphor.
This is about being fucking trans.
Shut up and say that.
Also, the mother here as well, as she's a different kind of like mum than you usually
see in like these kind of coming of age narratives, because what she is is kind of like hypochondriac,
like Munchausen's by proxy kind of like very high strung, very tense, very anxious.
Very manic, very overbearing.
Yeah.
Yeah, absolutely.
It's cool.
And she takes young Joker to see a Batman film.
It's like bad CGI.
It's the Joel Schumacher one.
It's the Joel Schumacher Batman and Robin with the bat nipples.
Yeah, it's the bat nips one.
Yeah, it is.
And we get this moment, which I did in fact relate to, where young Joker isn't watching
Batman.
People are like, oh yeah, everybody wanted to be Batman, like run around and fuck Nicole Kidman.
I wanted to be Nicole Kidman.
And like, oh yeah, yeah, I got that.
Yeah.
Genuinely.
And I think the other thing that I really like about this is that it doesn't just present
being trans explicitly.
It presents it as something that's like absolutely normal.
Right?
Like Joker's response to seeing this scene in Batman and Robin is to be like, is this
why they rate movies like this?
Because seeing like a romance scene between Batman and Nicole Kidman is going to make boys
want to grow up to be Nicole Kidman.
Right?
It's an absolutely kind of like naturally arising thing where something like I saw the TV
glow is sorry to keep making this comparison.
We did see them back to back presented as like being trans is this kind of like existential
struggle that happens inside you.
Here it's something that's like quite external where it's like you tell your slightly hysteric
mother that you think you were born in the wrong body and she slams the brakes on the
car and immediately takes you to Arkham fucking asylum.
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
We do get this lovely moment where she says, well, yeah, I couldn't really tell her I was
trans because there wasn't a lot of good trans representation, but we get two TV shows.
Yes.
One of them.
I'm pointing at the screen.
It's just called Suicide Cop.
Suicide Cop.
It is based on the memoir by anyone is extremely funny for a show called Suicide Cop, but it's
specifically the memoir by Jim Gordon.
Commission Gordon.
Fucking hell.
And it's a cop who just goes, wait, so she's a he?
And then just immediately goes.
It's so good.
The other side of this coin is trans woman on Jerry Springer getting yelled at and I
point at the screen and go, yo, that's Mia.
It's Mia Moore.
Yeah.
It's Mia Martin.
Mia Moore Martin.
Also, it's not even Jerry Springer.
It's Jack Ryan.
Another lovely little like DC Comics.
Jack Ryan is a character in Batman.
Yeah.
But yeah, as you say, like she tries to come out to her mom and her mom just sends her to
Arkham Asylum.
Yeah.
She says it in the car in as much as he goes like, mum, am I born in the wrong body?
And immediately like brakes are on.
Turns around straight to Arkham Asylum.
We're going to fix this fucking kid right now.
As an experience of child and adolescent mental health services, this is a fucking great use
of a comic book kind of pastiche, I think, to reinforce, wait a second, this is really
creepy and evil, right?
This is not somewhere where they're actually going to help you.
And this doctor has a pretty fucking weird and like villainous attitude.
Yeah.
You're on the fucking waiting list for Arkham Asylum?
No, this is more like they send you to like mental health services because you're sad,
right?
Because you're depressed.
And they put you on antidepressants, which are here at Smilex, right?
They give you the Joker grin and make you smile.
I really like the, because all of this business is very sort of fast paced.
It's easy to get sort of like caught up in it.
But I really do like the way that this scene is written between Dr. Crane, who is also the
name of Scarecrow in the comics, and the mom and young Joker here.
Because the mom does all the talking and says that like, you know, when he, when he, my
beautiful boy says this, it hurts my feelings and it makes me feel sad.
Like she turns it into a therapy session for her.
And the doctor takes her sign.
It's like, do you see how much you're hurting your mother by persisting in this?
Exactly.
Yeah.
I've been in this fucking conversation.
So am I.
It's crazy.
And young Joker has this like, oh, I'm sorry, mom.
I didn't realize I was hurting you.
Like, I love you.
I will, you know, she's like, I just want my happy, smiling boy back.
And so she takes the Smilex that gives you the Joker gas.
It's like, yeah, I'm so happy.
It's like, we're going to force you to be happy this way.
But I really loved, it was like really touching the way that this was written.
That like the mom was so invested in her quote unquote son being happy that she was able
to do anything to get that, even though it was clearly making her daughter miserable.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We skip forward a bit at this point.
Yes.
Now it's maybe a, so adolescence passes in a sort of haze of surreal animation and trash
TV.
20 years later, you know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And like dodgy green screen.
And so maybe now's the time to talk about the green screen.
God, it's so good.
It's most of the movie.
Yeah.
Most of the movie is green screened.
It fits perfectly with like pastiche.
It's incredible.
I was trying to figure out how to say like, it's bad, but it's also great.
In that like the green screening is not done well.
Like the angles don't always matter.
Like technically it's not, it's not what you think green screening should be.
I mean, all the, all the keying is done well enough.
I didn't see much like green haze in that regard.
It's better than Mamma Mia 2.
Yeah.
Another movie about being trans.
Some of the angles don't always work.
And like, yeah, it seems like unusual and disjointed.
Like sometimes the continuity is a little bit off.
And I think that fucking works perfectly in this moment.
It's like a choice in this moment that works really well.
It's so good.
Like it, every, every fucking shot is like just a piece together from people on a green screen.
There's parts of it that looks like a scanner darkly.
Like there are parts of it that are all practical, like stop motion.
Yeah.
Digital effects.
And it's all like nested together in this perfect, perfect hole.
It's just such a beautiful way of telling the story.
It gives the impression of like, what if somebody like took up your, took your memories like a snow globe and just like shook them up and like fucked them up.
And it really works.
It's like trying to look good at all either.
Like there are placeholders that are just like basic 3D models of people that you're supposed to just like, that's a person.
Just don't even worry about it.
Like we're telling the story here and it all works.
There's even a really amazing moment later on that's done with Barbie dolls that have been fucked up, which I loved.
I don't think it works all the time.
I think there's one section where I think it's like a bit of a letdown.
But for right now, at this moment of the film, I think this is a choice that like really, really works.
I think a lot of it's very machinima and like Newgrounds-y as well.
Yes.
It kind of really hits.
Anyway, go ahead, sorry.
But so we see Joker grow up into a teenager and the one, well.
A obviously trans and like obviously some form of like LGBT teenager.
Yes.
And her dirtbag friends being like, are you a faggot?
And her being like, me.
Can you imagine?
Can you imagine me?
Yeah.
Square brackets gaily.
Imagine me just sucking dick and loving it.
Yeah.
But she's still really into Saturday Night Live, right?
And in particular, this comedian Ra's al Ghul, right?
Who's like a bunch of different comedians here.
Yeah.
And it's a way out in a way that I really like.
I think this is the right drop.
Ra's taught me that it didn't matter that I was a shitty, miserable person.
All I had to do was become a comedian because comedians are shitty, miserable people.
Which fucking, it's cooking, you know?
Yeah.
Right?
As someone who I guess is increasingly considering herself a comedian off of this and other things.
Yeah.
So she sets off for Gotham City, which is not quite as we may know it in the comics.
Bruce Wayne, we hear, is retired as Batman.
And everyone knows that Bruce Wayne is Batman now.
He's also running for president.
He's been replaced by these drones, which basically just do all the law and order and also control all the TV.
After the cyber wars, which we still don't know much about.
When she's leaving for Gotham City, a couple of things to note here.
Oh, yeah.
First of all is the mother's reaction, which is, well, I won't be able to help you when you get murdered by all of the terrible things.
Small town American mom.
You're going to die if you move to a city.
Small town American mom, but also slightly hysterical, slightly anxious mom as well.
And also, when she's doing this, she's dressed in this kind of teenage egg fit of black shirt, white tie.
I felt something shift in my psyche and I went back in the archives and I found a photo of myself at 16 years old,
where I'm wearing the exact same fucking fit down to the letter.
They put me in the movie.
They made this one about me.
This is very, yeah, no, I saw the photo.
They put your ass in the movie.
Do you know what's crazy?
I also have one of those photos.
It's the exact same fit.
Wore that same outfit to sixth form.
Yep.
I swear to God, I have the same thing too.
Yeah.
Perfectly domed off.
Oh my God.
If you wore a black shirt with a white skinny tie when you were a teenager, take the fucking
Easter egg.
Yeah.
Become the Joker.
You've got something going on.
Yeah.
But she moves to Gotham City.
UCB is the only way to legally perform comedy in the United States.
Yes.
Which is quite...
Yeah.
And in order to get into it, you have to go through this process of like psychometric
testing where they measure your dick size to make sure it's small enough for you to be
insecure about it.
Yeah.
And then get into this sort of series of improv seminars, like Yes And, which are arranged
in this Scientology-like structure.
Yeah.
It's kind of like a pyramid scheme is what somebody says.
Also references the Cube movies a lot as well.
Yeah.
A lot of hypercube going on.
Yeah.
So we learn that the graduates of UCB are either jokemen or they are harlequins.
And the job of the harlequin is to look sexy and laugh at jokemen's jokes.
Yes.
This is the only way you can legally perform comedy in America.
They're all dressed in the like animated series Harley Quinn.
fit as well.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We also at this point meet Penguin.
Yes.
Penguin.
Penguin.
Hell yeah.
I fucking love this guy.
I love you man.
Penguin is played by Nathan Faustin who is...
Genuinely this performance is amazing.
I love this.
This is like, fuck Colin Farrell.
This is the best Penguin I've ever fucked at Individo.
I agree.
I agree completely.
This is the best interpretation of Penguin I think I've ever seen.
Yeah.
This is the Penguin to me.
I love this portrayal.
This is kind of like schlubby stand-up comedian.
Yeah.
Who just also is the Penguin.
He's got the chin strap beard.
He's got the nose.
The nose.
Painted white face.
And he's like...
Yeah.
When he laughs he goes...
It's so good.
Fucking nailed it.
So we see the Joker does this yes and class and is kind of too insecure to really work
with it.
Yeah.
Well she bombs.
Yeah.
She bombs.
She fails yes and.
Yeah.
I liked this actually.
It had the courage to be like, no she's actually...
This is the thing she really, really wants to do more than anything.
And she sucks at it.
She's shit.
Absolutely.
So a really, really slight joke here that I really like is that they, Joker and Penguin
take a break to not smoke.
Like they go outside and it's like this plume of cigarette smoke from indoors and they're
outside not smoking together in the alley.
Yeah.
Pretty good.
Yeah.
But so Penguin talks about, well they have dinner and Penguin talks about comedy, right?
And what they both want to do with comedy.
And again, Joker's jokes, awful, like reprehensible.
Not good.
No.
Really bad jokes.
Yeah.
It's just like...
Because it's not a joke about her, right?
And as Penguin says, sometimes if you're telling a story about something that happened, you should
do something about something that happened to you because people tend to find that funny.
Well, because her jokes aren't authentic.
They don't come from authentic.
She's like, oh, my girlfriend, like her pussy is so huge or whatever.
And it just bombs.
And then she's like, I've never had a girlfriend.
I don't know.
I've no clue what any of this is.
Yeah.
And then Penguin's just like, yeah, it's not authentic.
I don't know what the normal size of a pussy is, actually.
She can't like perform the kind of standard formalized comedy that is the only comedy allowed
to be shown, which as Penguin says is the same five people pretending their parents
aren't rich doing the same Tinder jokes.
Which is Saturday Night Live.
Yes.
So they decide to open an illegal comedy warehouse.
Yes.
Anti-comedy.
Anti-comedy.
Which, you know, like...
Oh, there's some really good shit in here.
Like, the Penguin very sadly goes like, you know, before it was made illegal, a comedian
used to be able to do like four or five open mic sets at night.
Lucky bastards.
He was like, wow, lucky bastards.
So good.
They sort of signpost the anti-comedy here with like Andy Kaufman and Lenny Bruce, right?
And go, well, we're gonna do this.
If we don't call it comedy, we can still do comedy in this shitty little theater on an
abandoned boardwalk.
It's specifically, it's in Gotham's abandoned amusement district.
And it is called The Red Hood Playhouse, another lovely little DC Comics reference.
The queue of people auditioning outside includes Bane and the villains from Superman 2.
I love, I love this.
Every single shot is so dense with jokes.
It's so good.
It took me so long to watch this fucking movie.
It reminds me of Matthew Lovchansky's book, Boys Weekend.
Yes.
There is never an opportunity missed for a joke in this.
There is like no, like an ounce of this is wasted.
It's beautiful.
It reminds me of like top secret in that way as well.
Yeah.
Just every single.
So some people, some familiar faces come to auditions.
So there's Poison Ivy, who is a kind of like CGI, non-binary, Scottish.
Yeah.
Celina Kyle, Catwoman.
And also the Riddler, whose act is just that he asks Riddles.
They're like, well, it's not really a joke, but yeah, okay.
Yeah.
Bane comes up to like the open mic and just lifts weights for a bit.
Which is really good.
It's really good because like the Joker bombs later on and she's like, Bane is booing her.
And she's like, you just came up here and lifted weights for 15 minutes.
And he just goes, yep, I did.
Unapologetic.
That was what he came there to fucking do.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So let's go, man.
Joker's act still sucks.
She drinks for the first time, which she's not meant to do on antidepressants.
She says like, irrespective of gender, she has no identity.
Right.
And she talks about feeling like she wasn't even sure she exists.
And that's very, very familiar to me.
Right.
It's just kind of like, oh, I don't really feel like I have any like personhood.
You know?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I fully fucking remember that.
I remember, um, I remember thinking that dogs, that strangers dogs in the streets would
walk past me and not look at me because I was invisible to dogs because I didn't have
a soul.
Yeah.
Am I not in sold?
Am I, am I a philosophical zombie?
Like what the fuck?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I used to be convinced that if you ran an infrared scanner over me, I wouldn't show
up.
Like I was invisible to thermal cameras because I was just like, I'm not really alive.
Um, so yeah, fully understood this.
Very relatable.
The club, meanwhile, is like kind of a bit of a, a bit of a hit.
Yeah.
Okay.
People like it.
And she sees and instantly falls for another comedian.
All of the bits where I overshare and talk about personal bits are in relation to this
plot arc.
And that's going to be most of the rest of the podcast.
Okay.
But this is, this is another trans and trans femme experience as well of immediately falling
head over heels, cartoon hearts and eyes in love with the most obviously toxic person
you can because they're the first other trans person you've seen.
And the fact that they introduced this character with the most obnoxious leftist take you can
possibly imagine.
He's doing the open mic night and he's like, no, I know the second amendment gets a bad
rap amongst leftists, right?
It's, I think we all, we've all run into people like this, right?
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
We all know this guy.
Yes.
Being sort of like, very vulnerable to someone like this because it's like, I've never seen
someone like this before.
As Joker says, in the heartbreaking bit of the over-narrative.
Are you the first one that saw me?
The real me?
Why do I hate giving you that credit?
And...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Yes.
Very, very relatable.
But so the person that she sees is a young trans guy.
He's dressed up as the Jared Leto Joker, so he has...
Complete with damage tattoo.
Damaged on his forehead, yeah.
Yes, which is so fucking funny in itself.
To be like, just like, obviously this guy is a piece of shit in so many ways.
He's like...
Yeah.
So his name is Jason Todd, which is kind of a spoiler if you know your comics, but
it just goes by Mr. J. And he sucks, but Joker thinks that he's really, really funny.
Yeah.
And they get talking in a men's room, actually, because Joker is uncomfortable using a urinal,
which again, fucking been there, right?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
And he just kind of like, negs her in...
Like, it's not often I meet someone funnier than me, kind of way.
And it's over, right?
In moments, they're already dating.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
There's like a tunnel of love scene, and yeah.
Mm-hmm.
And we also get this...
We get this...
Yeah, they go in the tunnel of love, and then Joker talks about his top surgery scars and
how he's trans, and Joker is surprised by this, but not against it.
Joker also...
So Mr. J calls her a drag queen at one point?
Yeah, oh God.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, you're bringing it back after drag was made illegal when RuPaul's fracking ranch
exploded and killed a thousand people.
It never misses a joke.
It ever.
Never beat.
With no bit in it.
This is the problem with being a comedian, right?
All of the, like, pathos stuff also has to have a joke in it.
Yeah.
And she starts dressing as a woman for her act.
Like, she has another fight with her mum.
Yeah, her mum comes to visit.
Her mum comes to visit to, like, check in on her.
And, you know, the dad's completely absent.
He exists.
He's still in the family, but, like, he doesn't, like, even show up.
He's never around.
Yeah, yeah.
It's to the bone rules.
He's gone.
Yeah, exactly.
And the moment's like, I don't understand why you're doing this to me, right?
Like, why you have chosen to, like, go and do comedy and, like, grow your hair out and show up still, like, drunk.
And the crux of this is they end up in this screaming argument where Joker finally loses her patience because her mum says, you're always such a happy little boy, right?
And Joker says, you, in the bluntest, cruelest, most possible way, right?
Something which, fucking, they put me in the movie.
You were mentally ill to her mum.
I wasn't mentally ill and now I'm mentally ill because of it.
And it's brutal.
And she leaves.
She storms out.
And then she makes herself the Joker suit, the purple suit with the yellow waistcoat.
She goes on a bender.
She dresses like a girl.
She goes to do her act.
She does the Joker dance on the way out and is absolutely triumphant.
Yeah.
She asks Penguin, like, when you bring me out, could you introduce me as Joker the Holocaust?
And he's like, yeah, sure.
Just perfectly, like, reclaim all of these bits from the movies and just assemble them.
My pronouns are hee-haw.
That's so, so fucking good.
It's genuinely good.
I love, by the way, that pulling the when you introduce me, can you introduce me as Joker line from Joker.
It's just completely flat because there's no reason for it to be anything else.
So Penguin's just like, yeah, sure.
It's just really good.
Will do.
And she nails it.
She gets her act finally where she gets Poison Ivy to come up on stage.
Describe her saddest memory.
And then she takes her antidepressants on stage and, like, laughs at this sad story.
It's really funny and it's really cathartic.
It's really good.
It's a good bit.
It's great.
It's a great bit.
Yeah.
It's really, really good.
And so she proceeds in this, like, relationship with Mr. J where she's kind of, like, dressing as a girl sometimes.
It's interesting, too, because the thing is, it's doing the, like, folie à deux thing.
Where it's like, oh, do you ever, like, meet someone who's the exact same kind of crazy as you are?
And then you listen to what Mr. J is actually saying.
And he's not crazy.
He's just edgy and trans.
He's like, I think our wedding dance should be brick by Ben Folds 5 or whatever.
And it's just like, that's such a fucking dirtbag thing to say.
But it's not that crazy.
And it's just like, these are the ways in which you can, like, make sense of yourself and, like, understand the relationship that you're in.
I like that they don't portray him as cool.
No.
And I think credit to both the writer and the actor here.
He's not portrayed as being, like, cool and sexy.
She reacts to him as if he's cool and sexy, but he is just constantly being pathetic and whiny.
We can see he's got the fucking damaged face tattoo.
Like, it works on, like, five different levels.
And one of them is that it's just, it's cringe.
It's embarrassing, right?
Yeah.
We get this animated sex sequence.
Big pulped collar all the time.
The thing about Mr. J as well is that he's not unsympathetic as well.
Like, you know, we hear him talk about feeling, like, insecure, feeling like a gay guy with an asterisk.
And it just, like, not remembering most of his life, he says.
And it's just like, oh, this is a really familiar kind of disaster, right?
And this is someone who, like, yeah, okay, he's an asshole.
And, like, we'll get into that for sure.
But, like, there are also, like, some, like, you know, the other reason why the damaged tattoo is there, right?
And so we have this animated sequence where they have sex.
He calls her good girl.
And she says, I'd like that.
She calls him puddin', which is a thing from the Batman animated series.
My notes say, the T4T relationship that cracks your egg but is also bad for you.
Yes.
Yeah.
Interesting.
As she says, when you're in love, and she's listening to him perform, doing more of the same act,
when you're in love, even the most self-righteous pop Marxist rants sound like poetry.
For real.
I think, just all reacting off of the same thing for, like, different people there, but, yeah.
Yep.
Yep.
Oh, Jesus.
But, so, yeah, what we then get is this beautiful little sequence, which I...
It's behind the paywall.
Which I highly recommend that you watch, right?
Not behind the paywall enough!
Which is how to recognize a narcissistic abuser, right?
With a little checklist, right?
Yeah.
It's like, his trauma is always more important than yours.
He negs you.
He gaslights you.
One of them on there is, never date comedians ever guilty until presumed innocent, which
is really, really fucking funny.
I don't want to, like, establish it as a principle, but, like...
Yeah, I mean, the movie's not wrong, but, like, often, comedians are, like, very insecure
and neurotic people.
It's not a new observation, right?
And so they go to the Ace Chemicals factory, which, again, if you know your Batman, you'll
know that's where the Jack Nicholson Joker was made into the Joker.
Yes.
He fell into the Jokerification serum.
This bit is done with fucked up Barbie dolls and action figures, which I really love.
It's a nice touch to do it with, like, literal, you know, without genitals Barbie dolls.
And then she jumps into a vat of Joker chemicals, which is just estrogen.
Yeah, and it says estrogen concentrate on the outside as well.
So, again, we're making it, like, very, very forthright.
I love this.
And as this is happening, who appears but Batman?
Out of retirement.
Batman himself.
And who knows Jason by name, and who calls him by name.
And, again, like, I'm not sure why I keep pulling this as a kind of acting that I find
notable, but immediately shifting into the most traumatized person in the world mode.
Because they escape from Batman.
And the other funny thing is that the estrogen is instant, and Joker is now, like, full, like,
tits, hips, clear skin, all the rest of it.
Yeah, I wonder how they shot this.
Because is the actor who played Joker up to this point Vera Drew?
I believe so, yeah.
I think it's just, like, a lot of, like, makeup and, like, binding even.
I don't know.
But, like...
Yeah, I mean, I would have guessed that needed to happen.
Yeah, but...
I'd be interested to know how they come.
Fantastic.
Just a really incredible job.
It's a really good performance.
And you don't often see trans actors don't often get to do that, to play ourselves on
both sides of the transition.
It really works.
It's really good.
Yeah.
But so, as Joker is trying to process all of this, Jason is just in pieces, right?
And Joker is trying to comfort him.
And he explains what the deal with Batman is, right?
We get a little nicely animated backstory.
Yeah.
By the way, all the bits that are animated are animated in a different style.
It's by presumably different people.
It's so good.
Jason was this orphan who was adopted, made the ward of Batman in order to become Robin.
This is, like, this is shown exactly as predatory as, you know, it sounds, right?
And was, at the time, believed to be a girl.
Yeah, and was Robin for a number of years.
And, again, this is a pretty common experience for a lot of trans people of, like,
when Jason transitions, when he comes out to Batman, like I say, common experience,
Batman is, like, completely supportive.
He seems like, you know, he's good about it.
He's, like, he seems excited even.
He, like, pays for the transition and everything.
And then fucking tries to fucking abuse him, right?
Yeah.
Tries it all.
He makes a pass to him.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Someone who's basically his dad.
One of the lines is, I found out I wasn't one of the only Robins.
I walked on him and teaching a kid Kung Fu.
Couldn't have been older than 14.
Yeah.
There's also this, well, so Bruce tries to assault Jason, then makes him sign an NDA.
Mr. J ended up leaving and becoming the Joker.
Yeah, going underground, becoming the Joker.
So, we also get this really nice line where he says,
child services said it was grooming?
Question mark.
And I thought that was a really nice illustration of the way that, like,
Gotham Child Mental Health Services obviously did not understand that this child is trans
and quickly reached for the narrative that he's been groomed into this.
I thought that was a really nice, like, not only did things go wrong with my carer,
but also I was let down by the services that are supposed to protect me in that scenario.
Yeah, because it, like, in the sense of it is grooming, but not in the way that they think that it is.
Yeah.
It was sexual grooming, but not gender identity grooming.
Yes, yeah.
But yeah.
And also, like, Jason is gay as well, so it wasn't even, like, grooming him into being gay.
But, like, anyway.
And also from this, we learn that Batman is a closeted gay man.
Yes.
Because we've seen a couple of, like, TV ads where Batman's going to go on The Bachelor
and he'll just be like, no man who's completely heterosexual like me could resist these beautiful women.
It's like, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Thus, ostensibly the NDA, right?
Because what would Gotham think?
Yeah, definitely.
Their relationship continues, Jokers and Jason Todd's, and we see it take pretty quickly a much nastier and more abusive tone, right?
Mm-hmm.
With, like, a literal gaslight is involved.
Yes.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He sees Batman on, like, the TV a little too often and just, like, shoots Vitelli.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And she's like, what the fuck are you doing?
Which is, it's a legit, it's like a legitimate trauma.
It's a legitimate trigger, right?
And the thing is that, like, his trauma always matters more.
One of the things he, like, gaslights Joker into saying is, I have PTSD.
And then when Joker says it literally back, I have PTSD.
It's like, no, no, no, no, that's right.
I have PTSD.
And it's like, that's such an insightful view of, like, how, like, a lot of people behave.
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
He uses a literal, like, hypnotic gaslight.
Yes, yeah.
And then, and then, because even more fucked up, he says, now we're going to bed.
Mm-hmm.
Which is like, ooh.
Gross, yeah.
Gross.
And also, he deadnames her.
Yeah, deadnames.
This is the only time, there are two times, this is the only time someone else says the
deadname and it isn't bleeped.
Just so that you, like, know exactly what's just happened there.
Yeah, and it feels like getting punched in the face.
Like, I...
It does.
It's so brutal.
It's such a nice choice, actually, because it, because it's not bleeped, it blends into
the surrounding words more, but for that reason, it's...
It's like, trip over it and you come back and you're like, what?
It's such an impact.
It's almost more shocking as you process what you've just heard.
It's like, oh my God, like...
It feels like getting deadnamed, like, aggressively feels.
Yeah.
Which...
It's really, really good.
It takes a trans filmmaker to make that and it takes an unusually talented trans filmmaker
to capture that feeling exactly.
Yeah.
And it's like, no, that should be bleeped.
You should not have that.
Like...
Yeah.
It's good.
Like, she says later on, it's like, he didn't even know me as that, so he only said that
to hurt me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like, so the argument goes, right, is that he shoots Vitelli and while she's telling
him off for this, like, her mum calls and, like, she just lets that play out and
goes off and he grabs onto that and is like, oh, well, at least you knew your mum.
Like, you're throwing this relationship away.
So it's, in a way, it's like, bigging up his own trauma and cutting hers down at the
same time.
And then, of course, he gets out a literal gaslight and it's like, she's just, like,
hypnotized by it.
It's like, oh yeah.
Your trauma is more important.
Yeah.
We get another scene of Penguin is the best guy ever because they have this conversation
about comedy and, like, where you want it to be when you grew up and, like...
I have the drop, right?
And this is, this is a...
They put me in the movie.
This is audio of my last two brain cells fighting.
Why did you want to be a cop?
I just...
I wanted to help people, not just be some fat comedian in a bandit warehouse.
And as a fat comedian who wanted to be a cop, that, yeah, that hits, you know?
But we get this nice moment where Penguin says, what did you want to be when you go,
but she's like, I wanted to be a Harlequin.
And he goes, hey, you did it.
Like, Penguin is a trans ally.
Yeah.
Penguin's so good, man.
Penguin's great.
She's like, yeah, I think I have a plan, actually.
So she goes home to put the plan in place, but her mom is at home.
Okay, surprise.
Yeah, this is also very familiar to me, is the process of, like, a parent who is getting
better, who has, like, been working on themselves, has been to therapy.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Yeah.
Who is trying.
Who is trying.
Who is trying.
And who means it quite sincerely.
Who is trying, but is also quite trying.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And the kind of exhausting prospect of your mom who, like, believes you to be gay and is
just, like, being supportive of that and that being a step for her, being like, I am proud
of my gay son.
Like, thank you.
A little bit more to go.
We see where the line is, too, because she calls her by her dead name.
And then she says, by the way, I've changed my name now.
People are calling me Joker.
And that, interestingly, is the line where her mom's just like, but I gave you that name.
Like, what's wrong with it?
Is it not good enough for you?
That is extremely fucking familiar to me because that was a thing with my family for a while
is that they were fine about quite a lot of changes.
But then I was just like, I offered my family the chance to rename me.
And they refused.
They were like, no, we want you to keep the name we gave you.
And I was like, obviously, I can't do that.
So, yeah, that, interestingly, was the line.
It was the name in particular.
Very astute.
I really had to fight to get my name with my family for a little while there.
Like, they're fantastic about it now.
Like, they basically don't remember what I used to be called.
But, like, at the start, it was a real push to get them to stop.
They started just calling me D.
There was, like, one holiday I went on where I was trying to force this down.
And they just, like, were calling me D instead, really awkwardly.
And I'm like, motherfucker, you're already saying a different word.
Just do the one I want.
I mean, I was D for, like, a long time in part to, like, ease my parents into it.
Right?
Like...
I swear to God, I go back and listen to all the episodes sometimes.
So when you introduce yourself as D, I'm like, oh!
Yeah, no, genuinely.
Fuck, fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Yeah.
Because she's trying, her mum wants to come and see her anti-comedy and meet the guy that
Joker is dating, Jason.
And so she sits through this very primly, where she does the, like, saddest story you've ever
heard bit, which, again, is fucking hilarious.
It's a great book.
Yeah.
And Joker hacks Batman's drones.
And they do a pirate broadcast.
They make fun of Bruce Wayne.
And she demands to host UCB Live tomorrow instead of Batman.
Yeah.
She's like, I want to do it.
Lorne Michaels, let me do this.
Uh-huh.
Can someone explain to me who Lorne Michaels is?
I believe he's some sort of golem.
Yeah, he's the, like, godfather of Saturday Night Live, right?
And he's not funny, but he controls what is officially allowed to be funny.
And, like, kind of late night comedy.
He looks exactly like that, like, 3D model.
Like, Abby, if you look this up, he's going to look way more like the 3D model than you're
expecting him to.
Yeah.
He appears in this film as a kind of, like, metaverse android.
Just fucking guy.
Oh, wow, he does.
He does kind of.
Wow.
Yeah, no.
Yeah.
I'm not entirely sure why he has the, like, career position that he does, but he does.
And so, like, comedy runs through him.
But so, yeah, she puts out this communique.
And after the show, Jason's smoking outside while Joker and her mom are talking.
And it's very, very awkward, right?
Yeah.
And she's like, I just don't think that I can support what you're doing because it's illegal.
You're going to get in trouble.
We've seen, by the way, that the punishment for, like, illegal comedy is summary execution.
And one of the fucking bat drones falls out of the sky and, like, lands on Joker's mom, concussing her.
Bonks her on her head.
Yeah.
Knocks her out.
Just before this, she says, you used to be so happy.
And Joker says, I've never been happy.
Yeah.
And this pirate broadcast inspires a wave of anarchic clown crime across Gotham, including copyright infringement.
Yeah.
Indeed.
Which is quite funny.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
So we go to the hospital.
Yeah.
And once again, Jason Todd, such a believable abusive partner here.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Like, for one thing, he steals her fucking medication.
He takes the, like, Smilex from her.
Mm-hmm.
Which is added to the list of, like, signs of a narcissistic abuse at number six after don't date
comedians ever is he steals your medication.
Mm-hmm.
He just leaves.
He's just like, I'll be outside because it's not about him.
So he can't, you know.
Yeah.
He's not happy there.
And her mum wakes up and they have this conversation where her mum says, do you really feel that
you've never been happy?
Mm-hmm.
Ever?
Like, not one?
You don't have one happy memory?
Happy memory all the time.
She says, yeah, I really do.
I really do feel that.
And her mum says, me too.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Which is, like, really poignant and beautiful.
Beautiful.
And, like, well-observed and well-written.
Mm-hmm.
It's just this really nice moment.
We're not yet at the final reconciliation between these two characters, but just the
way this whole arc is written is really, like, fantastic.
Yeah.
So as she's leaving the hospital, she gets a phone call from Lorne Michaels to say, you
know what?
We actually love diversity.
And we're putting together...
This is fucking incredible.
An all-new, diverse cast.
Mm-hmm.
And he pauses for just long enough for her to realize that she's supposed to be like,
oh, congr...
Well done.
Yeah, I love that!
It's really good.
We're putting together a diverse cast.
Oh, so...
Congratulations.
It's, like, so good.
Fucking brilliant.
And he wants her to be on it, right?
Yeah, if you want to host UCB Live, to her.
She gets to be on UCB.
Yeah.
And, of course, she, like, says, like, sort of a heavily weighted towards yes answer.
Mm-hmm.
Goes outside and meets Jason again.
Mm-hmm.
Who tries the same thing and, like, with more, like, desperation, right?
And they have this argument, right, that culminates in Jason sort of, like, trying to, like, grab
her wrist and saying, like, I love you, you know, and please don't leave me.
And she does, you know?
She manages to do it, right?
And she kind of breaks free of him both physically and, like, metaphorically.
Yeah.
Nicely staged.
Nicely done.
Once you get a certain way along in your transition, you realize you don't need that person anymore.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And you're doing her identity on your own.
And it's something that we later find out.
It's something that Jason tries to, like, hold over her as well.
It's like, you need me.
Like, you needed me to do this.
You needed me to transition.
You would never have, like, been able to do this without me, right?
Mm-hmm.
And, yeah.
And, like, whilst that might be true to an extent, like, it's clear now that she can fly solo.
Exactly.
Do it all right.
Exactly.
But she goes back to the theater and she has this argument with Penguin.
Because the theater's been destroyed by Batman and the cops.
Yes.
You know, the GCPD have, like, bust up the place in Retribution.
And they have this argument that, again, is like fucking two brain cells banging off the inside of my head.
Right?
Because she wants to take the thing.
Yeah.
She's like, I'm gonna take the job.
I'm gonna host it.
Yeah.
Think about all the queer kids who finally get to watch a trans woman on a comedy show.
Oh, that makes you a hero.
What if it does, you prick?
Then it makes you the hero Gotham deserves.
A selfish, stupid, asshole hero.
You know, because you're...
Yeah.
Because you said you made your whole fucking persona being against this.
And then the second you get a crumb of, like, validation from it, you're right back in there.
Yeah.
You're a fraud.
You're a phony.
He's spitting.
He's spitting pure fact here.
Is he?
Yeah.
This is my last two brain cells fucking arguing with each other all the time.
Yeah.
I think he is.
I mean, I don't know.
I...
It...
I like that the film doesn't really take a side on this.
It feels like a real argument between friends that could happen and they both can't have good points.
Yeah, absolutely.
She does go on the show and it goes well.
So, like, it's not like the film is even taking his side particularly.
It's just like, this is one of the opinions that you will face doing this.
It's an entirely, like, justified criticism.
And as someone who does comedy as a trans person, right, like, feeling like it's, like, not really useful to anyone.
Like, people sometimes tell me it is, but I don't really ever believe it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It absolutely, absolutely hits, you know?
Yeah.
I have this argument with myself about every fucking thing I do.
Like, I remember having this fucking discussion with myself as I was, like, getting ready to, like, go to the Emmys and shit.
I was like, what the fuck am I doing?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
I remember it was in one of your speeches at Transpride one time.
Yeah.
And, again, to steal from the comics with the hero Gotham deserves, right?
I really, really like that.
You know?
Yeah.
It's nice.
You get the community representation that you kind of, like, force people into, I guess.
Then we get the second time in the film where the dead name is not bleeped.
Which I fucking loved because she goes to UCB and the automated system does not recognize that she's a woman, does not recognize her new name.
And it's not until she just says her dead name that it goes, accept it.
Like, instantly lets her in.
And it does it instantly as well, yeah.
Like, immediately.
We get this journey now because she says it and it doesn't seem like it's, it just seems like it's like a pain in her ass to say it.
And we get this moment of, like, okay, the dead naming used to be, like, a really big thing that, like, pisses you off.
But now you've kind of advanced enough in your gender journey that it's, like, you're able to say it when you need to without breaking down crying.
But it's still fucking annoying.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I loved this.
And so she meets Ra's al Ghul again, who is going to mentor her in the art of comedy.
And she says, well, you could, I couldn't even pass yes and.
And he tells her, like, comedy is about, like, authenticity.
It's about, like, knowing who you are.
It's about, like, telling the truth.
How can you tell the truth if you don't have an identity?
Right.
Yeah.
And he also says that, like, comedy has been claimed by corporate people like Batman and Lorne Michaels.
You've got to reclaim comedy for the people by becoming the legendary prophesized people's Joker.
People's Joker.
I also think there's a thing that I really like here as well, because we've seen that Joker is, like, she's transitioned.
She's been on hormones, like, the, you know, vat of hormones for a while.
She's changed.
She was in the hormone vat.
Her ID and everything.
And she's still having this identity crisis.
And I like that.
I think this is something that I mentioned this in, and I saw the TV glow as well, is that, like, you know, transitioning is, like, the beginning of something.
And you can still feel this kind of dissociation.
And what Rach tells her is that failure to settle is the sign of a greater path, which is, like, such Yoda bullshit, but it's also true, right?
Yeah.
And he passes on, he's like, Lorne Michaels said, by the way, like, you can't do, you can't take drugs on stage.
You can't do that bit.
And you can't wear drag.
You can't wear drag.
And you can't wear drag.
You can't wear drag.
And she goes, well, you know it's not drag.
These are my clothes.
Right?
And he goes, I know I tried to explain that to him, but he doesn't get it.
And she's like, that's my whole fucking act.
And they have a slight argument about this, where he's just, she's yelling at him and he's going, look, like, I just said this to you.
I'm just telling you it, you don't have to do it.
And she goes, do you think the fucking people's, like, would the people's Joker, would he do it?
And he goes, you know what?
I think she wouldn't.
And it's like, yeah, man, let's go.
It's really good.
She also does the, like, sort of mystical, like, Star Wars cave thing, right?
It's from Batman Begins.
Very funny.
The little blue flower.
Yeah, she's got, like, a veil on and all.
Yeah.
Just on a spirit journey.
Yeah, you do some hallucinogens and then you, like, process some of the stuff.
And one of the ways in which she does this is she sees Dr. Crane again.
And, like, escapes from him.
But also her mum, right, who says, and I think this is really, really perceptive, right,
that she knew that she was a little girl.
I was protecting you from growing up into a trapped, miserable woman because I know what that feels like.
It's like, Jesus fucking Christ.
This was fucking beautiful.
And so true to life.
And, like, yeah, I was destroyed by that.
It was a beautiful piece of writing.
Yeah, absolutely.
Trauma is like mitochondrial DNA.
It advances up the female line.
Yeah.
So, having resolved to not obey the censorship rules, she clowns up, she does the dancing on the Joker,
she does the Joker standing on the steps dance.
Yeah, this rules every time.
Yeah.
From the Wacky Phoenix Joker.
Pretty good.
Nip slip, which is very funny.
And as she's about to, like, head to the studio, Batman appears.
Fucking bat.
Yeah.
He's mad because his slot of hosting UCB has been bumped.
And this was always his, like, fondest dream.
And she's rescued by Jason, right?
I love that Batman, we haven't actually talked about the way Batman is portrayed in this film.
He's not portrayed by an actor, he's portrayed by sometimes a Batman doll and sometimes, like, a deliberately, like, MS paint animated character.
He looks shit.
Yeah.
And also, the way that he is voiced is really, really flat.
God, I really hope this was a deliberate decision by the actor, otherwise this is going to appear really mean.
I think so, yeah.
He's just like, no one takes my slot hosting UCB from me.
And I love the way that he is this, like, flat.
No passion.
Yeah.
No, he's just, like, this deadened, closeted, stand-in, like, figure.
The movie has a lot of contempt for Batman, which I like.
It's entirely appropriate for a Joker movie.
Yeah, I really like it.
So he's chasing them down.
And we see that, like, this kind of, like, fucking staircase, like, of abuse of, like, Joker is terrified of Jason.
Jason is terrified of Batman.
But Jason is trying to, like, this is where he does the, like, you could never transition without me thing.
Right.
And Joker has the confidence to, like, push back on that now and say, well, okay, maybe.
But, like, it doesn't matter.
Like, I have now.
And she says, like, of course I fell in love with the most traumatized boy on the planet.
Right.
I think that reflects a real, like, ah, this movie really does get into, like, T for T.
Right.
Like, and as someone who's, like, dated a lot of other trans people, I think this is something that's, like, deeply relatable.
Both in the sense of, like, oh, I have run into people who are abusive exactly like this.
But also in, like, a lot of ways, like, short of being abusive, the ways in which you can be in a bad relationship or you can be, like, a bad partner in a relationship.
And the fact that you're together because you both have, like, infinity trauma, a lot of it based around being trans.
Right.
Yeah.
And then she literally looks directly at the camera and goes, just to remind the kids, this is not romantic.
It's not, no.
And I will show you a checklist again if I have to.
Like, this is really driving the point home here.
Mm-hmm.
Absolutely.
But it's not romantic, but it is explicable.
Right.
Exactly.
Yes.
A hundred percent.
Yeah.
And I think that's really, really interesting.
It's a really interesting thing to do with a character who is abusive like that.
Right.
And I think there are some broader points about, like, T for T stuff that I'll get into.
They crash into the river and in the park, Batman confronts them.
And the other villains slash comedians come to their aid.
So Poison Ivy's here, Catwoman's here, Penguin's here.
It's the kind of pain by numbers bit of the found family, the chosen family, like, band together to defeat the thing.
And the movie's heart's not really in that as well.
Like, it even hand waves this at the beginning when we meet the guys and it's, for the first time, it's like, listen, it's a coming of age queer movie.
Of course, there's going to be a chosen family.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
What's interesting about this, though, is when Joker fights Batman, he pulls the, at least your mum's still alive thing on her.
Mm-hmm.
And she goes, oh, that's where Jason got that from.
And that experience of meeting your abuser's abuser, your grand abuser, if you will.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Fascinating inside that.
Yeah.
Like, oh, wow.
Just to be like, oh, wait a second, this woman fucking didn't invent this?
It's like meeting a vampire's sire or something.
Yeah, exactly.
Exactly.
Dracula's ex-girlfriend, 2024.
It's on Nebula.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's just, it's really insightful.
It's very insightful.
This is the one moment of the film where I think the kind of like scrappy animated bit kind of lets it down.
Because the fight they have in the Belfry from the Michael Keaton Batman film, it's scrappily animated.
This is the one, one bit where I would have liked to see, I know it was done during COVID, I would have liked to see this done for realsies.
Mm-hmm.
Because it just detracts a little bit from the drama of it for me.
Sure, yeah.
This is the only moment where I was like, oh, it's a shame they didn't have all the budget they wanted.
But yeah, fair enough.
I'm willing to pay that price.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
So Batman is dropped off the tower and is eaten by a poison ivy plant.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
And Joker and Jason Todd don't reconcile, but do come to this place of like understanding each other a bit more.
Right?
And it kind of, I can relate to this too, right?
From like relationships before where I'm like, okay, this isn't like a happy ending here.
The happy ending is you leave each other alone.
Right?
Like, and the thing itself can have been a happy beginning, maybe.
And it just, I don't know.
This thing of, and this will feed into like the big sort of climactic thing that Joker says on stage at UCB.
It's like, yeah, sometimes people can behave fucking horribly.
And, and like, sometimes what you need out of that is to like understand where it comes from and not fucking do the thing again.
And it's, it's interesting because like you always hope that the person who, who does that is going to have the insight to be able to do that.
And, you know, maybe they let you down, maybe they don't, but it's, it's like, I don't know.
I think this is the bit that's like not romanticized, but like aspirational, I guess, you know?
Yeah.
A hundred percent.
So now we've come full circle and Joker is in the green room at UCB smoking trans sexually about to go out and host UCB Live.
In the red Joker suit.
Yeah.
She grimaces at the kind of diverse marketing that they do now.
She throws her smilex away and she goes out on stage.
She changes out of the red Joker suit into Harley Quinn fit, which looks incredible.
Yeah.
She looks real good at that.
Yeah.
And she tries to, she tries to do some bits and she's getting a huge laugh every time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then she tries some like worse bits.
Wow.
Huge laugh every time.
And then realizes that the reason why the live comedy audience is laughing so hard is because
Lorne Michaels is having smilex pumped in through the floor.
Mm-hmm.
Which I like.
And so she, she decides to tell the truth.
She says, Lorne Michaels wanted me to come out here dressed as a man.
Um, I'm not a hero or a villain.
Life's not a comic book movie.
Comedians aren't moral guides.
And now I'm going to tell you the saddest story ever.
And she tells Batman's story and like just pisses herself laughing at it.
But like.
Yeah.
Mainlining the gas that's being pumped in.
She says, we're all capable of being heroes and villains at any given moment, depending
on what we decide to show up as.
And I think that is, that is really good advice for trans people.
Right.
Uh, especially given that like, as we've talked about, we've all got like hella trauma.
Mm-hmm.
Is, yeah, this isn't some like category of person.
Even abuser isn't like a sort of fixed category of person necessarily.
It's, it's about like patterns and it's about behavior.
Right.
Uh, it's no one's like intrinsically good or evil.
And it's about how people are choosing to act.
And I think that's, that's really like.
Yes.
I don't know.
Uh, I really appreciate that.
I guess.
Uh, Lorne Michael slips on a banana peel, falls out of his clothes and dies.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I, I really like a childish, a childish revenge.
That was a great way of wrapping up what happened to that character.
It's like, fuck it.
Who cares?
You slipped on a banana peel and died.
It doesn't matter.
It's just like the hand wavy shit.
Cause like every, every frame is so deep with jokes, but some of them are just clearly just
like, ah, fuck it, whatever.
Cause like the, the all new diverse cast that gets introduced, it's just like David Spade,
Rudolf Hess, Herman Goering, David Spade.
And it's really good.
Like just.
Yeah.
But it's just like the contempt that this movie has for Batman is, is, is best reflected
in, in the joke about him, which is he couldn't face the truth about who he really
was.
So he stayed up all night, dressed up like a goddamn bat.
It's, it's hysterically fucking weird.
It's hysterical.
Yeah.
And then she does so much of the gas that she pops and explodes.
She explodes.
Yeah.
Yes.
Into a kind of like, into the multiverse.
Right.
Yeah.
Seeing all the, all the possible jokers that there could have been.
Yeah.
Oh, by the way, we'd also see when, when she's on stage performing, as far as like, you know,
trans kids watching this, uh, we see her as a little girl watching it.
Yeah.
And I, I just, I really liked that.
You know, I think that is the movie putting its thumb on the scale of like, yeah, this
is valuable.
Right.
Yeah.
Definitely.
But yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's true.
Yeah.
So we get a sort of hallucinatory sequence where she crashes through the multiverse battles
and like various hallucinations.
And then she wakes up in the fifth dimension with, uh, Mix Mixelplitz.
That's really funny because Mr. Mixelplitz is a Superman villain from the fifth dimension.
So it's really funny.
Yeah.
Really, really good.
Nice.
Good.
And she says, well, you know, I've got fifth dimensional powers.
I can change time.
I can do anything.
Basically just like magic genie.
So this is our deus ex machina.
Yeah.
And she says, can you clean up my timeline?
And so, uh, they do.
She sings, sings a song.
It's really fucking sweet.
Actually.
It's really nice.
There are a lot of little musical stings in this and they're all very hot.
Yeah.
So using the magic of Mix Mixelplitz, uh, they make Gotham a nice place.
It's like a walkable eco-friendly city.
They make Arkham into a fucking gender affirming healthcare center, which I love.
Penguin becomes the new Batman.
This bit, this bit is really fascinating to me for like a couple of reasons.
One is that it's funny.
Right.
And it's absurd.
The other is like, uh, you know, maybe I'm, I'm sort of thinking wishfully about this,
but for a movie that says correctly, a cab.
Right.
And so it's like, yeah, he does say he wants to be a cop and he becomes Batman.
Like that is, I think the position that this movie is taking, if I, not to read too much
into it is that if there's anybody who should be Batman, right.
Or should be a cop or should have that like function.
It's somebody who wants to do it to help people.
And there's this weird fucking outcast.
Right.
Get comedians to do it, I guess.
Yes.
Finally.
We'll reassign all comedians as cops.
So on that basis, I'm going to begin.
I've been trying this for a while.
It's a controversial thing to say the least.
It takes some real ground effort.
Don't worry.
We'll get there.
Joker's School for Transsexual Clown Youth of America.
Yeah, but like crucially, it's because you don't want to become a cop because a cop is
a thing that exists and sucks.
You want to become Batman, who is a thing that doesn't exist and can therefore not suck.
Yes, exactly.
Yes.
Yeah.
Let's not forget that this has been magicked into existence by a machina here.
You're imagining something different from the police, right?
You're imagining, you're doing police Batmanification, essentially.
Yeah.
And yeah, sure.
Absolutely.
Right.
Because like, if you want to do this, it's not about being a cop.
It's about the like, helping, pretty beautiful, self-protection.
It's about helping community, yeah.
Yeah, exactly.
Absolutely.
And I like the back win outfit too.
It's very funny.
It's also really funny.
It's cool that he's got the abs.
With his fucking big abs.
Really good stuff.
When he realizes that he has been made Batman, he just says, that bitch, which I really like,
like, admiringly.
So there's just enough power left for Joker herself to have a wish.
And she says, well, I don't want to be a jokeman.
I don't even want to be sis.
She says, I wish for just one happy childhood memory, which is beautiful.
Yeah, it's her and her mom in the car listening to The Joker.
By Steve Miliband.
Yeah.
Steve Miliband, not Steve Miliband.
And her mom hurriedly singing over the line Midnight Toker, because she doesn't want to
know what we did.
But also, what's really nice is Mix Mix Up says, I don't need to use my magic.
You've already got one.
Remember this?
Yeah, she just pinpoints the time.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
And then they finally end on this, like, slightly, this, this, well, I think the movie has earned
this slightly cheesy note.
We deserve our corny bullshit.
We deserve our roses.
Yeah, we do.
She says, they do the ending of Willy Wonka, where she says, don't forget what happened
to the boy who got everything he ever wanted.
What?
She lived happily ever after.
Fantastic.
Kazam.
Fantastic.
Just gray stuff all around.
Get some more back win in the credits.
Oh, the credits song?
Done by Nat Puff as well.
Left at London.
All the music in this is fantastic.
It's just such a love letter.
Every single one knocks it out of the fucking heart.
That's because it's all parodies of existing licensed songs apart from, I think, this one
and maybe some of the others.
More than anything else, it's just incredible to imagine someone getting this many artists
to fucking reply to them.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Viridru has the real trans super power, which is sending emails.
Yeah.
Like, ability to coordinate tasks and then follow through on those tasks.
I was still in the closet when this film was being made, and I fucking wish that
I had not been so that I could be part of it.
Mad as hell.
Yeah.
Call me back for People's Joker 2 Foley, I do.
If any of you fuckers are making a People's Joker right now, I'll help out.
I got nothing else going on.
I admire this film so much.
And like, you know how, Abby, when we did I Saw the TV Glow, you're like, I want to
work with Jane Chernobyl and I want to be in whatever they do next.
I feel that way about Viridru.
I'm like, I want to help.
I want to be in something.
I want to do something.
Whatever you're doing, hit me up.
I am fucking available.
It is firmly, like, stimulating the, like, creative urge, right?
Not just, like, and not just in the sense of, like, I want to work with this person,
but in the sense of, like, I want to fucking make something this good, right?
Yeah.
It was very inspiring and very refreshing.
Like, when I finished it, I've been working on a screenplay recently and I've been down
on myself, like, oh, it's not working.
It's not going anywhere.
And then as soon as I finished watching this film, I was like, no, fuck it.
Actually, I'm going to go and sit down and write a bit more of that.
And did.
Hell yeah.
Yeah.
It was inspiring.
But like, yes, absolutely.
Viridru, get in touch.
I will give you my manager's email, brackets positive, not give you my manager's email,
brackets just go straight to spam.
I mean, I will give you my real manager's real email.
I just, every time I see this movie, right?
I kind of, I cry buckets and I like dissociate for about two days in a positive way.
Yeah.
Like largely because they put me in the movie.
Right.
And, but also like it's so much of the like relationship dynamics, whether that's between
like Joker and her mom or Joker and Jason reflect stuff that like I've experienced, but also
like it's kind of reminded me that like heroes and villains, right.
It reminds me of like relationships I've been in where I've been a shitty girlfriend.
Right.
And been like, oh, wait a second.
I was kind of like completely absent and like passive because I was like terrified.
And that's not a good enough reason, you know?
So like being able to like grapple with that stuff and think, well, yeah, it doesn't like
that's, that's all in the mix of being trans.
Right.
I think it's really, really valuable.
And I think that like one of the really important things that this movie does is, is to kind
of like, it's only judgmental in the sense of like, do not date an abuser.
Here is how you recognize them.
Right.
It is not romantic.
It's not fun, which is a good thing to be judgmental about, but it's still, it has this
kind of like empathy and understanding for like, and that extends out to Penguin as well,
like fucking even to Batman, kind of right.
Even though he's like the worst person imaginable where it's, it's like, oh, this is, it's
all fucking like cycles of trauma or whatever, you know?
And I think that's, that's really like worthwhile, you know?
Yeah.
I don't know if we mentioned, but like when the, the memory, the one happy memory is playing,
like we see it being seen by the mother as well.
Like, yeah, it's a really nice little arc.
Like reconciling with your parents.
The idea that like reconciling with your parents isn't necessarily like.
It's cool to reconcile with your parents though.
Like I love that shit.
Yeah.
But also that it's, that it's not like a one and done thing that like.
Not at all.
And, and your parents can be like, I'm trying and still be, you know, kind of taxing.
And yeah, I, I just, I, I, there's so much here.
The idea that like transition is, is like still something that can leave you feeling, uh,
like bereft of identity, but in a new and better way is like, yeah, I, I just, I really,
really value this movie.
And I'm, I'm so glad that I got to talk about it with, with you guys because I, I think it
always helps me process a film.
I always think differently about a film after I've, after I've talked it over with you two.
Yeah, definitely.
Yeah.
I just, thank you so much.
Like, um, I feel kind of like, I don't know, emotional about this one.
So yeah.
Same.
Thank you so much for sharing this with me.
Thank you.
Like, you've shown me some movies that have really hit me over the, over the years.
You really like dropped some nukes on my position.
Yeah.
And this is another one of those.
It's so nice.
It's such a beautifully made movie.
Like the love is pouring out of it.
Like just wonderful.
I think in a, in a very real way, like this, this film made me feel less alone because I've
talked about this on the podcast before is that in the early stages of my transition,
I, I had, I had to do it alone because, uh, I didn't know you two wonderful people yet.
Um, I couldn't go to any in-person spaces or like digital spaces because they were all
full of people speculating.
The one trans person I knew just like completely left my life.
It was just like not dealing with this, deal with it on myself.
And so I, I did do it alone.
And like, I wrote the Prince, my play when I was largely still closeted and watching this
and I saw the TV glow has made me realize that like those, I saw the TV glow, people's
joke and the Prince are kind of the three examples of a very niche genre, which is movies
about being a closeted trans woman that are also love letters to the media.
We enjoyed as children.
And in this case, it's comic book movies.
In my case, it was like Shakespeare.
I want to see like 50 more examples.
I would love to see more examples every time.
Well, in that case is we've, we've got to make a fucking James Bond movie.
We do, but also like, yeah, but all like making the Prince was, was in some ways like
not the actual like making of a play, but writing it certainly was a very lonely experience.
And it made me feel like very isolated from people as did my coming out generally.
And then I watched this and I realized, oh, somebody else has made something, which is
like a better, but be like, I think it's a similar thing, but with a different kind of
medium.
Yeah.
It's, it's like the moment where like a hand reaches out from the cinema screen and grabs
yours.
It was beautiful.
I'm so grateful to Viridu for having made this.
It made me reach into my own past and make me in my bedroom in Essex, realizing I was
going to have to climb this mountain myself, feel retroactively less alone.
And that is beautiful.
And I'm so grateful for that.
Yeah.
Sort of baseline thing, right?
If you're trans, you have to live, right?
Next step up from that.
If you're trans, you have to create art.
You have to do it.
Like, remember when Jeremy Corbyn did the thing of like, I believe everyone has like
a, you know, a painting or a novel or whatever in them and got savaged by fucking Helen Lewis
being like, don't encourage them, Jeremy.
Fucking encourage them.
Encourage them, Jeremy.
It's good as fuck.
I want to see, I don't care if it's weird.
I don't care if it's bad.
I don't care if it's like fucking reprehensible.
If you are trans, make art because I want to see it.
I want to think about it.
I want to consume it.
I want it to be in my life.
Hell yeah.
Like, I'm putting my thumb very firmly on the scale here of being like, do something
creative because like anything that you do is going to be like this absolute beacon
for like other trans people.
And like, that's so valuable.
And creating fucking rules too.
Like just, it's really good to have a hobby that isn't watching things or like playing
things or like something that you're doing with your hands.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, absolutely.
Absolutely.
Do art.
Do some art.
I want to know what Vera Drew is working on now.
I'm like, okay, what's next?
Because it's the difficult follow-up.
I've also encountered this problem with Dracula's Ex-Girlfriend.
I'm just like, okay, made the prince, which is like a very personal thing about like transition
and it's a love letter to media and so on.
And like had a big effect on people.
What's the second album?
And like Dracula's Ex-Girlfriend was a tough one for that reason.
It was a tough follow-up act.
Third step on the staircase.
Continue to make art.
Yeah.
Yeah.
About other things now.
Yeah, exactly.
That's the other thing.
I want to see more trans things from more trans people at more stages of transition, you know?
Like we said, it's a beginning, right?
And yeah, I'm sort of like endlessly hopeful about that, you know?
Well.
That's it?
That's it.
That's the people's joker.
I really enjoyed it.
I managed not to like catastrophically overshare in this one, which I'm like proud of myself about.
Yeah.
Like I said, I feel differently about it.
I feel better about it for having talked it out with YouTube.
But I hope also people listening like get something from it.
And I highly recommend this one.
I really, really do.
Yeah.
A hundred percent.
A hundred percent.
Absolutely.
Go and like track this down, find it.
And yeah, it's mostly it's it's out in America.
Like you're going to struggle to find it if you're in the UK.
But thank you to this week's sponsor, which is of course Nord VPN.
Oh my God.
Okay.
So, so better help.
Right.
There is a lot.
Oh, fuck those guys.
Oh my God.
Cut to black.
There is a UK.
That's for mattresses.
Bring me back from cut back up from black to say that there is a UK screening of this.
The UK premiere in Glasgow, October 26th.
I think I already bought my ticket.
So I didn't like check, but like, yeah.
Be there and be queer.
You fucking losers.
Let's do this.
That's going to be so good.
It's probably what you want up to like a maximum of like eight quid.
And tickets are selling fast because it's like a, like an indie space.
So it's like a small cinema.
But like, yeah, if there are still tickets by the time this comes out, then absolutely go
and see it.
I would love to like screen this somewhere, you know?
In the meantime, thank you so much for listening.
And thank you so much for subscribing to the Patreon.
And our next mainline episode is going to be the second diabolic movie.
If we can find it.
Ginko attacks, baby.
Sure.
If we can find it, maybe we can hire diabolic brackets, ginko attacks brackets 2022.
Thank you so much for listening.
We will see you next time.
Bye, everyone.
Bye.
Bye, everyone.
Mwah.
Chaos podcasting.
Thank you for listening to yet another episode of Kill James Bond.
I'm making the executive decision at this point to stop saying what the episode next week and the week after is during the jazz outro,
because November always remembers to do it now.
And I need the time for names.
All right.
Now we're all in agreement here.
Just to keep the music.
I've got any people thinking that I need to put Rap God behind this nowadays, but I don't.
There's only 100 names to say.
I only need to say them in like two minutes.
All right.
50 names a minute.
It's fine.
Just a little over one a second.
All right.
It's doable.
Cheers for being a patron.
