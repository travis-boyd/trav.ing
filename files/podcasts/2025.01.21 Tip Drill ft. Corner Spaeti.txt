0.00 37.26 SPEAKER_03  I was hoping with the inauguration for a real like Tom Clancy's death of honor type situation or I guess alternatively like a you know a designated survivor situation where you know obviously like you know no more Trump no more Vance and it's the the guy who used to roll logs who Trump put in charge of the Department of Transportation he's president now and we just get like four years
37.26 56.68 SPEAKER_04  of log rolling check this out check this out Pete Hegseth is not showing up to the inauguration because he fell off the wagon in the limousine bar and then it's gonna be like Pete you have to be president you're never gonna be able to be president unless you can like defeat your drinking and then we get like gritty president not gritty as in the fucking hockey thing like a dark gritty president
56.68 61.12 SPEAKER_03  yeah it sets up like a redemption arc yeah yeah yeah you got like a kind of punished Hegseth
61.12 73.02 SPEAKER_02  yeah yeah I really like November's idea of the designated survivor who just does not meet the moment and just knows what they were doing beforehand like I'm the head of fisheries and every time they try to rebuild the country it's like all right but how are the fish doing
73.02 86.56 SPEAKER_04  my first love is the fish look I was born to be head of fisheries I was forced to be president I refuse to take on any more responsibilities the fish come first but I will use all the powers
86.56 90.52 SPEAKER_08  of the office of president to pursue Greg Stubbe for his crimes against the fish
90.52 116.28 SPEAKER_04  I mean oh god seeing the I would say a pretty carnival-esque atmosphere uh across the Atlantic right now the thing oh no no no no listener you don't you don't need to know anything about what Milo's referencing is I have seen no end this I try to think like what's the differences between
116.28 134.06 SPEAKER_03  Trump 2025 and Trump like toward 2016-17 he's gonna do way more of the Hitler stuff it seems like oh yeah like that's the main thing you know not to sort of detract from the vibe here but it really does seem like point one on the agenda is all the Hitler stuff uh way more than last time you know
134.06 152.04 SPEAKER_08  yeah I um I heard a British lib interviewed on the on the radio today and he said he's like yeah Trump is a disaster a lot of people are saying he's he's like American Hitler but he's actually like American Stalin and what he meant by that was worse than Hitler I don't think you've got the the
152.04 162.98 SPEAKER_04  the order of who's worse correct there or maybe he just meant like Trump is going to pursue a policy of capitalism in one country he's already disappeared Vivek you know there you go Trump's photoshopping
162.98 176.84 SPEAKER_05  people out Vivek was like hiding behind his massive son I still got on the team like I was at the gym and I was like where's like there's this like this little speck of like brown guy like behind it's like they they're so like that's the strategy that every time someone like fucks up we're just gonna
176.84 183.52 SPEAKER_04  hide him behind baron you disparaged white people get behind baron you want to be visible grow taller
183.52 188.82 SPEAKER_07  you want to be seen should have been a bigger guy the more nice stuff you say about white people
188.82 216.80 SPEAKER_04  Vivek the taller a stool will give you you must be at least this tool to govern one of the things is the difference is obviously we've sort of broached this in our discussion with Mike Isaac about a lot of the tech CEOs that are all queuing up to sort of you know kiss Trump's feet is that in 2016-17 the mono party and you know the mono party on both sides of the Atlantic as well had not lined up four square behind just him as normal and the stuff he wants to do as regular yeah yeah they were still
216.80 249.92 SPEAKER_03  outsiders and you know now that's very different in the sense that like you know JD Vance's wife is being dressed by Oscar de la Ranta you saw Trump kind of like making nice with Obama at like Carter's funeral and so I think like the kind of elite across both parties has made its accommodation and have just decided oh yeah this is normal which is not a great combination with all of Trump's people really deciding that what they need to do this term is make him lock in on the Hitler stuff instead of just being a kind of weird musical theater dilettante like he was last time yeah he never he didn't get
249.92 254.76 SPEAKER_04  anyone to play as in as inauguration last year last time last year last time this time he got his
254.76 266.76 SPEAKER_08  favorite band the village people yeah he got everything he wanted this chap saluted him yeah well there we go that's like a dream November would have I hate gay Hitler so much and like this
266.76 288.16 SPEAKER_03  like day one he's done this kind of like declaration of war on like trans people in general and it's so humiliating just like like adding insult to injury to be the victim of that at the hands of a guy who likes the village people and like musical theater this much and it's just kind of insulting you know
288.16 293.40 SPEAKER_05  Nelly and Snoop Dogg are playing at the inauguration cool oh hell yeah Nelly's gonna play like tip drill
293.40 314.24 SPEAKER_03  or something that's like this is the thing right because one of the other things about the the new Trump administration is I saw this in the financial times I saw like a senior banking executive get quoted as saying oh it's like you know it's like liberation basically because now we can say and
314.24 327.70 SPEAKER_09  then he said two slurs so hell yeah oh god sorry I'm just I'm too fixated on the idea of Trump doing like the this like little dance that he does to like the line yeah yeah he didn't really like do the
327.70 333.20 SPEAKER_03  whole thing he did a little bit of one like on the move when the guy salutes him um but yeah but
333.20 345.92 SPEAKER_09  like doing this to the line girl it must be your ass or no girl it might wait because it ain't your face I need a tip drill so like yeah yeah love it didn't he didn't he get like at his first
345.92 350.46 SPEAKER_02  inauguration didn't he get like three doors down thrust upon him like wasn't that the only band who
350.46 378.30 SPEAKER_03  would do it oh my god yeah glow up because that's that's not shit he likes like three doors down being foisted on him is like an insult that lives in Trump's brain on the on paracy with like Obama humiliating him at the correspondence dinner that made him want to be president in the first place like it's it's just like and so he's determined to recover from that by getting I guess the one remaining village person and three new village people imagine how happy he would be if he got the
378.30 383.44 SPEAKER_04  entire cast of the chorus line to perform the entire musical for his inauguration folks they
383.44 387.96 SPEAKER_07  brought the whole village out just for me something to look every single person for the third inauguration
387.96 424.32 SPEAKER_04  I guess yeah yeah and then she said she tried to melt just to see how an ice cream failed and I melted inside yeah that's a quote from the musical a chorus line uh anyway anyway look look look we have Nick and Kieran from Corner Spady here joining us we are going to in addition to talking of course about the inauguration of President Trump for his third term because he also won in 2020 this is actually his third term he was secretly governing in 2020 yeah that's right on that yeah yeah um for the the this next Trump inauguration we're also going to be turning our attention over to Europe something we've been meaning to do for a little while and look at all of the Euro Trumps that are appearing
424.32 441.12 SPEAKER_03  throughout the continent all the ways not here of course all the ways in which like uh Europe in particular but across the world people are trying to kind of grovel to Trump and control Trump and like offer Trump things that he likes Euro Trump is such a powerful idea we love to get up in the
441.12 447.24 SPEAKER_07  morning don't we folks yeah we love to have a glass of milk don't we maybe a cheese sandwich it's not
447.24 451.62 SPEAKER_02  it's not Trump unless it comes from the slur region of I'm gonna say Serbia I feel like slur would be
451.62 480.66 SPEAKER_04  a name of a place in Serbia yeah yeah yeah but before we get to Europe we I want to stick to the US for a little bit just because that's where the stuff is happening I noticed there was one sort of thought that I felt to be completely inescapable which is the self-congratulation of very rich people who are finally comfortable voting Republican because they have been able to what free themselves culturally from the shackles that like being a lib makes you a good person getting a divorce like yeah yeah
480.66 512.86 SPEAKER_03  America's entering its divorce era it's it's kind of like all of these guys are going well it was a rough four years of having to you know pretend that I liked my kids but now I can just kind of I can I can lock in on whatever the fuck I want which is pretending to be good at video games uh saying the words any number of like fun right-wing divorce dad activities every room a man cave we're going to make America into a reddit male living space yeah so for example one of the co-founders
512.86 527.14 SPEAKER_04  of Airbnb uh not Chesky the other one you know does it it I again I you know I don't like to do Twitter review unless it is very worth it uh has written I have a confession to make I did a bad thing something the younger me would hate myself for doing by the way this is all line breaks like it's a
527.14 531.42 SPEAKER_07  fucking like Shel Silverstein so he's actually doing I've got a confession to make
531.42 613.46 SPEAKER_04  something I voted Republican last November yeah so he says I'm late to the party on this but today we stop hiding the truth from our close never Trump or friends that we support a party that isn't going to run this country into a ground etc etc etc and then talking about how great RFK is how he's going to like you know free us from vaccines or whatever and the language that he uses and that then again all of the tech people coming out of the woodwork including a guy who started a company called like Blounts which makes like you know children's storybooks or whatever right like an Austrian right winger who's like yeah I founded Blounts which makes children's storybooks it's called Blunge excuse me and they're all talking nonsense words incorrectly they're all talking to each other as though they have just come out to their religious conservative parents and they have a chosen family of like reactionary billionaires it is the level of self-congratulation it's when you're using that language from the position of yeah I'm a billionaire and I'm tired of you oppressing me by uh by like you know your vague disapproval it feels so fucking whiny and I am I am compelled to say that all of the like junk bond touting corporate raider Reaganauts that like comprised a huge part of the GOP money base in the 1980s would never be caught fucking dead like oh you're being mean to me no that's not that's not
613.46 648.82 SPEAKER_03  the greed is good shit that that's not even where Donald Trump comes from you know and he's a very whiny man but he's whiny in a different way right he's bitchy I guess I guess the last ditch of kind of like any kind of anti-Trump or like anti-Republican thing right now is uh you can't like they can't make people not think that they're weird and annoying right uh and there's there's so long as there's some kind of vague personal disapproval all of these people are going to drive themselves insane over it and that's kind of nothing but you know it's still more effective opposition than the Democrats
648.82 668.20 SPEAKER_04  so so you know what we what we now have essentially right is a normalized and much more extreme Trump in the states declaring hit celebrating his inauguration by doing his little hand dance to YMCA announcing mass deportations announcing mass deportations ending birthright citizenship basically like declaring
668.20 684.64 SPEAKER_03  transgender people to be un-people well this is the deal right like TikTok back in they them pussy out they them dick out she her dick out he him pussy out you know I hope you're happy with that art of the deal America my for you screen decimated
684.64 693.50 SPEAKER_02  it's all just the village people now it's like it's the Twilight Zone episode of like there was time now
693.50 718.62 SPEAKER_08  before you screen actually I think though you know the US military for a long time has lacked a camp salute like the British military has so I would like to see Trump introduce the YMCA hand gesture as the new salute that's what they should do when they know when you meet each other in the corridor you gotta do the full oh right you gotta do it like quick and snappy in like a military way like I can click your heels together you know you gotta do it like the tomb of the unknown soldier guys
718.62 720.78 SPEAKER_04  and it's gotta be like a sort of respectful pop and lock
720.78 726.54 SPEAKER_02  we hit like ketamine yeah yeah yeah yeah you're wet properly this is my rank yeah they're playing YMCA
726.54 743.20 SPEAKER_01  Private your trousers are not assless where did you get these non-regulation asphalt trousers I can't see you hole corporal private hole your hole is not private your hole belongs to me and the US government
743.20 750.44 SPEAKER_04  but right what what he does he does this list of terrible things and then also does two crypto rug pulls simultaneously
750.44 757.00 SPEAKER_05  what do you call an act like that it's a hawk to a two to I'm trying ah
757.00 760.10 SPEAKER_04  hawk to a with a two instead of a two
760.10 763.58 SPEAKER_05  yeah yeah that's really good everyone please just tell me that was a good joke
763.58 766.64 SPEAKER_04  in all you know it was really good two hawk to two that's right
766.64 770.48 SPEAKER_05  uh eagle to a actually well she she ran so he could fly
770.48 779.36 SPEAKER_07  that's that's my main takeaway from all of this hawk to a I don't even need to spit on it they'll buy it anyway okay I'll do it dry and they'll still have it
779.36 828.22 SPEAKER_04  so all he took to truth social I love that he still posts on truth social he's like Elon's still not getting it yeah show me his unedited speed run maybe then but it says my new official Trump meme is here remember we talked about how he started world liberty financial or with like his son's sort of world liberty financial right and they were gonna be yeah it's gonna be the future of like decentralized finance the future of lending and then immediately like on his inauguration day releases a series of family themed coins all of which spike again when I say spike in value to like 60 billion dollars I don't really mean that they were ever worth 60 billion dollars and once again the financial illiteracy of our journalist classes is fully on display here as they're like wow he's he's now worth 60 billion dollars it's like that's just because there's no one buying or selling it almost
828.22 845.58 SPEAKER_03  it feels so surreal that this presidency that for all I know is gonna end in like nuclear exchange or Trump getting executed on the White House lawn by like the woke US military is beginning with the YMCA revival and crypto rug pulls
845.58 853.62 SPEAKER_08  it's like first is fuss and then is tragedy Biden and Trump having some like jewel of the fates shit on the White House lawn
853.62 856.34 SPEAKER_07  Biden being like there's one thing you forgot Mac
856.34 859.96 SPEAKER_08  and then opening his jacket in the suicide vest like oh I actually forgot too
859.96 865.58 SPEAKER_03  it's weird that Biden showed first reformed in the White House right before you left
865.58 876.94 SPEAKER_04  so of course the market obviously reacted instantaneously because if you're going to trade Solana memes then basically you just try to be the first into a thing and then sell it before it crashes
876.94 881.04 SPEAKER_03  it's a very quick it's like it's like an express kidnapping but for pyramid schemes
881.04 921.44 SPEAKER_04  yeah it's it's a very very it's like a drive-by Ponzi scheme a very fast pyramid yeah it's kind of like a stalagmite you know it's like really it's like what if the uh the Irish guys that built the pyramids what if they all had rocket boots essentially preach brother they say they say the Trump coin reached a market cap of 13.6 billion with its fully diluted valuation soaring to 67 billion and then all sorts of graphs of his net worth come out it's like wow he's worth like a like 70 billion dollars because 67 of it is in Trump coin you cannot something is not worth something if you can't sell all of it you can't sell all of it it's what worth that much it's worth how much you can sell it for which isn't 67 billion dollars
921.44 926.08 SPEAKER_03  that's a lot of that's a lot of big words to say that you're jealous of the most successful man in the world
926.08 930.46 SPEAKER_04  yeah that's true that's actually true that's thank you thank you for keeping me honest
930.46 939.20 SPEAKER_08  a cafe in Neukölln opens we're a no card we don't trust the banks we only take Trump coin you're still mad about that one place
939.20 941.80 SPEAKER_00  it's every place
941.80 954.04 SPEAKER_04  which place I'm curious was there Bar Keith Bar Keith and Schiller uh Schiller Promenade oh yeah wait is that the one that takes bitcoin or some shit yeah oh yeah they do a good Rattler though they make it fresh with actual lemon I like that place
954.04 963.60 SPEAKER_02  they're they're they're just tricking you like they're one of the places in Berlin that has those stickers that say like with the bitcoin symbol on it being like stop wars oh my fucking god
963.60 968.88 SPEAKER_04  somehow that's like that's the most coherent ideology you can expect in Germany I think
968.88 969.32 SPEAKER_00  yeah
969.32 974.76 SPEAKER_04  it's like the coexist uh bumper sticker but written with the symbols of different cryptocurrencies yes
974.76 975.58 SPEAKER_00  yeah
975.58 1001.04 SPEAKER_04  it's like like Cardano uh AVE polygon so this is uh British bitcoiner and podcast host Peter McCormack founder of what bitcoin did sharply criticized Trump's move saying trump coin is embarrassing this is the opposite of what people voted for it's like no it's not it's exactly what people voted for they voted for rug pulls in YMCA and unimaginable cruelty yeah this is from the crypto podcast this is a place of dignity
1001.04 1002.38 SPEAKER_02  trump coin is a fire
1002.38 1055.70 SPEAKER_04  and uh also you know the last thing because we're going to talk in more depth about the um the various crypto rug pulls on the bonus episode this week I've already spoken with TF crypto correspondent Molly White and I did get the date right this time as opposed to that last time I announced Kieran was coming on two weeks ago that's not the only rug pull where uh Ryan Fournier who I don't know if you know is like one of these like lower level MAGA people chair of students for Trump either launches or is handed a pile of a coin called TikTok because again meme coins work by just something it's literally the currency of attention right everyone's paying attention to TikTok so you buy a coin called TikTok because other people are paying attention to it and will buy it on the hopes they can offload it to someone else later it's like it's it is gamble it is gambling just with on attention handed a pile of TikTok coin or starts it which is made by the way on pump.fun uh which is okay
1055.70 1074.94 SPEAKER_08  oh oh oh I know the person who runs pump.fun I met him I met him at Christmas anyway and and his mother was like that is this a real job yeah he was like he seems to be making a lot of money but I don't understand
1074.94 1080.92 SPEAKER_04  yeah well the guy well anyway he was implicated in this in the launching of the TikTok coin
1080.92 1088.88 SPEAKER_08  nice enough yeah I'm sure he is. I wouldn't have pegged him as a crypto guy I feel like normally crypto guys you can really spot them you know they had they exude a vibe.
1088.88 1090.30 SPEAKER_08  it's normalization again
1090.30 1096.36 SPEAKER_04  yeah well he's a crypto picks and shovels guy because he doesn't do any of the coins he just makes the infrastructure for other people to make the coins
1096.36 1098.72 SPEAKER_02  yeah the gold rush you sell pump.fun
1098.72 1108.74 SPEAKER_03  yeah just a hundred years later you're like why is the main university here named pump.fun university and it's like oh there was a whole robber baron arc don't worry about it
1108.74 1122.36 SPEAKER_04  yeah I'm protesting the pump.fun wing of the library because of how many like degenerate gamblers it put into the poor house yeah Oxford University must rename the pump.fun biology laboratory
1122.36 1123.02 SPEAKER_00  yeah
1123.02 1152.38 SPEAKER_04  so anyway Ryan Fornia chair of students for Trump has this like huge pile of TikTok coin made on pump fun and then immediately when as soon as he sees the price go down he controls all the liquidity he just sells all of it which is like that's unethical if not downright illegal because but what happened is he said then no you don't understand I literally I thought the price was gonna go down so I sold all of this coin that I kind of made I don't know who wouldn't do that which is just saying no no no it was pumped so I dumped yeah it's a logical thing to do
1152.38 1154.46 SPEAKER_01  when you pump you have to dump
1154.46 1175.82 SPEAKER_05  when you pump that's the fun and then when the pump is over it's not fun anymore he's wearing like a sort of circular argument where it's just like these coins exist in order for you to do pump and dump schemes yeah and so doing anything other than that kind of runs counter to the objectives of these coins in the first place and therefore it's not illegal because you're doing the thing that it's designed to do it just looks illegal if you were doing it with an actual currency
1175.82 1182.10 SPEAKER_04  it is if you made the currency and hold all of the liquidity right or at least it's unethical
1182.10 1194.42 SPEAKER_05  I mean it does sort of feel like there's a very sort of thin line but again I go back to like walk to Iran so everyone else could fly and seemingly she was like ahead of her time in terms of like figuring out what the economy was going to look like for the next four years
1194.42 1202.76 SPEAKER_04  well I like also you did a pump and dump in your defense and his defense after is I was too stupid to realize I was engaged in a pump and dump scheme
1202.76 1204.04 SPEAKER_08  the Wayne Hennessy defense
1204.04 1210.66 SPEAKER_05  or the Alex Jones defense of like I ate too much chili and therefore it like messed with my cognitive sense of being
1210.66 1218.44 SPEAKER_02  is there a dump dot misery? that's me between 10 and 11 a.m.
1219.30 1224.34 SPEAKER_04  that's right the one time is impossible to work with but I want to begin to cross the Atlantic right
1224.34 1226.38 SPEAKER_03  yeah so do a lot of Americans I feel
1226.38 1245.50 SPEAKER_04  the UK side of the story of course is Labour, the Conservatives all arguing about Trump and should we accept Trump and everyone says well yes of course we should the only person who seems to be having a very difficult time with that over here is of course Peter Mandelson the man who has been given his dream job
1245.50 1278.36 SPEAKER_03  and I don't know why this was his dream job a British ambassador to the US like maybe he went there at one point and the ambassador's residence has like a really nice bathtub or something but like it's all he's wanted and he had to like claw and like scheme and plot to get this job and now he's gotten it and Trump hates him which is weird because you think they would bond over the mutual friendship with Jeffrey Epstein but instead yeah I don't know maybe their dicks touched once or something just had a bad vibe and a Jeffrey Epstein orgy just like yeah I don't like this guy
1278.36 1287.80 SPEAKER_06  yeah for many years I've been I've been climbing the buttery staircase of British politics in order to feed my Whataburger addiction finally my dream has come true
1287.80 1292.26 SPEAKER_04  yeah this is the only gay guy I don't like get him out of here I don't want him being ambassador
1292.26 1296.02 SPEAKER_07  we're gonna make him stand behind Barron no funny stuff
1296.02 1311.10 SPEAKER_04  we're gonna accept Peter Mandelson as ambassador from the United Kingdom but we're gonna be fucking with him constantly we're gonna be playing pranks on him we're gonna treat the UK embassy like it's the snooty frat house
1311.10 1330.50 SPEAKER_07  we're gonna put him in the YMCA but we're gonna give him a letter that's not in the acronym he's gonna be Q okay he's gonna have to go on stage and he's gotta figure out Q it's the hardest one to do you gotta do it in mid-air alright shall we see him try jump Mandy do it for me
1330.50 1338.10 SPEAKER_04  Peter Mandelson gets to be the ambassador to the US but he has to do the plot of The Running Man starring Arnold Schwarzenegger
1338.10 1367.48 SPEAKER_03  the really funny thing about this is that the previous ambassador for some reason Trump really liked her and she was she had this reputation as being like the Trump whisperer because like they got along quite well and it's not weirdly it's not difficult to get along with Trump for a certain kind of person you just have to find that person and that kind of person is now like a strategic national asset for every country in the world it's like we're going into the national oaf stockpile
1367.48 1377.22 SPEAKER_04  we need someone who's the perfect balance of like a kind of catty flatterer yeah yeah Alan Carr British ambassador to the US
1377.22 1378.04 SPEAKER_00  yeah
1378.04 1396.14 SPEAKER_04  and so you know it's like what we have done this is something you mentioned a few weeks ago when we were first talking about like the sort of UK between Europe and the US is we picked ourselves up by the lapels and chucked ourselves out of Europe hoping that there would just be a kind of warm Atlanticism for us to kind of you know just sink into
1396.14 1421.70 SPEAKER_03  yeah catch me catch me and and then it occurs to us that like Trump still kind of likes Elon Musk and Elon Musk has gotten like radicalized against Keir Starmer specifically so uh now now we have this idea that Trump's like well I hear that this guy's Hitler you know I hear that he's very unfair it's a free speech and I don't like him uh and it's just like okay well what a brilliant plan this was you know
1421.70 1434.94 SPEAKER_04  and the guy whose job is going to be trying to make the diplomatic relationship work well he's trying to make a big Q right now yeah if anything one of the only people in the world Trump dislikes more than like Keir Starmer
1434.94 1437.90 SPEAKER_07  the British love a Q he's gonna have a great day
1437.90 1451.44 SPEAKER_03  it's kind of his perfect starmer because he can't not put Mandelson in that job until Trump rejects him because of like weird Labour Party nepotism and internal politics so it's like he's he's a prisoner of all this in so many ways
1451.44 1457.36 SPEAKER_04  oh well we should make the the guy who eats the Chinese food the ambassador Big John we should make Big John
1457.36 1458.74 SPEAKER_08  Trump would respect Big John
1458.74 1467.78 SPEAKER_03  yeah he would he loves the big guy right and so consequently again the national strategic big guy stockpile has dwindled terribly
1468.32 1481.90 SPEAKER_07  this guy has got an incredible relationship with China he's got a he understands China and he says bye you see him everything he says bash I say hello he says bash I say bash bash great guy
1481.90 1484.54 SPEAKER_04  and we say bash bash and we say bash bash
1484.54 1489.58 SPEAKER_05  I'd love to see Trump on the Big John Chinese sit down I think it'd be like one of the most revealing things
1489.58 1494.86 SPEAKER_04  you know Kamala was invited to go on the Big John Chinese sit down and didn't actually go that's why she lost yeah
1494.86 1505.44 SPEAKER_08  she should have campaigned more in Romford she lost the blue orchid weirdly it's about seven electoral votes but it's perfect 50-50 swing yeah
1505.44 1514.24 SPEAKER_04  they uncovered a little bit of the constitution that said one patch of Romford that is now the blue orchid Chinese restaurant is technically a state
1514.24 1519.42 SPEAKER_08  it's all to do with the war of 1812 yeah we're all technically American citizens
1519.42 1541.56 SPEAKER_04  yeah sod that double tax though I'm paid in cash in hand yeah anyway I want to talk about Europe Kieran Nick what the fuck is going on in Europe and please please can you start by giving our listeners an update on the political future of Cypriot Mr. Beast yes
1541.56 1545.62 SPEAKER_09  yes my boy what's his name again Phidius I Phidius
1545.62 1600.08 SPEAKER_02  we love Phidius so Phidius is his political career is he's the first independent MEP from Cyprus a country that sends six people to the European Parliament what he is in practice as he's a man who cyber stalked a Mr. Beast alike a Mr. Beast adjacent person into meeting up with him making a video and hugging him and then made his name by trying to use Japanese public transport for free what much to the dismay of Japanese police who do not speak English or Greek yeah Phidius has just kind of stumbled into the Parliament mostly because his YouTube career was failing and just seems to respond politically to whoever is the top comment on his like ex-posts which is usually it's usually Elon Musk or Andrew Tate I was gonna say that's kind of transparent
1600.08 1602.88 SPEAKER_03  but then Twisted Blue Checks really kind of fucked with that
1602.88 1624.42 SPEAKER_09  yeah yeah yeah especially because he'll be like I put the poll up to see what we can do a special investigation in the European Union and you people voted for the trans problem I would put a special envoy yeah so it's just like he like one of the wildest things that is seeing them he's like doing like I guess like direct democracy through Twitter I believe it's Twitter right and
1624.42 1626.78 SPEAKER_02  well it's TikTok as well yeah yeah yeah
1626.78 1664.82 SPEAKER_09  where it's just like people who are clearly not Cypriot citizens first off probably not in the European Union and just like right wing normal ex-users will just then go and kind of you know vote for these polling things and he has like he's part of all these really bizarre committees in the European Union so that then of course means that he has access to then you know put in like special reports and be a full-time MEP I guess also the thing too to remember that then that's like no one in Cyprus votes in the European Union elections and he kind of just like got in by the fact of they have a historically low like voter turnout traditionally
1664.82 1687.58 SPEAKER_02  he is he is a strange like politically it's hard to put him down I think he's actually a dungest because like he will just go along and be like here are the foreign committees I've joined I've joined the Middle East committee because it's close to my country of Cyprus sure I've joined the American committee because I'm interested I've joined the China committee because it is the future I'm like oh okay man that's a weird thing to just say in Brussels I don't think you can say that too loud
1687.58 1697.18 SPEAKER_04  I like that his my favorite element of his vibe is how everything that he says feels like a kind of like year three school report
1697.18 1700.42 SPEAKER_03  oh yeah yeah yeah yes the best is it's like
1700.42 1713.68 SPEAKER_04  this is an Emmy this is why I love Europe is the there are so many political institutions where like you just win for showing up yeah yeah yeah it's the most participation trophy as like political system that I've ever heard of
1713.68 1723.48 SPEAKER_08  he became a politician via a Mr. Beast style competition which just so happens to be the European Parliament elections like I made a thousand people politicians overnight
1723.48 1731.02 SPEAKER_02  genuinely ran from one end of Cyprus to the other to get votes and made that a video yeah can be logistically complicated yeah you've got it
1731.02 1731.94 SPEAKER_00  in which way you run it
1731.94 1737.24 SPEAKER_02  yeah I was shot by someone in the RAF yeah I still think that like
1737.24 1743.60 SPEAKER_09  one of my favorite Fidius moments was when he was an election observer in Georgia on behalf of the European Union
1743.60 1760.28 None  and it's like filming people just like getting in fist fights in in wherever in the middle of you know rural Georgia that he is and he's just like you know nothing bad happened elections went perfectly fine you know just just we even saw a cool fight yeah
1760.28 1767.96 SPEAKER_02  he was like he was filming this old woman come in like yay first photo of the day and it's like a woman who was born before the Russian Empire collapsed
1767.96 1776.98 SPEAKER_08  she doesn't actually know that it had hey la they're probably voting over who can be Chinese the first
1776.98 1783.44 SPEAKER_03  it's a great honor which box do I tick for czar a cheer goes up from waiting voters
1783.44 1789.26 SPEAKER_08  arriving in Georgia like no it's fine I just didn't think it would be Chinese
1789.26 1858.46 SPEAKER_04  yeah this is the this is our best in Europe but I want to talk more in fact about Europe's spluttering economic engine the Franco-German relationship starting with of course Germany I'm going to read a little bit from The Economist in the blue corner it is a bitingly cold evening in Bautzen a handsome town nestled in the Oberlausitz deep in the East German state of Saxony but spirits are high at the election stand of the hard right AFD quote our land first because we love Germany proclaim banners in the party's trademark bright blue the mood inside the party is really good beams Frank Peskel who sits in Saxony's parliament it took 39% of the vote here in last year's European election and we struggle to find any local not planning to vote for it at the national election in February Simon a 20 year old says the left calls us Nazis but we just want a normal life and this seems to be how AFD is I would say portrayed I don't know if it's ignorantly or deceptively or whatever that it's like oh no this is how can they be far right people just want a nice life where we like deport everyone of a certain skin tone or darker to the tune of like Anna Lena by Honk and DJ Hutsi
1858.46 1863.82 SPEAKER_08  this is like when you read like a footnote where it's like in German the word normal can also mean Nazi
1863.82 1934.82 SPEAKER_09  it's just the sense of like you know traditionally the Nazis you know wanted everything abnormal they were very much against normal life in Germany as you know everyone knows but I think it's kind of always like a bit of both in this scenario I mean especially like you know I feel that then a lot of like English language journalists can kind of do the thing that German idiot journalists do with it like we sent someone to Trump country and this it's like you're going like Bautzen is a former like economic whatever powerhouse of East Germany a economy that doesn't exist and of course the city is completely in ruins and there is of course a bit of truth with the sense that you know people in the East voted overwhelmingly AFD you know for obviously the migration reasons but the like since reunification the East has been heavily exploited by the West wages are incredibly low there there was a thing for the longest time called like the Zolli funds which was money that then West Germany was still like giving to East Germany to rebuild that were like just recently gotten rid of and it's it's it's I think they're trying to get rid of them this election but you know 30 years after the wall fell there's still like a special fund for East Germany there is no industry there
1934.82 1938.02 SPEAKER_02  they have like a life expectancy 10 years lower in the West
1938.02 2069.22 SPEAKER_09  so there is a bit of this truth to this but also at the same time too like the AFD is getting bigger everywhere in Germany the AFD is the second like highest polling party in Germany in like Nord like Nordrhein-Westfalen like in the West which is also a post-industrial area the AFD is also quite powerful in in in in there as well they also did quite well in the elections in Niedersachsen which is another state in the West in like the metropoles I guess they're quite unpopular but I mean even in Berlin they do quite decent so I think that there is a bit of then like yes of course the economic shock of East Germany any party that then kind of comes and says we're gonna then you know do something different can be appealing to these this is also traditionally an area that then still voted for Die Linke for quite some time and the CDU was also probably like the second strongest area but then since they had been under CDU governance for such a long time a lot of these voters from the CDU kind of then like flock into then the AFD in the East fast forward to now and like the post-migration crisis you know in quotes and in such the the AFD has really kind of just normalized themselves as then we want to do like yeah like the migration thing is very much at the front of their party policy this year they've been going around Germany and I mean also kind of influencing the European Union on a greater level with just like lying about migration which is a normal thing I think now for everywhere the economy for them actually really isn't as big of a deal as they kind of like try to make it out to be so it is really the sense of that they've created a general fear within Germany around migration for like more or less like three years because they didn't really grasp COVID very well like their post-COVID numbers kind of sucked but they are it isn't the sense that people want normal like you know oh we want normal things this and then that if they did they wouldn't vote for the AFD they're a hyper libertarian party they like the the the the culture war bullshit people who are in tune with the AFD kind of don't pay attention to mainstream media typically as like other right-wing landscapes and they've driven themselves insane over migration woke bullshit and these other like non-existent sort of issues in Germany and they're pulling currently like at like 22% nationally so you can't even just blame East Germany for that alone you know
2069.22 2097.90 SPEAKER_02  yeah the numbers don't add up this high polling can't just be East Germans the thing that I think they've they got to quite early compared to like a lot of other parties in the rest of the world even is like green backlash stuff yeah they hopped on that super quick which Germany was ripe for because Germany has always had this very like you bring your own bags to the supermarket you have to buy an electric vehicle you have to recycle the cans kind of attitude to green transition they want me to
2097.90 2110.32 SPEAKER_08  bring my own bag to the supermarket but they won't let me bring the one with the swastik on it I'm reusing a very old bag but why would I buy a new bag this is bad for the environment to have this very old bag
2110.32 2130.92 SPEAKER_02  we kind of talked about it recently on the podcast but like there is this real crisis particularly with both AFD and the CDU of kind of admitting that they think that green energy is a little fruity or whatever but then not acknowledging that they can't go back to the cheap Russian gas yeah there isn't really a way to get that going
2130.92 2161.10 SPEAKER_04  again I suppose this is one of those things you realize oh that doesn't matter right because we're actually doing almost as like an entertainment force a political party as an entertainment provider is you are saying hey you don't like all this green energy makes you you think it's just a little bit like sensitive and it sort of activates your inner bully guess what we'll get the fuck rid of it and then the people are entertained and you know you kind of do your best and then you don't really deliver it it doesn't matter because you know you've you have triggered the lid there's also
2161.10 2201.90 SPEAKER_05  like something to be said because like two of the things that sort of have come up in this episode really kind of pertain to like attention and the idea of like so much of politics recently but also I think the thing that will be really definitive throughout the states and also in Europe and in the UK as well will be how like political reactionaries populist whatever you want to call them how they sort of are able to manipulate attention and the ways in which like the people who are the sort of parties that seem to be able to do it well have sort of recognized that like you can sort of use low attention spans and anger especially like anger channeled online to make yourself like not accountable for anything but also like you never have to sort of fulfill any of your promises right and you can also be really successful at it
2201.90 2209.90 SPEAKER_04  like you know what people like from the AFD they like that like one of their local parties goes around heavily migrant areas putting the airplane yeah
2209.90 2237.36 SPEAKER_09  that was in West Germany too by the way that was in Cosgore so it's even the thing too of like the AFD is kind of and I think that that's a very good thing to point out with the AFD especially they kind of do this thing where which is kind of interesting for Germany because you get in serious trouble for it but like the attention that they get is for them like them breaking the law all the time like they're constantly you know like they're always being stunned yeah like a certain mister
2237.36 2313.08 SPEAKER_05  like a yeah like a certain youtuber and it's not like it's not actually that far-fetched in the sense of like I think the thing that people like or like you know the sort of big figures like Mr. Beast have done but you know it's not to sort of say that he's a pioneer but it's more just like well okay the kind of main system of communication everyone is tied to is one that also incentivizes like consistent and perpetual novelty right and also we are you know as this whole tiktok thing kind of showed like lots and lots of people are so kind of addicted and are so like they believe that they kind of need these platforms that can hold their attention in like these 10 second 10 second or like 20 second jumps because you know in a lot of cases were the people who were complaining about the tiktok fan when they thought it was going to be more permanent like the thing that they said is like well what are we going to do without it so there's like there's this very interesting sense of like dependent on this type of system that rewards continuous novelty and political parties and some political parties that are very able to like indulge that and what's also very interesting is that the parties that are not able to do that really have no fucking idea what to do because they can't really win on any sort of economic arguments they can't really win on any international arguments like the british labour party is a very good example of this right like they can only sort of abide by a very stringent playbook that like keeps fucking them over and they're going to keep wondering like why does this keep
2313.08 2326.62 SPEAKER_04  happening what they can do is they can try and fail to be entertaining yeah right with the example of their like strange body horror video of anthropomorphic animals announcing like different means tested school lunch policies or whatever right it comes
2326.62 2378.02 SPEAKER_05  well it comes off as very weird but I think the final point that I'll make on this is like well the stunts that work like and in general like you know you think about like the things that people are really entertained by you know even like non-politically it's like stuff where people are embarrassed where people sort of get like you know that they're sort of like observed and judged a lot of like the content that goes viral and I think sort of very much has like a political tinge to it is one where like you are sort of shaming people like lots of different things I think like you know the sort of abundance of like Andrew Tate style misogynistic content is a very good example of this and I think it's just like you have political parties who are just kind of like on the right who are very aware of this impulse and also recognize for like as you guys have mentioned like you know they don't really give a shit about economics anymore they don't really give a shit about like actually fixing things materially none of the far-right parties are actually like promising the people that they are saying we're going to get rid of the immigrants and make your life easier but not actually sort of saying how they're going to do that
2378.02 2425.48 SPEAKER_09  oh the AFD is the AFD has a plan absolutely it is it is to break German law but still I mean like they've this is the thing too is that then it's like I agree to a lot of points about then I guess Germany is a bit different of an ecosystem because of how Germans interact with social media is not the same as the UK or the US like it is like Twitter is not a thing really here not that it was you know popular before Elon but after Elon it's been even less so I mean I guess in right-wing circles but they've also like kind of done the kind of Trump branding to where they're also very proud of being like stupid the like you know they they're like one of their one of their election posters has a guy with the shirt and it like the the slogan says finally I can say what I want again and then his shirt says hashtag schwachkopf which in German means like weak-minded and he's like proudly like standing
2425.48 2432.38 SPEAKER_08  there like laughing and yeah and it's a t-shirt they might have made you wear in Germany at one
2432.38 2453.84 SPEAKER_02  time but um yeah I mean like to an extent like yeah because we talked about the the deportation tickets they were handing out to presumably terrified people of color in Karlsruhe or whatever but like the real gambit was the fact that it was like we handed out to 20 people here it becomes a new story Germany-wide and a bunch of people just kind of like nod in agreement with it and the CDU wants to do the
2453.84 2467.74 SPEAKER_09  same policy you know which is even like absolutely the thing too is that the AFD has also like moved the Overton window of all the parties now to as far right as they probably historically have ever been minus you know a little period in between but you know
2467.74 2502.20 SPEAKER_02  yeah and they also like AFD is very good at spinning like a lot of these kind of like German very German World War II memory law kind of stuff like Alice Weidel who's the head of the party got in trouble once for calling East Germany middle Germany or Central Germany which can't do that anymore so like yeah but that definitely there's definitely like a non-zero number of guys who read that story being like oh you can't say anything anymore like I accidentally call East Germany Central Germany or whatever and like they're gonna throw her in jail because of woke or whatever you can't even you can't even call it Konigsberg
2502.20 2516.06 SPEAKER_08  anymore what I'm learning here is that actually Cyprus is ahead of the curve because they already have a Cypriot Mr. Beast politician but this is what Germany is crying out for it's gonna be like I gave 20 immigrants plane tickets like soy face and
2516.06 2516.42 SPEAKER_02  that's what they're
2516.42 2521.44 SPEAKER_08  looking for I retook the Sudeten land you know that's yeah her animal
2521.44 2526.42 SPEAKER_02  it's a lecture it's a lecture me fragrance to the Bundestag yeah
2526.42 2531.54 SPEAKER_09  hey baby where are you I was accused of calling
2531.54 2540.48 SPEAKER_04  it middle Germany my father died the thing to remember about Germany as well is that the soundtrack to the creeping fascism is Schlager oh yeah yeah
2540.48 2579.24 SPEAKER_09  yeah yeah that's the thing too is that like like it's it's the most bizarre thing seeing Alice Videl like I mean you do have members of the party like Bjorn Höcke who does like practice his Hitler shit in the mirror you can tell he has gotten in trouble for quoting Goebbels and used to write under the name like Landolf Ladej for the NPD's like like newspaper the NPD being the like the actual Nazi party that you can legally call them a Nazi party but Alice Videl kind of like tries to do in a similar vein of this whole thing of like oh like you know they're not gonna do this and there's just videos of her just yelling like they're not gonna take our schnitzel and like you can't take it seriously because it
2579.24 2580.30 SPEAKER_00  really it really is
2580.30 2596.20 SPEAKER_09  exactly that it is it is it is blasting like some guy named like you know DJ DJ Harry cock or whatever like you know uh let's do it soo knock knock uh uh fucking Mallorca or whatever I don't know bullshit song have you heard about this guy DJ
2596.20 2605.34 SPEAKER_07  Harry cock yeah I'm gonna have him play my next inauguration actually great guy K-O-C-H folks K-O-C-H and it is it is this
2605.34 2643.70 SPEAKER_09  thing too because they like they they do like that for them is German culture that they want to preserve and I know that then people have I talked about this like on a on a recent episode of Corner Speedy of like people I think like to have a um you know even on the left like a rosy uh eye view of like how Nazis liked culture they were still like morons in the 30s you know they hated anything that they saw as like degeneracy it's kind of similarly to with how this is and like I think Kieran explained on the episode that it was like this is like the Nazis were kind of the equivalent of just like oh well like in in our modern age would be like just guys who thought like Van Halen was like really cool in terms of like the like difference of of time
2643.70 2652.00 SPEAKER_02  you know it seems sophisticated now but they were advocating for music that was just like 10 years older than jazz yeah I love the song yum
2652.00 2660.32 SPEAKER_04  I had songs but again it's in Germany all of this is soundtracked by like a DJ that includes an accordion yeah yeah
2660.32 2668.32 SPEAKER_09  essentially yeah and it's like songs about like you know like like being like playing cowboy in Indian with your lover or whatever it's corny it's
2668.32 2693.70 SPEAKER_04  horrible that's a specific that is a specific song cowboy in Indiana yeah yeah there's I know Valka Valk I know Valka Schnee you know Die Nacht auf Freitag auf Montag Joanna there's one unfortunately named Schwarze Natasha and that's what they all want to bring back they just want to that that they've this is what Germany is going to it's their fascism is is soundtrack to like the
2693.70 2703.44 SPEAKER_02  fucking number one for three weeks in the German charts was an AI generated song called oh Philippe in an Talerhoun yeah yeah like I fell in love
2703.44 2707.08 SPEAKER_09  in an Talerhoun which is a racial slur unfortunately but
2707.08 2717.30 SPEAKER_02  I fell in love with a racial slur for an Arab German yeah Jesus and it was in the style of like maybe more of a kind of an older Schlager but Schlager nonetheless yeah
2717.30 2789.34 SPEAKER_04  let's let's talk about Alice Vidal before we do finish off with our reading which is a crucially important that we get to the reading today is so important because it is one of the biggest stories I think of the last year Alice Vidal is the leader of the AFD this is from a profile from the FT she's not fit the stereotype of a right-wing radical she's married to a Sri Lankan born Swiss film producer Sarah Bussard with whom she has two adopted children in Switzerland after graduating she spent time as an analyst for Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt and later wrote a doctoral thesis in the Chinese pension system and you know I think this is a bit you know naive from the FT is being like oh hey this person who appears to be culturally genteel who has a lot of the markers of intelligence like or culturedness and is in touch with things that we not consider to be vulgar and also is a lesbian you wouldn't expect this person to be a right-wing radical and it's like well no you just what you're mistaking is like you are mistaking things you recognize in someone like you would consider to be normal right you're mistaking that for someone who's not then going to be you might say either extremely personally ambitious enough to start you know let's say referring to East Germany as middle Germany or or who is simply a good person you're mistaking these things for one another yeah it is it is quite
2789.34 2794.54 SPEAKER_08  funny though when it's like do you do you hate Vogue boy do I have the lesbian in a multilaracial
2794.54 2795.80 SPEAKER_00  relationship for you
2795.80 2804.52 SPEAKER_08  yeah it's really it's not what you expected new Hitler to be aside from all the gender we know that also bullshit about being educated or whatever but that one detail is
2804.52 2815.48 SPEAKER_03  unusual it's sort of international like we've got gay Hitler and Trump we've got lesbian Hitler and I was vital so you know I'm excited to find out about like bisexual Hitler and
2815.48 2819.52 SPEAKER_00  then it's also no one's ready for NB Hitler
2819.52 2833.04 SPEAKER_09  one last point to her biography that then I think is also quite interesting that the FT didn't put in it is that maybe they did I didn't read it but like she was bankrolled by the CDU for a while like to do her
2833.04 2845.20 SPEAKER_02  like her she's a she's a to kind of hammer home about like the AFD is not necessarily new politics in Germany and like if the CDU wins this election which they will it's not a good thing like she is a CDU politician the only
2845.20 2855.70 SPEAKER_09  reason that she went to the AFD is because her advisor for her PhD was like who was a member of the CDU was like oh hey there's a sick new cool party you want to come with me and he was one of the founders of the party
2855.70 2858.96 SPEAKER_02  yeah the CDU is cucked we gotta go to so we gotta go to this cool politics
2858.96 2873.18 SPEAKER_09  are incredibly normal in Germany unfortunately like you know it does this whole like you know oh wow can you believe this but it's like these people like most of them within the AFD have been I mean they're the the party with the highest percentage of of PhDs in their like
2873.18 2875.02 SPEAKER_02  yeah but like German PhDs
2875.02 2899.16 SPEAKER_09  doesn't matter though still but it's this idea then like bullshit or not PhD it's still like a like the idea that like oh can you believe that they're you know well educated it's like yeah like I've met a lot of fucking completely stupid people with PhDs especially in this country because every year there's a scandal of someone plagiarizing their thesis or some shit but yeah this this like whole kind of background for her and this and that and that is like very very very very normal within the AFD
2899.16 2903.14 SPEAKER_04  as as November said least racist German white German lesbian
2903.14 2913.74 SPEAKER_08  hello you do hear me it's it's me your cousin Marvin Marvin Hitler you know that new party you've been looking for well listen to this
2913.74 2917.36 SPEAKER_03  that party you used to like is going to come back in style
2917.36 2922.74 SPEAKER_08  yeah it's mostly accordions but the saying very right-wing stuff over the
2922.74 2922.96 SPEAKER_03  top
2922.96 2926.68 SPEAKER_02  it's not coming out in the mix you gotta listen to it
2926.68 2937.00 SPEAKER_04  yeah so asked to explain the apparent incongruity between her private life her party's opposition to quote gender and woke ideology she said I'm not queer I'm just married to a woman who I've known for 20 years
2937.00 2943.34 SPEAKER_00  this is a this is actually just a
2943.34 2949.98 SPEAKER_03  coincidence I tripped and fell and landed with my tongue in her pussies this is totally normal
2949.98 2958.24 SPEAKER_02  Germany gets like the early 90s anime dubs thing where the clearly lesbian couple are just called cousins so one
2958.24 2963.08 SPEAKER_04  senior party official put it she's gay by biology but not by political conviction
2963.08 2986.44 SPEAKER_02  unlike Donald Trump she's going up there at the podium be like I didn't choose this it's not a choice of course I don't know you also like you also get that looped up like because I think there's so much like cultural confusion there as well because a lot of the times with gender when referencing the right in Germany is this like stop trying to make me speak the woke German is a lot of like what these right-wing
2986.44 2992.26 SPEAKER_09  grievances are they banned they ban gender speak in Bavaria which is hilarious for a country that has gender
2992.26 3003.88 SPEAKER_04  okay we're choosing D or dear we are just choosing fun and it's the neutral one you know what everything is boys
3003.88 3011.28 SPEAKER_09  now I have to agree with the anti-woke crusade if it came in the sense of having one article in German all right like
3011.28 3015.12 SPEAKER_03  it doesn't make it easier for us come on you don't need these they
3015.12 3019.32 SPEAKER_08  have made all of the things masculine but now the book is gave is the book case
3019.32 3023.08 SPEAKER_01  it has become vogue no
3023.08 3026.26 SPEAKER_02  my non-binary book god damn it
3026.26 3029.26 SPEAKER_08  I'm right I'm woke I'm gay
3029.26 3036.58 SPEAKER_02  yeah like you can imagine the amount of shit that happened to like Bud Light but when they find out that beer in German is also das like that was the same kind of
3036.58 3058.40 SPEAKER_04  like backlash shit hate to say that what we can kind of if we want to draw these two segments together sort of US Germany I think what we're finding in both is ever since sort of the various political upsets of the 2010s the official if you want to say vibe shift right the vibe shift that has happened is that all of these people the gender of the word vibe which is
3058.40 3064.62 SPEAKER_09  also coming back in style vibe is a word in German for for a whore by the way
3064.62 3150.36 SPEAKER_04  yes yeah oh my but these if you that that shift is you're going to talk call it the vibe shift is that these people the political tendencies they represent all of the powerful have sorted out all of their like lingering questions and doubts about whether or not they should be sort of fallen in behind four square and those questions have been resolved to yes they're fine we can work with them it'll be great march in you know like the firewall of parties refusing to cooperate with AFD how long is that going to last these sort of widespread sort of condemnation of Trump the differences between the first inauguration and this one it's a universe of difference right of the respect and deference that he so craved that is now being shown to him and with someone like that going back to Trump specifically for whom respect and deference is so important so personally important but who knows what kind of difference that could make to someone who is so personalist and arbitrary in his rule and the again the with a lot of people who are like you know AFD big wigs they also crave you know looking to Kieran and Nick for this one respect and deference and it seems as though the ground is being laid for them to have it just as it's being laid to give it to reform in the UK I mean now we're saying like okay we're throwing up our hands we'll have another grooming gangs inquiry because like all of the people who we used to think were political poison have asked for it and we kind of have to do what they say because they're insiders now what we have witnessed is a great insider making of people who were previously at least kind
3150.36 3176.56 SPEAKER_02  of outside yeah I mean like the conversation when Trump got elected like he's been inaugurated now but conversation was not like there was no condemnation there was no like America's gone to hell in a hand basket that you expect from Europe last time it was all just like accommodation how do we work with this how do we make him happy and this is like the cultural equivalent of it the more material equivalent is just like speeding up construction of those LNG terminals and like the Atlantic coast but like on one last note with the
3176.56 3235.84 SPEAKER_09  Trump thing I think one of the very you know kind of going back then to the CDU on this is that then there is a general like a the party of Maco that then was like praised for so long internationally as being like a kind of like liberal conservative party overwhelmingly likes Trump this time around there was no like there was always kind of like these like pockets within the CDU of like oh yeah like we think he's cool but the general overwhelming attitude within the CDU the the incoming government is that Trump is not only like will they work with him he has the politic that they like the head of the CSU said this yesterday that he thinks that the way that Trump does politics is great he has a good attitude the head of the CDU for Dick Mance who will be the next chancellor of Germany is going to send him like a love letter apparently to the inauguration so this is also the thing too that regardless of the AFD and the super far right also like the Melonization I guess you can say of like Europe has also made like of the like general like historical conservative parties has also made this easing up to Trump not even just like oh we have to do and it's like they're they're happy about it they're stoked yeah it's great
