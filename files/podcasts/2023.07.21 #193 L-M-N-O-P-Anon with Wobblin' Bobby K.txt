so
so so so all right all right all right all right
uh pardon me if this episode is a little bit more uh scattered and harried it's a different kind
of episode for me because there there are a few different things i want to get to and and for
various reasons i'm feeling uh kind of uh brittle and frangible at the moment you know lightning
fuse power cut scatterbrain every this is by the by but ever since my first uh major total
psychotic breakdown in 2010 i have been under the continuous impression that the wind is uh
blowing pieces of me off and indeed pieces of the world around me off and it's not like violence
it's not like there's blood it's just i'm crumbling as the wind blows at me and the world around me
is crumbling as the wind blows at me and behind that crumbling structure there is revealed just
a blank a recording medium a surface onto which things can be inscribed very much like uh if you've
ever looked at a piece of uh audio tape ever worked with a reel-to-reel machine you can see
the audio tape is made basically out of a a band of plastic and then upon that band of plastic on
both sides of it there is a coating of magnetically charged ferrous oxide and if you play the same tape
over and over and over and over especially on a bad tape machine that ferrous oxide will start to
crumble and flake off and you will have blanks in the recording this is incidentally why uh
when when frank zappa came to reissue uh a bunch of his uh better known early mothers of invention
albums from the 60s he had to put some new drum and bass tracks on some of them because the tape
you could see through it all the oxide had flaked off and uh i've felt like that essentially every day
for the last let's see soon it'll be 13 years um and you can imagine how that dovetails in my mind
with the valter bignamine you know angel of history a storm is blowing from paradise being blown backwards
into the future uh that's kind of my that's kind of my basic operating mode if you need to think of me
and god knows why you would but people need all kinds of different things think of me that way in um
you know in a wrought iron chair out in the dark having the wind uh blow pieces of me away
and i uh i am particularly feeling like that now for i mean something i i wouldn't mention under most
circumstances but because uh i have had to talk about medical and psychiatric shit on this show to
you know elucidate what i hope were you know larger points about the way things were and not just my
fucking personal agony diary um just to let you know the state of psychiatry at the moment i am
currently undergoing a very unwanted uh very unwelcome medication change because i was offered
essentially three options number one was this medication change number two was i let the doctors
make me a junkie again but this time on a safer better kind of junk that they can monitor and number
three was uh we completely rewrite all your diagnoses and then buddy it's time to get strapped down to the
gurney and turn on the electroshock machine it's it's pretty disconcerting actually how many people have
tried to get me to to take ect within just the last couple years so um i'm you know i'm feeling a
little brittle i'm i'm feeling those chips being uh blown off of me at the moment and i also as
mentioned at the top have to do a couple different things in this episode i was planning it to be one
thing then a whole other thing happened and then a whole other thing happened and i am going to get
back to the the paganism logic of metaphor thing i'm definitely going to get back to that hopefully
uh as soon as the next episode because there's a lot more to say but i felt that there was a sort
of public phenomenon over the last couple of weeks that deserved a longer comment than i was able to give
it on a place like twitter and uh also to sort of do a little preview of a thing i've been working on
for a long time a thing that will hopefully be out soon as well about let's say gladio this term that
we are now uh more or less all familiar with right about gladio not as a series of incidents or as a
program or as even a specific network of people but gladio as the underlying logic of the entire post
world war ii you know liberal democratic capitalist world order that it's it's it's not an accident and
it wasn't merely a convenience it was something that was completely necessary to the enterprise
and the people planning the enterprise knew that the entire fucking time and gladio you know we call
it that because we know that was the the particular name for the uh the operations in italy we also have
reason to think they kept using that name because of some um classified documents that got leaked by an
fbi translator uh gladio has been the the under the table part of of all the you know francis fukuyama
end of history shiny happy people horseshit this entire time and it's never stopped it's never even come
close to stopping to stop it to stop it would be to stop politics as we know them and i'm going to do
something much larger on that but i felt it incumbent upon me to mention today specifically some of you
probably remember although it is incredible how quickly this shit gets elighted and just vanished
an incident during the uh u.s military withdrawal quote unquote from afghanistan when uh a lot of
people were killed and injured by a bombing at an airport and this bombing was credited to isis k
isis khorasan which allegedly is a kind of minor league branch of isis that seeks to establish a chunk of
the isis caliphate in a historical region called khorasan which uh to my understanding now makes up parts of
modern pakistan and afghanistan um and i was suspicious of this from the very beginning and
said so i believe on the show back when it happened because we heard not long after the bombing that a
british intelligence knew this bombing was going to happen it's unambiguous it's not like there's a
rumor about that they were on record saying they knew this bombing was going to happen and yet when the
bombing did happen uh the civilians at this airport were were guided toward the abbey gate the place
where the bombing happened not away from it by people who knew what was going on and of course as soon as
this happens after all this rhetoric about withdrawal you have joe biden immediately on tv going come on man
we're not we're not gonna let this kind of thing i mean we'll send everybody in there that we gotta
send okay you know we're gonna gotta get these son of a bitches so basically pledging um what i think was
the point of the entire thing that is we'll wind down afghanistan as a traditional military occupation
so that we may transform it into the the rumsfeld obama model of war that has come to succeed
those traditional occupations which is to say light footprint low visibility doing everything you can
through the cia through military contractors and particularly through special forces and the
the jsoc joint command of of you know elite operators from every branch of the service this was a way not
to stop a war in afghanistan but to continue it under a different guise and it is this guise that has
allowed us to act militarily and let's see the number may have even changed by now but the last time i read
it i believe the 2001 uh afghanistan authorization for the use of military force has now been used to
conduct at least one operation in something like 86 countries this is the way of the future or rather it's
the way of the present that people are are beginning to get a grip on and if you go way back to uh early
death corner episodes i don't even remember where i talked about this actually i think it was an episode
when when that miserable old fuck rumsfeld died about how as much as we would like to think otherwise as
much as i wish it weren't true donald rumsfeld won donald rumsfeld got what he wanted which was
essentially the the transformation of u.s military empire from big cumbrous ugly slogs of occupations
to essentially joint cia special forces and contractor operations all over the world that are small enough
that most people will never hear about them and they are very specifically detail oriented or goal oriented
uh in a way that would make them difficult to describe as wars per se uh for example you can
think of all the black water contractors or whatever fucking name they're using now who are doing things
like guarding oil fields guarding poppy plantations guarding uh mines all over africa all over the middle east
you know are those wars are those really wars are we gonna call them wars well no and that that's the uh
the rumsfeld model and it seems to me that this you know heralded withdrawal from afghanistan
on biden's part was mostly a way to get some credit for supposedly being a you know an anti-war or anti-imperialist
president from the left you remember in the the early days of the biden presidency when there was a
fucking think piece every two weeks like is biden the most progressive president in the history of the
country is joe biden the new fdr and this was part of all that what he was actually doing was just taking
a clunky failed war admitting a kind of defeat and then retrofitting it for a much subtler kind of war
so the story about a bombing as we're leaving causing us to immediately recommit whatever forces we have
to recommit come on man you gotta take down these evildoers uh naturally made me suspicious
and some of you probably know seth harp the excellent journalist not just of war but uh war is
one of his specialties and particularly the drug trade in afghanistan and the way that is uh seamlessly
interlocked with politics there and be it said the way we talk about mexico as this lawless cartel state
as you know a a narcocracy as as this complete nightmare land ruled by drug dealers well there's
obviously some truth in that uh only and as to the extent that these people have the backing of
the dea the cia whatever other uh american bodies of power make the decisions about who gets to prosper
there and who doesn't and boy you are gonna see a whole lot of cartel shit ramping up if uh amlo if
andres manuel lopez obrador keeps trying to pursue uh for example nationalizing pimex the mexican state oil
company that was privatized i think 40 years ago perhaps um it is to me obscene for us to talk about that
without talking about the way that we helped create it via both direct support for the cartels and
via legislation like nafta which ensured that there would essentially always be a gigantic impoverished
subjected workforce there that has essentially no rights and if they even mention something like uh
starting a union they get fucking decapitated in the desert so it's always been disgusting me
pardon me disgusting to me to talk about mexico that way without talking about our involvement in it
but particularly so when you know these great years of the drug war in mexico are the same years the same
period we were running afghanistan as a cartel state because make no mistake that is what we were doing
the people who you would see described as you know u.s allies or uh members of the coalition or you know
engaged with the northern alliance or trying to help build state democratic power in afghanistan
they almost invariably have massive uh drug trafficking connections and this brings us back to
isis k and to seth harp and i don't know if this is new information uh that just came out or if it's been
around for a while and i wasn't aware of it but seth put me on to this and i would like to uh like to read
you just a remarkable few facts so supposedly the leader of isis k was a guy named shahab al-mukhajir
which was not his real name his real name was allegedly sanahla gafari uh he was according to some reports
killed in june this year but of course finding out about the death or for that matter life of almost
anyone involved in a group like this is we're probably never gonna know but it's not so much his uh
his state of of life or death that makes shahab al-mukhajir interesting to us it's what he did before
supposedly becoming the would-be caliph of isis khorasan shahab al-mukhajir he uh he had a background
in military contracting and within that particularly bodyguard work and he was a u.s military contractor
at bagram airfield which some of you probably remember from the uh the early afghanistan war days
was the sort of nerve center for the entire military occupation of afghanistan would be funny of us to
award a contract uh to someone who is supposedly a bloodthirsty genocidal islamist militant if we
didn't know anything about that but it gets more interesting because after the uh the contracting
work at bagram uh al-mukhajir moved into bodyguard work into personal security and the first notable guy
for whom he did that work was a fellow named abdur rashid dostum and if you look up rashid dostum
you will see him described as an afghan politician who held the various offices within the punitive
government of hamid karzai if you remember that fucking guy and that is technically true but rashid dostum
is also a massively powerful heroin trafficker and was also one of the most important cia proxies
in afghanistan who used you know his heroin empire was such that he had his own sort of uh i guess you
would call them paramilitary group or militia he tried to start a political party at one point to gain
control of afghanistan he is the biggest kind of drug lord you can be including the necessary connection
to the fucking cia and rashid dostum uh as a cia proxy is notable for a number of war crimes especially
something that you probably don't remember because it happened in december 2001 when all the press here
was rah rah fucking bullshit about stopping terrorism uh and this was an event called the
dashti leili massacre and it's got massacre in the name so the members of dostum's you know paramilitary
group militia and putative uh party the junbish imili which is kind of a multi-ethnic islamist coalition
and militia and imaginary would-be government and exile a little bit like ahman chalabi the the
the idea that they're constantly you know six fucking real governments of afghanistan that are
only just waiting for their chance with with of course the right amount of american guns and money
to uh to retake control of their country from the fucking usurpers well dostum's guys junbish imili
they captured it's not known exactly how many but basically somewhere between a thousand and two
thousand alleged taliban fighters right and they took these fighters these prisoners and put them
in a metal shipping containers on the pretense that they were going to be transported somewhere else to
be imprisoned actually what they did is get these guys in the shipping containers and then either stand
outside of them and just fucking riddle them with machine gun fire or more commonly just locked the
doors of the containers and let these prisoners suffocate and suffocation is a bad enough way to go
no matter how what happens but suffocation in a fucking packed shipping container climbing over
corpses of people you probably know to try to get near the ceiling for the last fucking molecule of oxygen
that's uh that's horrifying and the full numbers on this the full details on this will probably never
be known because of course of course dostum has our backing never needs to worry about prosecution for any
of this but it's called the dashdi layli massacre because a number of the secret graves of these
alleged stress that again uh murdered taliban fighters uh were discovered in a place called dashdi layli
in afghanistan and that is not the only thing of that nature that rashid dostum has ever been involved in
he's an out and out war criminal and and top level drug lord uh one of the most feared people in afghanistan
so that's an interesting fellow for the uh the supposed future head of an anti-american islamist
apocalyptic caliphate cult to be working for that would be strange enough that and the bagram military
contracting but then then our boy shahab al-mukhajir moved on to uh working personal security for amrullah
saleh and amrullah saleh was the head of the national directorate of security in afghanistan the nds
and the nds was transparently a cia proxy i mean this is a you know supposed all-seeing all-knowing
uh intelligence agency that was founded in 2002 they were working with fucking nothing and the nds was
essentially just a way to supply uh legitimacy to whatever it was that american intelligence and
particularly the cia wanted to do in afghanistan so other than literally working for the cia with you
know a fucking paying your taxes saying cia agent you know having a name tag it would be hard to get
closer to being an outright cia agent cia agent than amrullah saleh was in those years and his bodyguard
was our man from isis k and the saleh has also had a subsequently interesting career uh after the
intelligence work and isn't it amazing how these people who who work in security and intelligence
always seem to find themselves sort of surprisingly but you know fittingly given their backgrounds
elevated to other positions of political power well in uh 2020 he became the vice president
of afghanistan uh but lost only a year later to a fellow named sirajuddin haqqani if you know the
name haqqani if that's uh if that's setting some lights off in your brain you are correct sirajuddin haqqani
was the son of a fellow named jalaluddin haqqani who set up the haqqani network which was essentially a
a combination of a guerrilla army and an intelligence agency in various uh eras of afghan politics and
during the soviet afghan war you know operation cyclone the billion fucking dollars and and
unimaginable unimaginable amount of weaponry the cia poured into that fucking country
springing every mentally ill islamist from all over the muslim world to come fight as
quote-unquote afghan arabs and the brave the legendary the storied the wonderful
mujahideen whom of course we loved back then we were including them in the credits of fucking action
movies uh so at the time the american government we're talking mid late 80s here huge fan of jalaluddin haqqani
and of the haqqani network in general uh ronald reagan called him a freedom fighter and this is
this is one of the the shittiest quotes i've ever heard about anyone in the entire run of this show
charlie fucking wilson that miserable bastard senator who uh sort of took on the the soviet afghan war and
u.s cia involvement via operation cyclone as his kind of personal playground there is an insane
fucking movie about that guy called charlie wilson's war from uh early 2000s which paints him as sort of
a you know just happy-go-lucky freedom fighter and uh you know the the things that happened in afghanistan
well you know he sort of made afghanistan into his playground and carried out all kinds of goofs and
spoofs and hijinks and murdered more people than we will ever know and led directly to everything
that's happened in afghanistan since then but the guy you know you can't help but like him he's just a
tough talking southerner with a big old heart smoking a cigar that looks like a fat brown dick every day
and that charlie wilson referred to jalaluddin haqqani as and i quote goodness personified
which is just like dude you gotta try a little bit you can't just say that that's oh god damn just
so far over the top that that the standards just stop applying to anything well as you might imagine
uh after the soviet afghan war when we started getting in there jalaluddin haqqani suddenly became
public enemy number one and the haqqani network was now referred to as you know a sprawling vastly
powerful insidious terrorist organization so there's something there's a beautiful kind of
symmetry in the fact that amrullah saleh our cia boy who was the first vice president of afghanistan
uh has now been beaten for that office by siraj adin haqqani the son of the guy whose paramilitary
network we first called goodness personified and now have uh shifted toward a a uh less charitable
evaluation of so i thought in the context of the idea of gladio as something structural and permanent
and ongoing that believe uh that deserved rather that merited specific mention because i had talked
about my suspicions of the the abbey gate bombing incident since 2021 when it happened and i am going
to do a a fuller show maybe more than one on that general topic but now i turn to what originally
was my main uh my main cause motivation for this show what i originally thought i needed to talk about
and uh we're gonna play a little game here okay and i am going to read you a list and in that list
every time i say blank that means something has been redacted from an official document okay
so here's here's just a list of things and every time you hear blank you think of a black bar over
the rest of it blank mount kisco new york 914 blank home in parentheses 914 blank work in parentheses
email blank at law.pace.edu blank blank white plains new york blank 914 blank 914 blank 914 blank 914 blank
914 blank 914 blank blank 917 blank emergency contact kerry cuomo that is a list of every address phone number email
jeffrey epstein had for robert f kennedy jr he's in the black book he's really really in the black book
and uh i don't have any specific information to implicate rfk jr in any of the specific things
epstein did i suspect and hope we will hear about this at some point in the future but if jeffrey epstein
needs what was that 12 ways to get in contact with you including two physical addresses and a secret
emergency contact uh that suggests to me that you and jeff were not just even good friends uh that
would suggest to me that you and he were in business in one way or another and it may be let's let's
pretend we're morons here it may be that that business was completely above board and all had to do with
charity and environmental activism and furthering the sciences although i allow me to remind you
all these people who talk about well i was at i was at epstein's place because he just he was such a
passionate fan of the sciences and of intellectual inquiry and i was there for the conversations and the
ideas they were so big let us recall that the only two actual comments from epstein that we have
from these uh these supposed summits of great scientific and technological minds one of them
was epstein repeatedly asking different kinds of scientists if before he died they could remove
his head and dick and put them on a robot he asked a lot of people about the head and dick robot that was
a major concern to him and the other comment was also apparently one he made repeatedly when he would
have these people stephen pinker bill gates over at his house noam chomsky and uh they would be
talking about intellectual matters that are of of great fascination to the scientifically minded man
and epstein would break into the conversation with the comment what does this have to do with pussy
those are the two things we know he said about science and this is a man who uh you may recall was
personally appointed to the board of directors of rockefeller university which is exactly what it
fucking sounds like a graduate only science and tech university in new york i mean you don't get on
the board of that kind of place by acting it's not just you're somebody's friend so they put you on the
board right you supposedly have some kind of qualifications for doing this sort of thing so
let's again let's pretend we're much stupider than we are and pretend that jeffrey epstein only needed
12 different ways to get in touch with rfk jr because it was completely above board the question
then to me would be what kind of life is bobby kennedy jr living what kind of circles is he moving in
uh what sort of people is he listening to what kind of advice is he taking that he would be that close
to jeffrey fucking epstein because again even if none of this was criminal we have seen very very
clearly that epstein was dug like a fucking tick into the upper levels of political power and especially
democratic party political power and especially the segments of democratic party political power
that dealt with israel policy fucking ehud barak going to his house more than 10 but less than 100
times one of the worst excuses in the history of the world um if we are to take someone like rfk
seriously as an outsider a dark horse a man who's trying to hack the system coming from below to tear
down this evil edifice um then why exactly did he spend so much time around jeffrey fucking epstein
and this is and i want to make clear here the reason i'm talking about this is not to just take shots
at rfk jr which is very very easy there are a lot of shots you can take at the motherfucker
and it's not to tell you not to vote for him because to be clear um 99.99999 percent of the time
i don't care if you vote at all let alone whom you vote for and to the long-running fucking facile
moronic argument that you know if you don't vote you can't complain you don't get to say anything
about the system no no no no no no no no here's the thing uh if you vote in the primaries and in
the general for someone who's a complete piece of shit out of some sort of necessity or harm reduction
argument the thing i've been hearing my entire life that yeah obviously the democratic candidate for
president senate whatever yeah obviously he's a piece of shit you know obviously she's evil whatever
but it's harm reduction we have to stop the other person if you vote for those people over and over
you are telling the democratic party machinery hey i will eat any shit you feed me i will spend my life
with my fucking lips pursed around your asshole just guzzling shit and then i will high-handedly
and condescendingly criticize anyone who doesn't do the exact same fucking thing and so if you give
me bill clinton in 1992 and then i mean clinton himself is fucking horrific enough speaking of
jeffrey epstein only went on four trips with jeffrey sure the four trips were 27 flights but that's
still just four trips son of a bitch if you give me clinton in 92 yeah i'll eat that shit and then
what you're gonna do is you're gonna give me a worse version of bill clinton every time every time
every time every election is gonna get worse and worse and worse and worse and i'm gonna keep eating
that shit because it's my patriotic duty and to those people i would say no no no it's not uh it's
not people who don't vote that don't get to criticize it's people who allow these candidates to keep being
the nominees that don't get to criticize you brought the motherfucker here if you had the fucking
discipline if you had the fucking morals the sense of justice the integrity anything to refuse to eat
this year's plate of shit you might be able to change something probably not but you might be able to
but you're not interested in even trying all right so i don't care if you vote i don't care whom you vote
for frankly i don't think it matters all that much and the reason i am talking about robert f kennedy jr
is not to tell you don't vote for him or you know he's easy to make fun of or he's a piece of shit
whatever that is not the point of what i'm talking about at all i am talking about him and about this
presidential campaign uh in particular because i think it is demonstrative of a couple of trends
that worry me on a level much more pervasive and much more long lasting than just you know rfk
jr for president and one of them is what um you will see from the title of the show is what i i have kind of
privately to myself been referring to as a long time as element op anon which is to say hey whatever
conspiracy thing whatever whatever conspiratorial thought you're into whether that is a completely
real and actual conspiracy like the assassinations of the kennedys or malcolm x or martin luther king
or uh fucking participation in eugenics programs in prisons or 9-11 or the hideous lies that have led to
every american war since 9-11 or the fact that we have been actively cooperating with nazis since the
1930s and nazi germany could not have existed without us particularly the people who became
the cia and that we hired as many of them as we possibly could to run third world countries as
proxy nazis for us hey that's all real right we've talked a lot about all of that but you got some shit
about 5g you got some shit about how a flu vaccine gave you spasmodic dysphonia you you you're interested
in a miracle mineral medical solution that uh is basically bleach and you drink it every day and it
makes you shit out the lining of your intestines and uh your doctor says those are rope worms and you're
eliminating intestinal parasites sure just slam it all on board hence the lmnop it's not anything it's
not about anything it doesn't focus on anything it doesn't actually critique anything it is just a
fucking magnetic grab bag of anything that anyone thinks that is counter to the prevailing logic that
persists through the american political system and the american media complex right this to me is a
real fucking serious problem because i think we have seen i mean i know we've seen um in the last
10 years maybe a little bit less than that a a genuine sea change in american attitudes towards certain
things uh it's not a massive one it's it's not a commanding or overwhelming one but to take for
example the kennedy assassination at no point in the history of this country has the majority of the
american population actually believed the warren commission report at no point this country has never
mostly thought yeah oswald killed kennedy by himself and then ruby killed oswald by himself as liz franzak
says the dual loan nut theory we don't believe that shit but people knew to leave it well enough
alone for their professional and social standing for most of the last 60 years people have known
essentially like yeah of course it's not real but if you talk about it you're a fucking weirdo
and you don't want to be classed in with those fucking weirdos because this is where the lmnop effect
starts you you uh try to make contact with other people who have serious uh merited deep-rooted
questions about for example why would they kill jfk and if you're not careful six months later you're
reading about like alien maglev train technology that would enable us to uh recolonize the hollow earth
or some shit this is a strategy this is a very direct obvious in your face political strategy
because the warren commission was not actually intended to convince anyone it is a a fact i come
back to often that of all the people who were on the warren commission and lyndon johnson who oversaw the
thing uh every single one of them bar one admitted at one point or another that he thought the warren
commission's conclusion was bullshit every one of them admitted yeah this cannot be what happened
at least some part of this is just flagrantly false and you know who the only one who didn't recant any of
it was alan fucking dolus because of course he didn't because he wrote the fucking thing because he was one of
the people who killed john kennedy it was not intended ever to to give some version of the truth
that americans could be relied upon to hew close to for the rest of history no it was just designed
to put a big fucking stumbling block in the middle of the road to supply as much completely fucking
irrelevant schizophrenic detail as possible about every conceivable you know
tiny little twig of a tree that fell next to someone's foot on an important day in the
louisiana swamp in october 1963 to overwhelm you with all that bullshit with uh you know what was it
there's a great line in libra uh by don de lillo where he says that the warren commission report
is the book that james joyce would have written if he'd survived and moved to iowa
just an insane man in a house alone for years and years and years all of which is obfuscation
and is designed to be obfuscatory that's the whole fucking fucking that's the whole fucking point
to lay this giant slab down in front of you and go oh yeah you think something else will then refute
everything in this point by point by point i mean the whole the whole report is what like 27 000 pages
long and it tells you absolutely nothing as indeed it was designed to tell you absolutely nothing
it was simply designed to function as a counterweight so that whenever anyone dared question any part of it
this thing could be called upon as the standard reference work to fucking drub people with whether
the people doing the drubbing believed it or not yeah it doesn't really matter and most of them
statistically probably did not the the idea that the warren commission story is the be all and end all
has never particularly mattered even to the people who wrote it i really doubt alan doles wrote this
thing expecting people to believe it it it was just a fucking gateway it was just another echelon
another door you could pull shut another fucking secret exit they could get out of and americans
broadly speaking have known that it was bullshit for a long time but for a long time that was also
not taboo to say but you know there's any fucking job you ever had there's probably someone there
who would talk about jfk assassination shit if you got them started on it right but there's always
jfk assassination shit in this nonsense fucking soup of other quackery and that other quackery
dragged down the jfk stuff and because of that there was uh essentially a a you know a media omerta
against talking about anything to do with jfk or rfk or mlk or malcolm x seriously because it was
associated with this just infinite stream of you know and and also uh they had to take out the phones
in dc when kennedy died because freemasons were uh secretly melting gold under the white house
which they could then cast in the form of coins that only the illuminati are allowed to use and that
goes back to the french revolution you know you know the kind of thing i'm talking about if you're here
you've probably been in that world before well over the last a little less than a decade i would say
i have seen that shift uh i have seen it become i don't know if i can say mainstream because i don't
have much contact with the mainstream but i have seen it become acceptable political discourse to talk
seriously about who killed john kennedy and why and the why part is the part that they have really been
working on suppressing for the last 60 years they don't want you to know the sort of contentions
that were occurring at the highest possible level level of american empire in arguably its sort of
apex moment or the moment that would become uh the moment that would become the entryway to its you
know golden years of the 60s 70s 80s they don't want you to think about the function of your government
that way and suddenly people are suddenly people are discussing this in a serious way and in a way
and this is the most encouraging to me a way that doesn't reek of being assassination buffs that
shit is so fucking disgusting to me the the the necrophile jacking off over john kennedy's skull
because you're an assassination buff you're just into assassinations it has a lot in common with the
the wretched true crime wave we're going through now which by the way by the time they get a true crime to
you however they tell it to you it isn't true anymore that's not how that shit works so people
who are well out of the sort of uh the mainstream of the not mainstream i would say people who were well
off the main line of the kind of underground weirdo researcher shit are talking seriously about jfk
which has led i think to talking seriously about rfk and to looking seriously into the uh the imperial
policies of the cia things like the indonesian genocide the jakarta method uh our actions in latin america
from the 50s really till the present uh our actions in ukraine from about 2013 to ongoing
it's like a party ukraine lasts from 2013 to question marks i think people are broadly more
aware of that now than they were definitely 10 15 years ago and it is more acceptable to talk about
those things and what scares me about this rfk junior candidacy not that i think he has a particular chance
but there are a couple essential problems with it and one of them is this thing i'm talking about the
element opian on that you take one thing he is absolutely dead right about that organs of the state
murdered his father and his uncle and that is such a startling thing to hear a powerful son of wealth and
influence say in the course of a putative presidential run right and then behind that he is towing about
83 tons of complete horseshit this is a man who was uh an erstwhile environmental lawyer who is now going on
jordan peterson's show to tell us that we need less top-down regulation because the free market will fix
environmental disaster this is a man who fucking hell this saga drives me insane who first uh goes on
some talking head show to say that the u.s should model its policy along the mexican border on israel's
policy in gaza are you fucking kidding me and then uh just a few days ago i'm sure you all remember it
gets in trouble for his complete nonsense comments about uh the the covid 19 virus uh specifically
attacking caucasian and black people and sparing the chinese and ashkenazi jews and what does the
motherfucker do he talks to some odious figure of the zionist right was it rabbi shmuley was it shmuley
and in so doing in trying to polish up his image right say oh no no no i'm not some weirdo anti-semite
invokes the fact that his father his own father was a casualty of this horrible senseless war
this awful conflict between israel and palestine motherfucker motherfucker the the reason that i can't
speak for the rest of you but the reason that i started looking at bobby kennedy jr a bit more
seriously a few years ago is that he was pleading for the release of siran siran because he knew
perfectly fucking well that siran siran did not kill his father and he was uh very close to
the process of uh gotta be vague here let's just say some recent influential media that uh makes the
case quite forcefully and well and correctly that siran not only didn't kill rfk but couldn't have
killed rfk to see him drop that the moment he is accused of i don't know if it's even anti-semitism
as such it's just like schizophrenia the the idea that you could completely differentiate
eastern european jews from caucasians that that seems complex to me uh and also is not borne out
at all by the actual mortality rates of the covid virus exactly as you would expect it's people from
subjugated racial groups who died the most it's black people and latinos in the united states
white people did better than almost everybody else that he would just completely toss away
the what to me was the foundation of whatever claim to credibility he had as a public figure
it's not just disturbing in itself because if it were only that i would say oh fuck this guy
fuck him to hell never gonna listen to anything he says again never need to think about him again
but the amount of people i see who will stick with him through this kind of shit on the basis of
the idea that he is the only candidate offering a serious critique of american empire or really taking
you know the the medical industrial complex to task now this brings me to my two main points the two main
things i wanted to hammer home about this elemental pianon idea right because it's not really just about
bobby kennedy it's not just about this election it's about the entire future of the possibility of a
serious left uh a a left that comes to some kind of real grips with american fucking history a left that
acknowledges the existence and the endurance of the fourth fucking reich all right that's what i'm talking
about here and i see two glaring problems here of which rfk jr is only the momentary representative
number one i was not any kind of public figure and didn't want to be at all in the uh the run-up to the
2016 election nobody listening to this knew who i was until at least 2018 or 19 and most of you 2020 or 21
uh but you will have to take my word for it that in the run-up to that election i was absolutely
convinced that trump was going to win i i thought it was obvious that it was i mean i was walking around
feeling insane uh at being told every day this was not only impossible but laughable and uh it i think
something the way the way it snapped liberals brains when trump won it sort of snapped my brain in the opposite way
to have been right in real time about something that everyone i knew was telling me was impossible
and the reason i thought trump was gonna win is that i thought trump inaugurates a new kind of major
electoral politics and i'm not talking about you know oh the cult of personality or demagoguery or
any of that vague fucking you know i have a degree in rhetoric type shit what i'm talking about is the
inward collapse of american empire not simply in in the most literal sense in the sense of you know
the geography that we own or the nations that are completely subject to us economically because
that's not really collapsing very much but american empire in the sense of uh americans seeing themselves
as the absolute protagonists of the world and seeing nothing in the news nothing in the commentary
nothing in supposed intelligent dialogue to to uh disillusion them in in in that contention that
we are still as we have been since the end of world war ii we're the center of the fucking world hey why
not the universe and there are individual problems let's say yeah iraq didn't go so great afghanistan
hey remember afghanistan is the one that barack obama called the smart war which i will never forgive him for
i don't like dumb wars the war in afghanistan is a smart war suck my dick from the back but i think there
was this sense there is this sense um that was more germinal in in 2015-16 that we had reached or were
reaching a a sort of exponential limit we were running up against the asymptote of just how much
bullshit we could believe about ourselves and our history because that bullshit was starting to come
home in a very real way suddenly you cannot make a fucking living working one job in the united states
suddenly all the jobs in your hometown are gone all the places where you expected yeah i get a high
school diploma and i go here and i work my way up and i'm middle class no all that's fucking gone and
beyond that a level above that you think oh no i leave my hometown and then i get a diploma in something
fancy and then i become a professor somewhere nope fuck you adjunct forever no money no tenure
the the direct effects of u.s foreign policy in terms of the drug traffic and the absolute fucking
ubiquity of opiates of one kind or another since the mid-90s and you could talk about purdue pharmaceutical
and oxycontin and yeah obviously there's a lot to say there but uh you could also talk about something
we don't talk about in that connection very much namely uh 20 fucking years in afghanistan
20 years of cia proxies who are also fucking drug lords gee i wonder why they were interested in each
other and we are seeing the you know the incredible needless death of more people who aren't drug addicts
per se more people who it's it's not like they had been shooting heroin or smoking rock for 20 years or
whatever people who thought they were taking fucking ecstasy people who thought they were taking
adderall and are now dying of fentanyl overdoses and whether the american public understands that in a
systemic or causal way at all they still see it happening they still have the sense that
shit is starting to come home on us the wave has crested and is rolling back
and at that moment we had a presidential election where the premise of one side hillary's side was
that um the single most unlikable human being in the world is going to get on tv and tell you that
everything is actually fine and great we should keep doing the same things we've been doing
for the last 30 years and if if you don't think that then you are a mayo ass cracker ass mayo ass
faux white boy miss me with that bullshit all right that that was one side and bear in mind here i am not
putting any of the blame for that on the actual members of the communities hillary clinton
pretends to fucking represent hillary clinton doesn't fucking care about any of these people
there's there's some good reason to believe from the writings of people like alexander coburn
for instance that hillary clinton in her private life is racist as shit uh i'm not i am not putting
anything on the people she claimed to be protecting it's on her and the fucking party let me make that
distinction so that was the the first option and then the second option was a guy who was ludicrously
i i would say even in a way uh like exhilaratingly corrupt who was just an unappeasable unapologetic
bullshit artist for his entire life whose pitch was hey i know how to game this fucking system look at me
look at me i'm rich as hell i don't know how to do anything i've never done anything right my whole
fucking life and i'm fucking rich but beyond that i thought the real key moment was in i think it was
the first republican debate when they started with uh the standard bullshit about you know well are you
willing to defend the global war on terror as a matter of international necessity and everybody got up
there and kind of did their well i think mistakes were made but it was a necessary stuff to take the
time to ensure and then donald trump's just like the war in iraq was a big fat joke it was a joke folks
they're laughing at us and then did the same thing with nafta admitted yeah this gigantic war was a
fucking catastrophe now when he says that what he means is we spent too much money and didn't get
enough oil back but still and that this this you know post clinton era of globalized universal free
trade was fucking people over here because you know we've we've known it's been obvious it's
fucking people over everywhere else in the world and most americans frankly don't care about that
but it was fucking people over here nobody was willing to say that shit and except for someone of
course like bernie sanders who was fucking kneecapped by his own party two elections in a row and
seeing trump 2015 2016 seeing him do that it became evident to me that the the politics the electoral
politics of the immediate future of the united states are going to be about how much of the truth
a candidate can admit while having none of his or her other policies comport with that truth
can you come out and say something that we all fucking know we all know it it's not a question
it is what you would hear in any conversation with anybody in this country but politically it's
verboten can you come out on tv tv and just say yeah okay of course we all know fucking lee harvey
oswald didn't kill kennedy we all know that you think we're stupid and if you could do that as trump
proved you can harness the political energy thus created to any program anything at all and so rfk jr
scares me here in the sense that i see him as a kind of trial balloon for this policy now i am not saying
his presidential candidacy is a fucking cia operation i'm also not not saying that i don't
fucking know i mean when you look at that kind of that sort of question you have to ask yourself
basically three questions number one would they do it number two could they do it and number three
if they were going to do it is this a plausible way they would do it and um number three is looking
worse over the last couple weeks but you know it's by no means out of play but there is something that
i have come to think of as efficient will those of you who have some uh classical philosophy background
will know about the difference between first causes and efficient causes right well efficient will to me
is is a sort of a sort of volition that is no one person's that belongs to a structure efficient will
is when enough different people want the same thing to happen for their own individual reasons
that they all do their little part not necessarily thinking it will cohere into any larger structure
but then it does and i think the the efficient will of people like the cia is very much behind
someone like robert f kennedy going out and seeing if you can run a presidential campaign on the idea
that the cia killed my father and uncle and in so doing they murdered this nation in its crib
they took the infant ears of the post-war united states they slit that baby's throat
but we should do almost everything else the way we already do it free markets are going to solve climate
change that fucking frightens me uh not so much in in rfk jr's individual case but in what it portends
for the kinds of politics that are going to be harnessed to these uh very slow drips and drabs of
admissions about the past you see what i'm saying and that is directly connected to the second way
that it frightens me because in defenses of of robert kennedy jr i have seen it's all sort of well
yeah he did and said this bad shit and that bad shit and this horrible shit but he's he's the only
one talking about the cia he's the only one talking about you know imperialism you know yeah he's talking
about imperialism as in let's turn mexico into gaza but anyway you understand the idea and what is
frightening about that to me as a corollary of the first thing that's frightening is that i had hoped
that there was some sort of larger public over the last decade or so becoming aware of things like
the jfk assassination let's say not just as individual events not just as because that's how
they were always sold right even the even the non-war commission version was like oh he fucked
sam g and con his girlfriend or something like that not not as you know individual things constellated
alone in space i guess that's the opposite of what constellated means but anyway as as things that are
symptomatic of major trends and pressures things that demonstrate the internal physics of the politics of
the american empire right and the hope here for me anyway was that people would see john kennedy whatever
his many many many flaws as a casualty of american empire the same way salvador allende was the same
way patrice lumumba was not that they're equivalent political figures but that all of these people were killed
so that the same goals could be achieved by their killers and all of those goals we may wrap up under
the general heading i've been using the fourth reich right i i hoped to use kennedy or whatever else i could
have picked a number of entrance points but i think jfk is a particularly good one as the the little
secret place at the edge of the world where you can pull up the carpet and realize this is all fucking
fake the real world has been under this the whole time and instead we have this artificial
fucking sound stage full of two-dimensional flats and doors that don't open and there are cameras
overhead and there are microphones clipped inside our collars what the fuck has been going on down under
this in the real world and then i see somebody like bobby kennedy jr and he is certainly not indicative of
everyone i've ever tried to reach or talk to i hope he is indicative of very few of them
uh and this is not a shot at you listeners either if you want to vote for bobby kennedy jr
i don't really fucking care but my point is the fact that this guy is able to be taken at least
semi-seriously be taken i would say fairly seriously before his uh his most recent beautiful genius
intelligent idea was made public suggests to me that whether through a matter of actual planning
or a matter of what i am calling efficient will the people in charge have managed to sever
the idea of for example the cia killing john kennedy from any of the reasons why the cia would kill
john kennedy or any of the ramifications that murder had and have managed to flatten out this history
such that we need to tell the truth about the cia killing john kennedy why because john kennedy was
the president because he was young and handsome i guess personally yeah uh and and you know camelot and the new
frontier and no understanding at all of why any of this fucking matters and what scares me the worst about
this is not now it's not rfk jr it's not anything that's going to happen you know in this election
cycle or the next one or the next one it's the idea that they will eventually be able to let out
exactly one truth at a time to promote and backstop the worst fucking human beings and politics
on earth and i dread the day because i do think this day is coming i have through the uh the strange
contacts i have made through doing this show i have how should i put this um i've talked to at least not
known but talked to a couple people who have a sense of what sort of young cia people are like
what culture they live in what they say when they hang out together right and what i have been told
is that those people take the assassination of john kennedy as a given that it's almost like a joke
like this oh well the crazy old days when you could do anything you wanted to it it's not serious to them
at all and what i fear and what i do think is going to happen uh is that the cia at some point perhaps
in cooperation with uh some sort of political candidacy or the passage or non-passage of some law
is going to admit hey you know what yeah we did kill john kennedy we did do that but it wasn't an
agency-wide action alan doles had nothing to do with it okay it was a bunch of uh anti-castro cubans that
we were paying off and then some guys who were on the u2 spy plane project and then some ex-fbi guys
and they kind of conned oswald into taking the blame for killing kennedy and the mob was probably
involved it was a fuck up but it was a rogue cadre that's what it always is and god rogue it was a
little group that broke off from the main herd and did this and we're so so so so sorry but um
we fixed it we got rid of those people you saw us get rid of one of them on tv it was pretty famous
and uh we've never done anything like that since then so you can take our word for it that you know
we didn't do bobby we didn't do martin luther king we didn't do you know any of the i mean literally
thousands of assassinations in what used to be called the third world uh the developing world
now no no no that wasn't us of course not are you kidding and certainly we haven't been basically
joined at the hip to nazism as long as we've existed no and you can trust us because we admitted that we
fucked up with john that is a nightmare of mine because if i see that happen and i see it well received
i think that is the final moment i will know that the black iron prison the fourth reich the empire never ended
