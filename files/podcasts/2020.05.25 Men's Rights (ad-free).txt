On this season, we'll explore our most ingrained beliefs, delusions, and archetypes, the ways
that cognitive dissonance shapes our culture, and how our reality is created by the stories
we tell.
I'm your host, Chelsea Weber-Smith, and this is American Hysteria.
Well, I say that it's a very scary time for young men in America.
So, essentially, the movement believes that there's discrimination against men and not
women.
That's right.
That's me, the feminazis.
That would be the chickification of everything else.
You forced me to suffer all my life, and now I'll make you all suffer.
In the years I spent hitchhiking across America, one of the most memorable moments was the
men I met was a lonely trucker named Jimmy, who took me and my traveling buddies all the
way from the Mojave Desert to Santa Fe, New Mexico, in an enormous 18-wheeler.
We got along so well that we ended up staying at his house for the whole weekend, playing
country songs for each other.
The songs Jimmy wrote were tough, honky-tonk rock and roll, raspy, rough, and, well, manly.
But Jimmy had a secret.
One night, after a little drinking, he shyly took out a hidden box full of unmarked CDs,
and without looking at us in the eyes, he asked if he could play one of the songs he wrote
and recorded but never shared with anyone.
A sad song, he said, with a shrugging disdain for himself.
So many of the men I rode with over those years, the men I was told to fear, instead of harming
me, they told me their secrets.
They scratched their thumbnails nervously against the leather steering wheels, and sometimes they
cried, or at least their eyes grew red-ringed with a shine of tears.
With only the briefest chance at this anonymous confessional, it was as if they were desperate
to get things out, and as they talked, they transformed with a shocking ease into the little
boys they once were.
Here, in this stretch of 20 minutes, an hour, or seven, I learned a lesson over and over
again.
So many of America's men are desperately lonely and desperately sad, unable to talk about their
feelings.
You make me want to be a better man, Jimmy sang in the chorus in a deep, low voice.
And you could hear how badly he wanted to make it true.
Now, don't get me wrong here.
Out on the road like this, I was very lucky.
I've always been lucky, until, like all women, I wasn't.
For this episode, we are going to travel to the toxic depths of the men's rights movement
and involuntary celibacy internet forums where a seething hatred of women, a nauseating entitlement,
and an extreme self-loathing smolder together on message boards, a combination of ideologies
that helped produce the incel terrorists like 22-year-old Elliot Rodger.
To make sense of all this, we'll look briefly at the construction of our brand of American
masculinity and how the three waves of feminism affected the relationship between the genders,
culminating in the modern men's rights movement, both online and even in the highest levels of
political discourse that still espouses the belief that it's not men, but the feminazis,
who are the true evil oppressors at work.
And that a fight clubian return to the old manhood is the answer to their discontent.
But we'll see, too, that it hasn't always been this way.
That the first men's movement worked hand in hand with women's liberation.
In order to address the current state of these gender wars, we'll need to look not only at how
toxic masculinity continues to harm victims of its violence through cycles of anger, resentment,
and revenge, but also at the unfair demands it places on those trapped inside it,
those learning, as little boys, what it means to be a real man.
Hi. Elliot Rodger here.
You girls have never been attracted to me.
I don't know why you girls aren't attracted to me, but I will punish you all for it.
It's an injustice, a crime, because I don't know what you don't see in me.
I'm the perfect guy.
And yet you throw yourselves at all these obnoxious men instead of me, the supreme gentleman.
On May 23rd, 2014, this 22-year-old Pokemon-obsessed, designer-sunglass-wearing, narcissistic,
supervillain wannabe named Elliot Rodger recorded a bizarre final YouTube video called Retribution
from the dashboard of his black BMW before going on a shooting spree that killed six people
and injured 14.
His target was what he considered the most attractive and popular girls of a sorority,
vowing revenge on women in general who he blamed for his virginity and his unrelenting loneliness.
After pounding on the door of the sorority house and receiving no answer,
he killed two women and a man walking down the sidewalk and injured a third before he began
just shooting at random.
And then, chased by the police, he eventually committed suicide.
Immediately after the shooting, Rodger's online life took center stage,
especially his deeply embarrassing and, for lack of a better word, cringeworthy YouTube channel,
which included that final video.
He would also email out his memoir manifesto to his therapist, parents, and a few others
called My Twisted World,
in which he detailed his childhood, his teendom, and his young adult life in an excruciating 140 pages,
telling of his extremely mild humiliations, including the time he got made fun of for skateboarding.
But in addition to this narcissistic retrospective, he also details some extremely dark fantasies,
like the one about all the world's women being quarantined and starved to death in concentration camps
or used for breeding, finally accessible to men like Roger.
He writes, quote,
I would have an enormous tower built just for myself,
where I could oversee the entire concentration camp and gleefully watch them all die.
As people talk about incel, it made me wonder, you might call this a new phenomenon,
but is it really new, and is it any really different than the type of misogyny that we have seen for decades?
It's not.
It was Roger's killing spree that introduced America to incels,
a multifaceted online community who identify as involuntarily celibate,
those that want sex and relationships but seem unable to achieve that goal.
It's true that much of the incel community is not like Elliot Roger,
not like those who celebrate Elliot Roger,
and certainly not the handful of incels that would go on to copy his crimes.
But there are many who do combine a deep self-loathing with a dangerous ideology,
that they are the true nice guys, and that beautiful women owe them sex.
But instead, these Stacys, as they call them,
go for the classic archetypal teen TV trope of the dumb, mean, beefy jock
that they've nicknamed Chad Thundercock.
Elliot Roger saw Stacys as the root of all evil,
and of the pain that he and his fellow incels suffered,
simultaneously desiring and loathing the women that were promised to them
as a kind of male birthright.
These women have been cruelly dangled in front of those who identify as geeks or nerds,
or in Roger's particular brand of narcissistic hyperbole,
supreme gentlemen like himself,
that simply did not live up to the masculine standards of these sluts.
His status in life, what caused his anger, resentment, and then revenge,
like so many incels,
had been encapsulated in the creepiest early memes,
known appropriately as Rage Comics,
epitomized in one of the most famous of the last 10 years,
a disfigured face with a thin blue trickle of tears,
with the text that says,
forever alone.
So let's go back to the conquering and colonizing of America,
when white masculinity,
the kind of masculinity we'll be focusing on today
because it went on to define masculinity in general,
especially in the men's rights movement,
found its definition on the frontier,
in the strength it took to battle the indigenous,
to hunt,
to kill,
and to do all of this with as little emotion as possible.
Masculinity was based in monetary competition,
in winning,
in being the best,
and as we know,
white men did prevail and secure their place
at the top of the hierarchy,
but they were second to the rich plantation owners.
For more on that,
you can check out our Rednecks episode.
As the Civil War and the Industrial Revolution
changed everything about America,
so too it changed everything about the culture's relationship to men.
A man who would have once been his own self-sufficient machine
became a lever inside a far larger,
far more exploitive machine.
Work became monotonous,
dangerous,
grueling,
unrewarding,
and their families still lived in poverty
because the wages were terrible.
Nonetheless,
work remained an almost singular source of pride and purpose,
and as women began entering the workforce
and obtaining the right to vote,
this fragile male dignity ran even thinner,
and the hatred of feminism and women's rights burned hot,
just as it does today.
A California high school has the well-nighed perfect answer
to the president's call for physical fitness.
The boys at La Sierra are learning
that it's not only good sense to get toughened up,
it's fun.
By the beginning of the 1900s,
we see the emergence of the alpha male,
the jock,
the Chad Thundercock,
so hated by our modern incels.
These sporty boys emerged through Teddy Roosevelt,
who went from being known as a beta,
a quote,
young squirt,
and punkin' lily,
to a true man,
through the outings with other men in faraway nature,
where they'd camp,
ride horses,
rope cattle,
grab ass around,
and do other general things
that would get rid of their feminine sides,
developed through the Industrial Revolution.
For more on that,
check out our episode on quackery.
After he proved his masculinity to America
and became much more successful for it,
he made it a part of his life's work
to support football and other sports
as necessary to define true manhood
and to identify the sissies of art and education,
the weaklings,
who were seen by this newly beefy America
as geeks and nerds,
feminine,
worthless,
and gay.
And those traits were further solidified
when psychotherapy started to pathologize
and stigmatize these less-than-manly men.
In the 1930s,
on the heels of Sigmund Freud,
a psychologist and eugenicist
named Lewis Madison Terman
created something called
the Masculine Feminine Test,
or the MF Test,
a series of questions and exercises,
including Rorschach,
inkblot,
and exhaustive question-and-answer tests,
that were to determine
where a person fell
on the gender identity spectrum,
with feminine men
and masculine women
considered as potential gays,
ill-suited for marriage,
breadwinning,
and happiness in general.
I tragically could not find
and take the test myself,
but the results would have been enough
to furrow the brows
of psychotherapists and parents alike.
Here are some sample questions I found,
mostly in the true or false format.
True or false,
it is silly to let others
see your emotions.
Girls are naturally
more innocent than boys.
Brains and beauty
do not go together.
Women are purer
than men by nature.
Do you rather dislike
to take your bath?
Have you ever kept a diary?
Red goes best with
black, lavender,
pink, or purple.
By the way,
the only masculine answer
to that last question
was the color black.
If test takers scored too far
in the opposite gender's direction,
the doctors intervened,
pushing the artistic boys
to participate instead
in roughhousing with other boys,
and the tomboy girls
were made to wear frilly dresses
and disallowed from tree climbing.
Parents were expected
to continue this process,
and they became responsible
for molding their kids
in the right direction,
often using tactics of shame.
Despite their best efforts
at asserting this rugged masculinity
of yore,
by the 1950s,
the middle class began residing
largely in the safety
of the suburbs,
a feminine space,
with men stuck
in boring office jobs
that held even less masculinity
than the pre-war industrial years.
The rise of consumer capitalism
continued to define manhood
by the amount of money
a man could make,
by the comfortable life
they could provide
for an obedient,
feminine wife
and their gender-appropriate children.
But entering the 1960s,
a second wave of feminism,
known as the Women's Liberation Movement,
was becoming more and more mainstream.
And there we see
the roots of the men's rights movement
that we know today.
Originally,
what was called
the Men's Liberation Movement
was not in contest with feminism,
was not an enemy of women,
but instead allied
in a fight against
the rigid gender roles
that both identified
as the basis of their suffering.
The primary role of women
as the archetypal stay-at-home mothers
became a growing source of anger
from those women
it restricted from work,
but also for those
that felt the opposite pressure,
men who were the sole breadwinners
and weren't presented
with the cultural option
to split the cost of living
or be stay-at-home fathers themselves.
While the inherent caregiving
of the home
allowed women
a certain emotionality,
the workplace,
by design,
was an emotionless space.
But these men's Libbers
wanted deeper relationships
with their families,
wanted meaningful friendships
with other men,
and wanted to be able
to express their emotions
without being shamed.
To join the old
and new masculinity,
they headed to the woods,
of course,
sitting around campfires
and sharing emotionally
with each other.
They believed
that as they deprogrammed
society's view
of what men
were supposed to be,
it would help
women's liberation as well.
There was a great balance possible.
If women wanted to work,
then the burden
would be lessened for men.
And if men were willing
to step back from work,
women could have the freedom
to work if they wanted,
and everyone would win.
A man named Warren Farrell
was the major architect
of the men's liberation movement,
and his writing and speaking
was so appreciated
by feminists at the time
that he was asked
by the National Organization
for Women
to create more
of his men's groups,
and eventually he was invited
to join the board.
In his book,
The Liberated Man,
written from a feminist perspective,
he said that women
were certainly labeled
sex objects,
but also noted
that men were usually
considered success objects.
He became famous,
cruising through
the talk show circuit,
writing columns
for the New York Times.
He continued to express
that it was the gender roles,
this construct
that society had passed down,
that needed to be combated
by feminists
and men's libers
working together,
not as enemies,
but as a team.
Farrell and other
men's rights activists
have often pointed
to legitimate grievances,
usually around the way
America treats men
as disposable.
In some ways,
men have been disposable
in our culture,
as the majority
of blue-collar workers
in dangerous jobs,
as the majority
of fallen soldiers
in our many wars,
as those who now face
battles for custody
in court systems
that default
toward the mother,
as those who experience
higher rates
of suicide and depression,
as those living
with a lack
of emotional support
for their own
domestic abuses
and sexual assaults
that are largely unrecognized
or even made fun of.
These are valid
and important issues
to be sure,
even though the statistics
around them
are often exaggerated
by the modern MRAs.
Focusing on these oppressions,
the vulnerability-focused
men's liberation movement
grew more and more
embittered toward the volume
of feminist voices,
and the soft-spoken feminist
Warren Farrell
would turn on the very foundation
of his philosophy.
Both sexes have disappointed fantasies,
and what we've done
for the last 25 years
is I only focus on women's experience
of powerlessness.
How can you talk about
women's sense of powerlessness
and equate it with men
when there are only four women
in the Senate?
When, if you look at
the number of CEOs
in this country
who make more than $500,000 a year,
you will rarely find a woman.
There aren't many women
heading Fortune 500 companies.
During the 1970s,
the conversation
around women's rights
became largely about
the prevalence
of rape and sexual assault,
a topic that had rarely
been discussed prior.
Now, women were talking
about the everyday behaviors
of individual men,
the behaviors of the very men
who saw themselves
as in solidarity,
and this wasn't something
that these early MRAs
wanted to discuss
or be held accountable for.
This thing called feminism
was getting out of hand.
Suddenly, the question
was about sex
and the rights of women
to refuse.
Men were watching other men
be called out for their actions
individually,
and it was both scary
and infuriating.
By 1991,
Anita Hill
would formally accuse
George Bush's
Supreme Court nominee,
Clarence Thomas,
of workplace sexual harassment
before the Senate
Judiciary Committee
in a direct precursor
to the Brett Kavanaugh hearing
in September of 2018.
After a brief discussion of work,
he would turn the conversation
to a discussion
of sexual matters.
His conversations
were very vivid.
Because I was extremely
uncomfortable talking about
sex with him at all,
and particularly
in such a graphic way,
I told him
that I did not want
to talk about these subjects.
Though her testimony
ignited a Me Too-esque
social movement,
as usual,
it didn't matter much politically.
Thomas was appointed anyway
and remains on the Supreme Court
to this day,
just like Brett Kavanaugh
will for decades to come.
Nevertheless,
Anita Hill's testimony
shed a harsh light
on the plight
of everyday women
and on the actions
of men,
especially concerning
unwanted sexual advances.
Sexual advances
that masculinity in general
had told men
that they were entitled to.
And of course,
they didn't see
what the big deal was.
The Violence Against Women Act
came in 1993,
which required
the nation's law enforcement
to treat gendered violence
and things like marital rape
as crimes
and not just domestic issues,
adding legal protections
for victims of sexual assault
and expanding services
to survivors.
That same year,
Warren Farrell was back
with a much more scathing
critique of feminism,
claiming that it was women,
not men,
that now held
the majority of the power
in America
with his book called
The Myth of Male Power.
What we know
as the modern
men's rights movement
begins here,
now in direct opposition
to third-wave feminism.
Those who were focused
on the plights of masculinity
had previously sought solace
in one another,
redefining what it meant
to be a man in America
through self-reflection,
communication,
and emotional education.
Instead of working
against ingrained gender roles
for the liberation of all,
they wanted to make
masculinity great again.
The magic tablets
of their manhood
had been stolen,
and so had the things
that were promised to them
as white men at birth,
money,
supremacy,
admiration,
and sex.
Over the next 20 years,
as the internet exploded
and men could gather
in greater and greater numbers
in anonymous forums,
there would be a phasing out
of this hugging,
of this communication,
of this camaraderie,
as a new sea of men
let the sadness
of forever alone memes
turn into resentment
for women at large,
and finally,
into revenge.
On the day of retribution,
you will finally see
that I am,
in truth,
the superior one,
the true alpha male.
I'll give you
exactly
what you deserve,
all of you.
The incel culture,
of which Elliot Rodger
was a part,
is as diverse
as any subculture,
and they aren't all
vicious trolls
by a long shot.
That said,
the more radical side
of this movement
has grown substantially
over the years,
and has become
intertwined
with the alt-right,
creating a hotbed
of misogyny,
racism,
homophobia,
transphobia,
and the extreme glorification
of violence
against women,
with language
that we're mostly
going to spare you today.
They use a term
called the red pill,
a reference to the 1999 film
The Matrix,
in which Neo,
played by Keanu Reeves,
is offered two pills,
one blue,
which will allow him
to return to his previous life
in an ignorant bliss,
and one red,
which will reveal
the harsh truth
about the Matrix
that we're all living in.
Neo chooses the red pill,
and the revelations
are terrifying,
but he would rather
see it all
than be lulled
into a false reality.
MRAs see the red pill
as waking up
to the tyranny
of feminism,
to seeing their own oppression
as it really is.
By these principles,
any slights against women
are fair game.
It's a righteous fight
against the oppressor
who they believe
has all the privilege,
and most especially,
the privilege of sexual freedom,
leaving these men
without the sex
they believe
they're inherently owed.
It's that classic
cognitive dissonance
we've talked about
so many times
in which oppressive forces
psychologically
transform themselves
into victims.
After taking this
red pill,
they begin to see
toxic masculinity
as the only way
to get the sex
they deserve
from the women
they call sluts,
whores,
and far, far worse.
Those they consider
to be deserving
of rape
and even brutal murder
if they don't oblige.
Many of these
more radical incels
believe that their lack
of physical masculinity
has sidelined them away
from the shallow women
who go for these
idiot beefcakes
and ignore,
in Elliot Rogers' words,
supreme gentlemen
like him.
Surprisingly,
the first person
to coin the term
involuntarily celibate
was a woman now scared
to reveal her identity,
known only as Alana.
In 1993,
Alana found herself
very lonely
as a queer woman
in her mid-twenties,
so she started a website
called
The Involuntary
Celibacy Project
to help others
who felt like her
form intimate
and meaningful relationships,
described as
an inclusive community
for people of all genders
who were sexually deprived
due to social awkwardness,
marginalization,
or mental illness.
And originally,
that's exactly what happened.
Save for the vocal frustrations
of some men,
Alana said the website
in its original form
was a very friendly place
to express feelings
of loneliness
and to encourage conversations
around those feelings
and possibly even find romance
with other incels.
Two people who met on the site
even ended up getting married.
It wasn't until
the rampage
of Elliot Rodger
that Alana picked up
a newspaper
and saw the word
she coined
incel
being used
as a justification
for his murders,
as well as this
whole community
now steeped in rape,
assault,
and murder fantasies
that are so much worse
than you think
they could ever be,
descriptions
that will likely
stay with me
and the rest of our team
for our entire lives.
The world of this new brand
of incel
is a kind of
self-fulfilling prophecy,
one where angry men
interact daily
with other angry men,
one-upping each other
in a contest
of just who is the least
likely to ever attract
a woman
due to a lack
of financial success
that's required
by these gold diggers,
but even more often
due to an oppression
they call look-ism.
This self-perpetuating
toxic cycle
is known to psychologists
as digital self-harm.
One user posts,
quote,
candid photo of my profile
reveals my subhumanity.
I don't even leave
the house anymore.
I don't want to be seen.
One user asks
in a common thread
called Rate My Face,
what surgeries and implants
are needed to fix this?
As you can see,
I have a recessed jaw
slash chin.
And then,
the responses flood in.
Naming a slew
of the same man's
physical problems
beyond just the ones
he thought he had
and also surgical solutions.
Quote,
orthognathic surgery
if you can afford it,
chin implants
if you can't.
You should also look
at jaw angle implants.
Just as the masculine,
feminine test
of the mid-20th century stated,
A square jaw
indicates willpower.
A weak chin
represents weak character.
Since the 90s,
the rate of male
cosmetic surgeries
has tripled
as men follow
in the footsteps
of women
who've long been
victim to the pressures
of beauty standards.
And of course,
there are lots of
cultural benefits
to being attractive.
But most of the
average-looking men
who entered these forums
come out feeling
so much worse
about themselves.
But in these same forums,
women are hypocritically
reduced to their looks,
called fat, ugly,
not blonde enough,
not curvy enough,
categorized by skin color,
the way their genitals look
because of the time
they've spent
on the cock carousel.
The irony here
doesn't matter to them
because this self-hatred
is reinforced
with the opposite notion
that men,
no matter how they look,
are simply better
than the women
they want
and deserve
to look down
from their Elliot Rodgerian
towers
and see women
acting out
their most depraved fantasies
to see women
finally getting
what they deserve.
And then,
another man
one-ups them all
and posts
that women's obsession
with looks
has, quote,
driven many of us
who don't fit
their standards
to anger
and homicidal tendencies.
In the last handful
of years,
four mass murders
have been committed
in North America
by those who are involved
in the incel culture
with a total
of 45 deaths
in addition
to terror campaigns
against any woman
daring to write
about feminism
in which their
personal details
are leaked,
leading to death
and rape threats
showing up
in their email,
on their social media,
their voicemails,
and even at their
home addresses.
So,
what in the
absolute hell
is going on?
Let's look at
what I consider
to be the most
important grievance
of the men's rights
movement,
the rarely talked
about shockingly
high suicide rate
for men.
Listen to this.
77%
of the
45,000
people
who die
from suicide
every year
in the United States
are men.
Not only that,
but a recently
conducted study
that interviewed
1,500 men
ages 18 to 30
found that
one in five
had thought about
suicide
in the past
two weeks.
Through survey
questions,
the researchers
found that
those most likely
to consider suicide
were also those
who held
the strongest beliefs
about masculinity,
the need to appear
tough,
and to never talk
about their feelings.
This is the exact
reason why
so many men
don't seek help
for depression
and anxiety.
It's not easy
to go against
an entire cultural
narrative to seek
the help you need.
Psychologists have
long observed
that unexpressed
sadness
soon turns
to anger,
and anger
that is dwelled on
for a long period
of time
contorts itself
into something
far more dangerous.
resentment.
Resentment is an
obsession
with those
who the injured
party believe
to be at fault
for their pain,
and it can become
pathological,
the backdrop
to an entire
personal story,
an identity.
Then,
whatever reaction
on their part,
no matter how vile,
is deserved,
because women
are the bad ones
victimizing them
first.
Striking back
becomes noble,
and the next
stage of resentment
becomes an outward
expression of
revenge,
and Elliot Rogers'
killing spree
is applauded
by the most
radicalized
MRAs and
incels
as
the day
of retribution.
We would like
to think
that as the nation
slowly changes
the definitions
of masculinity,
the more brutal
ideology
of the MRAs
is staying
in its corners
deep in the recesses
of the internet.
But in fact,
these ideas
are still
in the highest
levels of
political conversation.
One of the
big boys
of the men's
rights movement's
most despicable
rhetoric
is none other
than the man
given the
Presidential
Medal of Freedom
by Donald Trump
in 2020,
radio host
Rush Limbaugh
of Conservative
Talk Radio,
which is basically
internet forums
for baby boomers.
The term we hear
frequently today,
feminazi,
was popularized
by Limbaugh
in 2012
when an activist
named Sandra Fluck
joined an all-male
panel of theologians
and clergy
to debate in favor
of religious colleges
providing birth control
coverage through
student health plans.
Birth control
that out-of-pocket
was very expensive
for women,
women who wanted
to practice safe sex,
but also women
who needed
birth control
for medical conditions
that require
hormonal aid.
Here's what
Limbaugh had to say
about that.
I said,
if we're paying
for this,
it makes these women
sluts,
prostitutes.
And what else
could it be?
Who bought your condoms
in junior high?
Who bought your condoms
in the sixth grade?
So Ms. Fluke
and the rest of you
feminazis,
here's the deal.
If we are going
to pay for your
contraceptives
and thus pay
for you to have sex,
we want something for it.
And I'll tell you
what it is.
We want you to post
the videos online
so we can all watch.
I'm going broke
having sex.
How did Sandra Fluck
respond?
Certainly not
in the free speech
stifling horrors
that marked
Nazi Germany
and gave feminists
their new namesake.
Quote,
We are fortunate
to live in a democracy
where everyone
is entitled
to their own opinions
regarding legitimate
policy differences.
Unfortunately,
numerous commentators
have gone far beyond
the acceptable bounds
of civil discourse.
Oh,
and she also clarified
that the use
of taxpayer money
had never been discussed.
Rush Limbaugh
believes that feminism
was, quote,
established
so as to allow
unattractive women
easier access
to the mainstream
of society.
In 2004,
when a large number
of these feminists
came out to protest
against sexual harassment,
what did Limbaugh
have to say?
Quote,
They're out there
protesting
what they actually wish
would happen
to them sometimes.
The presidential
medal
of freedom
was placed
around the neck
of this talk radio star
by a president
who's racked up
a whopping
25 accusations
of sexual assault
and harassment
since the 1970s.
A man who's implied
several times
that the women
who made those accusations
were too ugly
for him
to want to assault.
And instead,
stating that the men
and the boys
of our nation
are the ones
in real trouble.
As women came armed
with false accusations,
in the words
of Rush Limbaugh
to quote,
de-ball America,
perhaps one
of the most telling
questions
of the masculine
feminine test
is this one.
Have you ever
been unjustly punished?
If you answer yes,
that's a point
for masculinity
and the feminazis
are coming
for you too.
Perhaps the most
important film
to far-right
MRAs,
aside from
The Matrix,
is Fight Club,
the 1999
David Fincher
cult classic
adapted from
Chuck Palahniuk's
novel of the same name.
For those who may
not remember,
the basic plot
is this.
Edward Norton
plays the unnamed
narrator of the story,
essentially presented
as the classic
beta male,
accepting with a shrug
the Ikea-laden,
meaningless,
sad state
of his life.
Eventually,
he meets
alpha male
Tyler Durden,
played by a
ridiculously hot
Brad Pitt,
who lives the way
the narrator
wishes he could live,
with freedom,
reckless abandon,
and a kind of
nihilism in which
he prophylitizes
about going back
to a time
before civilization,
to a time
before industrialization,
where men
could be men
without the
feminizing aspects
that came
with that
industrial revolution.
The narrator
eventually moves
in with Durden
and starts
a transformation,
joining the
hyper-masculine
cultish group
called Fight Club,
in which men
beat each other
black and blue
to return to
some primal idea
of masculinity.
Becoming an agent
of chaos
like Tyler Durden,
the narrator
joins in
on his other club,
Project Mayhem,
with their
increasingly
transgressive
political acts
that make up
the other side
of Fight Club,
culminating in
the explosions
of several
financial institutions
that have
feminized the
modern man
through consumer
capitalism.
But how sincere
a film is this?
Is this the story
that gay author
Chuck Palahniuk
was trying to tell?
Nope.
The entire novel
is a satire
about toxic masculinity.
Before meeting
Tyler Durden,
the narrator
spends his nights
at cancer support groups
where,
although he's not
sick himself,
he would go
to listen to people
cry,
to cry himself,
to hug guys
and hear their stories.
And each night
after he attends
these groups,
his horrible insomnia
is cured
and he's finally
able to sleep.
When a woman,
another cancer
faker in the group
called Marla,
shows an interest
in the narrator,
he treats her
with disdain
and cruelty
despite his clear
desire to connect
with her.
And this is about
the point that
he meets Tyler Durden.
He pivots back
and forth
from his beta
to his alpha
Chadian persona,
ultimately fighting
with and killing
Tyler Durden
only to realize
that,
spoiler alert,
he was a figment
of his own
insomniac
imagination,
the most toxic
part of his
own masculinity
that pulled him
out of those
emotional support
groups and into
destructive chaos,
an apt metaphor
for the movement
from men's liberation
to men's rights,
from the confessional
campfires of the woods
to the cruelest
corners of the internet
where this chaotic
destruction of the self
and others
is the most valued
trait of manhood.
just like the narrator,
they've created
online alter egos
to express
the most broken
parts of themselves.
The film and book
also aptly address
the deep,
real problems
that men face,
disposability
in a nation
that's long valued
them for the money
they make.
The minuscule
income gains
of the middle
and lower classes
since the 1970s
have been nothing
if not egregious,
and it's still
a huge part
of why men
suffer disproportionate
depression and suicide.
Men are still
struggling under
this system
that they are told
defines their worth,
a system that was
created by a legacy
of other,
richer men
in a nation
where the gap
between the rich,
middle and lower
classes
continues to grow
wider.
But if we address
the MRA's
at least partially
legitimate grievances,
we can see
that it's not
feminists
who stoked
the pitfalls
of capitalism,
that called
for mass male
deaths in war,
that designed
the laws
that would make
it difficult
for men
to get custody
of their children,
that made it
unacceptable
for men
to talk publicly
about their own
sexual assaults
and their feelings
at large.
In fact,
it's been feminists
that have been
critiquing these things
and fighting
against labor
exploitation
since the early
1900s.
even now,
Alana,
the original
incel,
continues to fight
for the health
of our nation's
loneliest men,
creating a new
website called
Love Not Anger,
a project to research
how, quote,
lonely people
might find
respectful love
instead of being
stuck in anger.
But it is still
the responsibility
of men to change.
Women and non-binary
people can't do
it for them,
and many of us
are exhausted
from trying,
even scared
to keep trying.
But there are many
who do recognize
that we can work
together to change
the way that ideas
of gender
negatively affect
all of us.
There is no excuse
for the harm
that women have
endured for centuries,
and there are
certainly those
who will never
be willing to change.
And they will
suffer for it
as we march
into our
inevitable future
without them,
as their resentment
at the new,
more equal America
locks them away,
forever alone
in Elliot Rogers'
sick, strange tower.
We can fight
and fight
over statistics
and stories,
over who is to blame,
over who's the villain
and who is the victim,
and of course,
I hold my own opinions.
But I try to remember
that every one
of these men,
each and every one
of them,
started out
as a little boy.
I saw it
in the red-ringed eyes
of the men
who picked me up
hitchhiking,
their shyness,
their deep need
to share their feelings,
to connect.
The good news is
that our men and boys
are becoming
more conscious
of the toxic nature
of their own masculinity,
more willing to become
stay-at-home dads,
or at least share
the burdens
of work
and domesticity.
And psychologists
have noticed
that it's actually
leading to higher levels
of marital happiness
and lower levels
of depression
for both men
and women.
But in many cases,
the traits
of young sons
that don't fit
into the old
construct of masculinity
are strong-armed
out of them,
and they're molded
into their new identities,
identities that may not
truly be their own,
just as young men
were after taking
the masculine-feminine test
in the mid-1900s.
Elliot Rodger,
Warren Farrell,
Rush Limbaugh,
and even Donald Trump
were once staring up
at the fathers
and mothers
that believed
in these traditional
gender roles,
who stared up
at their own parents
and their own parents
before that,
who told these boys
to stop crying,
to stop hugging
other boys,
to man up,
to fight,
to treat women
as sex objects
and themselves
as success objects,
and,
most importantly,
to avoid any
and all humiliation,
whatever the cost
may be.
For much of Elliot Rodger's
bizarre manifesto,
he talks about himself
as a child,
and he somehow
seems to understand
the problem,
but misses the point.
Quote,
Boys and girls
start out the same.
We all start out innocent
and we all start out together.
Only through the experiences
and circumstances
of growing up
do we drift apart,
form allegiances,
and face each other
as enemies.
Robert Bly,
a poet
and one of the other
principal architects
of the men's liberation movement,
once said,
speaking sympathetically
of the male plight,
quote,
unless he has an enemy,
he isn't sure
that he is alive.
It's time to define
what,
not who,
the enemy
really is,
and perhaps
it's a common enemy
for both men
and women.
As Bell Hooks writes
in her sympathetic
look at men's issues
called
The Will to Change,
quote,
No man successfully
measures up
to patriarchal standards
without engaging
in an ongoing practice
of self-betrayal.
True strength,
not brute strength,
comes from no longer
betraying the self,
from being brave enough
to turn away
from inherited anger
and resentment,
to strong arm one's self
out of a cycle,
into finding the new masculinity.
It can be whatever we want,
and we get to design it together,
keeping some parts
and tossing out the others,
helping our men and boys
access the positive parts
of not only masculinity,
but of femininity
that they are entitled to as well.
That weekend in Santa Fe,
we were all there for Jimmy,
but he had to be the one
brave enough,
strong enough,
tough enough,
manly enough
to face what he was scared of,
to take a deep breath
and pull his sadness
out from its corner
to show us his loneliness.
You make me want to be
a better man,
the chorus said again,
and all us saps
got teary-eyed.
You really like it?
He asked,
his voice cracking.
We love it,
we said.
We really love it.
When we left the next day
in the early morning,
stepping out into the mist,
we turned around to see him
standing there at the door,
eyes ringed in red,
an enormous trucker
growing smaller and smaller
behind us as we walked,
until he looked to me
like a little boy.
