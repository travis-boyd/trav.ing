The End
Over the last couple weeks
Thanks to
I suppose you could most
Pithily sum it up as
Recalcitrant psychiatry
And also a tree falling
Through part of my fucking roof
But uh, that's not a metaphor by the way
Uh
But you know, let's see what the
The old
Hilne Maschine can make out of it right now
I
I wanted to, believe me
I wanted to be good
I wanted no distractions
Like every good boy should
But for
For this episode
I am going to do something that to my knowledge
I haven't done before
I'm going to read you a few passages
Of a few different documents
Uh, and I want you to sort of
Constellate them in their head
Your head
Someone's head
Uh, think about what they mean
Not just individually
But together
Alright
And these passages are a bit longer
Than things I'm accustomed to reading
On the show
But I
I hope it'll make my point
So
Passage one
From Gravity's Rainbow
And this is about
Katia Borghesius
The uh, former spy
For the anti-Nazi
Dutch resistance
Who eventually has to flee to Britain
And realizes that uh
The Allied government
Has exactly as little use for her
As a human being
As the Nazi government did
It's only a question of uh
Whom she can provide dirt upon
And how far out of their way
They're willing to go
To keep her alive
In exchange for that dirt
And so
Speaking of Katia here
She's worth nothing to them now
They were after
Schuss Stella Dre
She gave them everything else
But kept finding reasons
Not to pinpoint
The captain's rocket site
And there is too much debate by now
As to how good the reasons were
True, the site was often moved about
But she could have been placed
No closer to the decision making
It was her own
Expressionless servant's face
That leaned in over
Their schnapps and cigars
The charged coffee ringed
Across the low tables
The cream papers stamped
Purple as bruised flesh
Vim and the others
Have invested time and lives
Three Jewish families sent east
Though wait now
She's more than balanced it
Hasn't she?
In the months out at Sheffeningen
There were kids
Neurotic, lonely
Pilots and crews
They all love to talk
And she's fed back
Who knows how many reams worth
Of most secret flimsies
Across the North Sea
Hasn't she?
Squadron members
Fueling stops
Spin recovery techniques
Turning radii
Power settings
Radio channels
Sectors
Traffic patterns
Hasn't she?
What more do they want?
She asks this seriously
As if there is a real conversion factor
Between information and lives
Well, strange to say
There is
Written down in the manual
On file at the War Department
Don't forget
The real business of the war
Is buying and selling
The murdering and the violence
Are self-policing
And can be entrusted
To non-professionals
The mass nature of wartime death
Is useful in many ways
It serves as spectacle
As diversion
From the real movements
Of the war
It provides raw material
To be recorded into history
So that children
May be taught history
As sequences of violence
Battle after battle
And be more prepared
For the adult world
Best of all
Mass death
Is a stimulus
To just ordinary folks
Little fellas
To try and grab
A piece of that pie
While they're still here
To gobble it up
The true war
Is a celebration
Of markets
Organic markets
Carefully styled
Black
By the professionals
Spring up everywhere
Scrip
Sterling
Reichsmarks
Continue to move
Severe as classical ballet
Inside their antiseptic
Marble chambers
But out here
Down among the people
The truer currencies
Come into being
So
Jews are negotiable
Every bit as negotiable
As cigarettes
Cunt
Or Hershey bars
And then
A little flashback
Right
To how Katya got on
During the war
At the images
She sees in the mirror
Katya can also feel
A cameraman's pleasure
But knows what he cannot
That inside herself
Enclosed in the
Soignier surface
Of deer fabric
And dead cells
She is corruption
And ashes
She belongs in a way
None of them can guess
Cruelly
To the oven
To Der Kinderofen
Remembering now
His teeth
Long
Terrible
Veined with bright brown rot
As he speaks these words
The yellow teeth
Of Captain Bleachero
The network of stained cracks
And back in his night breath
In the dark oven
Of himself
Always the coiled
Whispers of decay
She recalls his teeth
Before any other feature
Teeth were to benefit
Most directly
From the oven
From what is planned
For her
And for Gottfried
He never uttered it
Clearly as threat
Nor ever addressed
To either of them
Directly
But rather
Across her train
Satin thighs
To the evening's guests
Or down the length
Of Gottfried's
Docile spine
The Rome-Berlin axis
He called it the night
The Italian came
And they were all
In the round bed
Captain Bleachero
Plugged into
Gottfried's
Upended asshole
And the Italian
At the same time
Into his pretty mouth
Caccia only passive
Bound and gagged
And false eyelashed
Serving tonight
As human pillow
For the Italian's
Whitening perfumed curls
Roses and fat
Just at the edge
Of turning rancid
Each utterance
A closed flower
Capable of exfoliation
And infinite revealing
She thinks of
A mathematical function
That will expand
For her bloom-like
Into a power series
With no general term
Endlessly darkly
Though never completely
By surprise
His phrase
Padre Ignacio
Unfolding into
Spanish Inquisitor
Black robes
Brown arching nose
The suffocating smell
Of incense
Plus
Confessioner
Executor
Plus
Katia and
Gottfried
Both kneeling
Side by side
In dark confessional
Plus
Children
Out of old
Merchen
Kneeling
Knees cold
And aching
Before the oven
Whispering it
Whispering to it
Secrets
That they can
Tell no one else
Plus
Captain Blichero's
Witch paranoia
Suspecting them both
Katia despite
Her NSB credentials
Plus
The oven
As listener
Avenger
Plus
Katia kneeling
Before Blichero
In highest drag
Black velvet
And Cuban heels
His penis
Squashed invisible
Under a flesh-colored
Leather jock strap
Over which he wears
A false cunt
And merken
Of sable
Both handcrafted
In Berlin
By the notorious
Madame Ophir
The mock labia
And bright purple
Clitoris
Molded of
Madame
Had been abject
Pleading shortages
Synthetic rubber
Synthetic rubber
And Mipolam
The new polyvinyl
Chloride
Tiny blades
Of stainless steel
Bristle from
Lifelike pink
Humidity
Hundreds of them
Against which
Katia
Kneeling
Is obliged to
Cut her lips
And tongue
And then kiss
Blood abstracts
Across the golden
Ungessoed back
Of her
Quote unquote
Brother
Gottfried
Brother in play
Brother in slavery
She had never
Seen him before
Coming to the
Requisition house
Near the firing
Sites
Hidden in the
Woods and parkland
Of this settled
Tongue of small
Farms and estates
That reaches
Eastward toward
The royal city
Between two
Expanses of
Polder
Toward
Wassenaar
Yet his face
For that first
Time
Seen in autumn
Sunlight
Through the
Great west
Window of the
Drawing room
Kneeling naked
Except for a
Studded dog
Collar
Masturbating
Metronomic
At shouted
Commands
From Captain
Bleachero
All his fair
Skin stained
By afternoon
A luminous
Synthetic
Orange
She has never
Before associated
With skin
His penis
A blood
Monolith
Its thickly
Gasping mouth
Audible
In the carpeted
Silence
His face
Raised to
None of them
But as if
To something
On the ceiling
Or in the sky
Which ceilings
May in his
Vision stand
For
Eyes down
As he seems
Most of the
Time to be
His face
Ascending
Tightening
Coming
Is so close
To what she's
Been seeing
All her life
In mirrors
Her own
Studied
Mannequin
Stare
That she
Catches
Her breath
Feels for a
Moment
The speeded
Percussion
Of her
Heart
Before turning
Just such a
Stare
Toward
Blichero
He is
Delighted
Perhaps
He tells
Her
I will
Cut your
Hair
He smiles
At Gottfried
Perhaps
I'll have
Him grow
His
The humiliation
Would be good
For the boy
Each morning
At quarters
Ranked with
His battery
Near
Schuss
Stelletray
Where horses
Thundered once
Before the
Frantic
The losing
Railbirds
Of the old
Peace
Failing
Inspections
Time after
Time
Yet protected
By his
Captain
From army
Discipline
Instead
Between firings
Day or night
Short of sleep
Odd hours
Suffering the
Captain's
Own
Hex's
Sucked
But did
Blichero
Also cut
Her hair
She can't
Remember now
She knows
She wore
Gottfried's
Uniforms
Once or
Trice
Pushing her
Hair
Yes up
Under his
Forage cap
Looking easily
His double
Spending these
Nights in
The cage
As Blichero
Has set
The rules
While
Gottfried
Must wear
Her silk
Stockings
Her lace
Apron
And cap
All her
Satin
And ribboned
Organdy
But afterward
He must
Always go
Back again
To the
Cage
That's how
It is
Their captain
Allows no
Doubt as
To which
Brother or
Sister
Really is
Maidservant
And which
The fattening
Goose
How seriously
Is she
Playing
In a
Conquered
Country
One's
Own
Occupied
Country
It's better
She believes
To enter
Into some
Formal
Rationalized
Version
Of what
Outside
Proceeds
Without
Form
Or
Decent
Limit
Day
And
Night
The
Summary
Executions
The
Roustings
Beating
Subterfuge
Paranoia
Shame
Though it
Is never
Discussed
Among them
Openly
It would
Seem
Katja
Gottfried
And
Captain
Blichero
Have agreed
That this
Northern
And ancient
Form
One they
All know
And are
Comfortable
With
The
Strayed
Children
The
Wood
Wife
In the
Edible
House
The
Captivity
The
Fattening
The
Oven
Shall
Be
Their
Preserving
Routine
Their
Shelter
Against
What
Outside
None
Of
Them
Can
Bear
The
War
The
Absolute
Rule
Of
Chance
Their
Own
Pitiable
Conting
Contingency
In
It's
Miss
And
Lest
Any
Of
That
Seem
Baroque
Or
Perverse
Or
Merely
Overcooked
You know
The
Product
Of
A
Slightly
Malarial
Imagination
On
Thomas
Pinchon's
Part
The
Third
Thing
I
Want
To
Read
You
Is
A
Very
Brief
Very
Terse
Exchange
Between
Two
People
And
The
First
Of
These
People
Is
A
Man
Named
Jess
Staley
Jess
Staley
Was
One
Of
The
Top
Executives
At
JP
Morgan
For
Years
And
Years
Until
He
Was
Suddenly
Dismissed
And
Replaced
For
No
Reason
That
Anybody
Made
Public
At
The
Time
And
Then
Jess
Staley
Moved
On
To
Barclays
Another
Gigantic
Financial
Firm
As
In
Barclays
Bank
The
Barclays
Center
In
Brooklyn
So
On
So
On
Where
He
Worked
Until
2020
Until
He
Was
Again
Dismissed
For
Reasons
That
Nobody
Wanted
To
Talk
About
And
This
Email
Exchange
Is
Between
Staley
And
The
Client
With
Whom
He
Worked
Perhaps
The
Most
Closely
During
His
Time
In
High
Finance
So
Jess
Staley
Writes
That
Was
Fun
Say
Hi
To
Snow
White
For
Me
His
Interlocutor
Responds
What
Character
Would
You
Like
Next
That
Interlocutor
The
Man
Making
The
Response
That
That's
Jeffrey
Epstein
And
To
The
Question
What
Character
Would
You
Like
Next
Staley
Writes
Beauty
In
The
Beast
And
This
Exchange
Would
Be
Horrifying
For
Any
Number
Of
Reasons
Horrifying
In
Whatever
Particular
Person
Or
Persons
It
Applies
To
Whatever
Particular
Events
It
Makes
Reference
To
Or
Indeed
Requests
To
Happen
In
The
Future
But
I
Want
You
To
Notice
Something
About
The
Tone
And
The
Grammar
Here
Right
That
If
Jeffrey
Epstein
Were
Uncomfortable
If
He
Felt
Any
Need
To
Hide
What
He
Did
If
There
Were
Any
Widowed
Relic
Of
Shame
Or
Self
Hatred
About
The
Way
He
Makes
His
Living
If
Someone
Like
Jez
Staley
Wrote
To
Him
And
Said
That
Was
Fun
Say
Hi
To
Snow
White
Jeffrey
Epstein
Would
Write
Back
As
Quickly
As
Possible
I
Don't
Know
What
The
Fuck
You
Are
Talking
About
I
Don't
Know
Who
The
Fuck
You
Are
Never
Speak
To
Me
Again
Jeffrey
Epstein
If
He
Thought
There
Was
Any
Chance
Of
Any
Of
This
Going
Wrong
If
He
Thought
There
Was
Any
Actual
Chance
Of
Facing
Repercussions
Would
Try
To
Make
That
Message
Look
Like
It
Was
Sent
Either
In
Error
Or
To
Someone
Who
Had
Grossly
Misinterpreted
The
Nature
Of
The
Services
He
Could
Provide
Of
Course
Since
Jeffrey
Epstein's
Cover
Story
Was
Being
In
The
Finance
World
In
Some
Way
Doesn't
Really
Make
A
Whole
Lot
Of
Sense
That
Someone
From
J.P.
Morgan
Chase
And
The
Top
Fucking
Management
Echelon
Would
Be
Going
To
Ask
Him
For
Advice
Now
Does
It
But
Then
It
Also
Doesn't
Really
Make
Sense
That
Someone
Like
Leon
Black
Of
Apollo
Global
Management
Would
Give
Jeffrey
Epstein
150
Million
Fucking
Dollars
Over
A
Decade
And
Then
Claim
That
It
Was
For
Tax
Advice
A
Man
Like
Leon
Black
One
Of
The
Richest
Private
Equity
Entrepreneurs
And
Fucking
Scumbag
Thieves
In
This
Country
And
Indeed
In
The
History
Of
The
World
For
What
He
Does
A
Man
Who's
Living
Is
Essentially
Making
Up
A
Bunch
Of
Fake
Debt
Which
Is
To
Say
Fake
Money
On
His
Part
To
Buy
A
Company
And
Then
Transferring
That
Debt
To
The
Company
So
He
Can
Sell
Off
The
Company
Piece
By
Piece
To
Appease
His
Own
Creditors
And
Skim
A
Massive
Profit
At
The
Top
Until
The
Company
He
Has
Purchased
Ceases
To
Exist
The
Same
Way
All
These
Motherfuckers
Like
Mitt
Romney
And
Michael
Milken
And
Ranieri
And
Pelts
All
Those
People
This
Is
A
Man
Leon
Black
Who
Would
Have
Had
At
His
Beck
And
Call
Any
Moment
Of
Any
Day
24
7
The
Most
Convoluted
Tortuous
Technically
A word
Here
And
A word
There
Actually
This
Law
Doesn't
Quite
Say
That
Sort
Of
Tax
Advice
Anyone
On
Earth
Could
Ever
Ask
For
And
If
A man
Like
Jeffrey
Epstein
Came
To
Him
Which
Of
Course
This
Didn't
Happen
But
Let's
Just
Say
A man
Like
Jeffrey
Epstein
Comes
To
Him
Saying
I
Can
Give
You
Tax
Advice
Then
It
Would
Also
Be
Incredibly
Easy
Almost
Effortless
In fact
For
A guy
Like
Leon
Black
To
Get
In
Touch
With
Any
Of
The
Thousands
And
Thousands
And
Thousands
Of
People
He
Knew
At
The
Uppermost
Line
Of
Of
Not
Just
Finance
But
Of
The
Financialization
Industry
And
To
Ask
Who
The
Fuck
Is
This
Guy
Jeffrey
Epstein
And
If
He
Had
Done
That
The
Reports
He
Would
Have
Gotten
Would
Have
Been
Along
The
Lines
Of
I
Don't
Know
There's
Something
Real
Weird
Going
On
Here
He
Claims
He
Owns
A
Hedge
Fund
But
It
Appears
To
Have
Only
One
Client
It's
Never
Published
Any
Sort
Of
Results
Or
Algorithms
Or
Or
Client
Lists
And
The
Guy
Who
Was
It's
One
Client
Also
Appears
To
Have
Given
Epstein
Like
Hundreds
Of
Millions
Of
Dollars
In
The
90s
And
Also
One
Of
The
Most
Expensive
Houses
In
New
York
City
And
Actually
He's
Not
Only
Did
He
Not
Go
To
Wharton
Or
Yale
Or
Something
He
Never
Finished
College
Which
Is
Weird
Because
He
Then
Became
A
Teacher
At
Arguably
The
Most
Prestigious
Private
High
School
In
New
York
City
But
There
Is
No
Evidence
Of
Any
Kind
That
This
Guy
Knows
A
Fucking
Thing
About
Finance
At
All
In
Any
Direction
In
Fact
The
One
Time
He
Worked
Directly
And
Certifiably
Documentably
In
The
Financial
Sector
He
Almost
Immediately
Got
Busted
For
Running
A
Giant
Ponzi
Scheme
Except
When
This Ponzi
Scheme
Went
To
Trial
Somehow
The
Other
Guy
In
The
Scheme
Confessed
To
Everything
And
Not
Only
Was
Epstein
Not
Charged
Not
Found
Guilty
Not
Sentenced
He
Wasn't
Even
Mentioned
In
The
Trial
Over
This
Scheme
So
I
Don't
Know
Who
This
Fucking
Guy
Is
But
I'm
Thinking
A
Pretty
Good
Idea
To
Stay
Away
From
Him
Right
This
Is
The
Sort
Of
Information
That
A
Guy
Like
Jez
Staley
Could
Have
Had
About
Jeffrey
Epstein
Any
Moment
Of
The
Day
Just
Like
Leon
Black
And
Yet
We
Have
Him
In
These
Emails
Openly
Alluding
To
The
Fun
He
Had
With
Snow
White
And
The
Fun
He
Expects
To
Have
In
Future
With
Beauty
And
The
Beast
And
I
Know
Look
The
Details
Of
This
Case
Such
As
We
Have
Them
Are
Not
Are
Not
Going
To
Be
Surprising
Or
Shocking
To
Any
Of
You
I
Don't
Think
At
This
Point
But
Seeing
Seeing
That
Series
Of
Emails
Really
Catalyzed
Something
In
Me
Really
Gave
Me
This
Vomit
Crawling
Up
Your
Throat
Feeling
And
Not
Just
Because
They're
Abjectly
Fucking
Disgusting
And
What
I
Mean
I
Think
Quite
Clearly
Here
What
These
People
Are
Talking
About
Is
Raping
Underage
Girls
Let's
Make
No
Mistake
About
That
But
What
It
Means
For
These
Men
And
Not
Just
These
Men
But
The
Trafficked
Underage
Girls
They're
Talking
About
To
Be
Put
In
These
Scenarios
Snow
White
Beauty
And
The
Beast
What
The
Fuck
Is
Going
On
Here
And
I
Think
Unfortunately
For
My
Own
Sanity
It
Is
Something
Much
Deeper
And
More
Profound
And
More
Frightening
Than
Just
Slang
Or
Catch
Words
Or
Even
Some
Jungian
Archetypal
Shit
Certainly
There
Are
Archetypes
Obviously
There
Are
Archetypes
But
Equally
Obviously
Those
Archetypes
Are
Learned
They
Are
Not
Matters
Of
Infinite
Genetic
Inheritance
Alive
In
The
Brain
Stem
Identically
Of
Every
Human
Being
You
Know
It's
Important
To
Remember
Of
Carl
Jung
As
Of
Sigmund
Freud
That
Pretty
Much
All
Their
Clientele
Was
You
Know
Upper
Middle
To
Very
Upper
Class
Viennese
People
Who
Spent
All
Of
Their
Time
Signing
Papers
In
Mahogany
Rooms
With
No
Windows
I
Mean
No
No
Wonder
They
Thought
These
Guys
All
Have
The
Same
Basic
Mental
Structure
And
The
Same
Essential
Problems
Because
They
Were
All
Kind
Of
The
Same
Fucking
Person
So
When
I
Talk
About
Archetypes
Here
And
Hence
Forth
I
Am
Not
Talking
About
Anything
To
Do
With
Jungian
Archetypes
That
Is
Not
What
I
Mean
I
Am
Talking
About
An
Archetype
As
A
Recognized
Sort
Of
Role
Into
Which
You
Can
Insert
Yourself
Into
A
Social
Formation
Which
You
Hope
Will
Guarantee
At
Best
You
Know
Success
But
We
All
Know
That
Is
Rare
So
If
Nothing
Else
Hopefully
Some
Degree
Of
Safety
And
Some
Degree
Of
Service
Let's
Call
It
Of
Use
Value
To
The
People
Who
Actually
Run
The
World
And
I
Want
To
Be
Very
Clear
Before
I
Explain
What
I'm
Talking
About
Here
I
Am
Not
Of
Matter
Worth
Of
colo
Of
Girl
pedophile and sexual blackmailer, not to mention arms dealer and possible drug runner as well.
The absolutely off-the-cuff language he uses to talk about raping child slaves with a man who was
at the time one of the very topmost executives at what I believe is still the largest financial
institution in the United States, JPMorgan Chase. These were people who clearly felt that there was
no need to hide anything they were talking about. There was no need to put any of this in a coded
language to make it more difficult in case papers like these were subpoenaed at some point, for
example, because they thought and thought rightly, look, if this ever comes out, one of two things is
going to happen. Either we're going to be dead in Epstein's case, or we will have burrowed our way
tick-like so deep into the flesh of whatever system would seek to punish us, would seek to retaliate
against us. We will have exercised such a complete degree of regulatory capture over anyone who would
try to stand against us that it doesn't really matter. People can see these papers, they can be
disgusted by them, they can be overwhelmed, they can find them nightmarish, all of which fucking
happened to me today. You know, I was not planning to do a show about this today, but that phrase,
beauty and the beast will not leave me the fuck alone since I read it. They knew, like, look, yeah,
okay, maybe these will come out, and yeah, okay, I'll look bad for a couple weeks. Great. I also have
the combined fortune and pension and healthcare plans and stock portfolio and residential properties
of a guy who was a top-ranking J.P. Morgan and then Barclays executive for decades. It's not really
gonna change my life at all. I'm not going to jail over this shit. Nobody can prove that's what I'm
talking about, right? We all know that it is. It's really as obvious as it could be, but no one can
prove it to the standard of, you know, courtroom evidence, so fuck it. Who cares? And I think the
nonchalance of that language reflects a number of very terrible and troubling things that I have not
seen, I guess I would sort of say, annexed to the larger Epstein narrative very much.
One of those things is that I think people presume this in general, and they're right to,
but I don't think they have an idea of the scale of it. There are so many more Jeffrey Epsteins
than Jeffrey Epstein. There are so, so, so many more of them, and I would tell you what I'm talking
about in detail, and maybe someday I will be able to do that. At the moment, it would risk really
fucking up the life of somebody I care about, and so I'm not willing to risk that right now,
but I hope there will be a time, and not for my sake, but for the sake of the person I care about,
I hope there will be a time when both of us can say everything we know about this kind of thing,
but as this language would tend to imply between these two figures of, you know, fairly monumental
power and importance and wealth, this was not an occasional weird, you know, a freak behavior. This
wasn't, you know, every couple, every couple years, man, I just gotta go down to Little St. James
and fucking let loose. I gotta, you know, fucking drink my bottle of ranch and investigate 311.
No, no, no, no, no. Everybody knew what the fuck was going on here. Every one of them did.
And what strikes me with the most horror other than that is the fact of the use of fairy tale
characters for this guy Staley describing what he wants from Epstein, and then putting that up against
the passage I read, the end of the passage I read about Katya in Gravity's Rainbow. Katya is securing her
safety, at least briefly, by being the sort of like, S&M kind of, what would the word be? Not, not exactly,
not housemaiden, not, the sort of essentially toy, the female toy that this insane Nazi, Blichero,
who, by the way, at the end of the book is, um, quite, quite clearly explicated not to have died
in World War II, and when, uh, Pinchon, uh, when he rhetorically asks, where can we find
this man, Blichero, now that World War II is over? He says, look in the United States and look high,
not low. That's about explicit as it gets, um, but Katya secures her survival and her ability,
for a time anyway, to feed information to the allies that should damage the Nazis by being the,
the female play thing in these sort of bizarre sadomasochistic rituals that Blichero, who's,
that is his title, as it were, his name is, uh, Lieutenant Weissmann, uh, enjoys acting out,
right? And that phrase near the end of the second passage I read, how seriously is she playing?
In a conquered country, one's own occupied country, it's better, she believes, to enter into some formal,
rationalized version of what outside proceeds without form or decent limit, day and night.
And one of the things you will know, um, if you've heard many of my episodes about Pinchon before,
that I have emphasized is the idea that this book, Gravity's Rainbow, it takes place both in the 40s and
the 60s. There is endless parallelism between the two eras, from really obvious things, uh, like the
actual appearance of, of Richard Nixon, and the mention of the Bobby Kennedy assassination near the
book, to less obvious things like the, um, the entire existence of the white visitation, you know, the,
the, the psyops unit in London, and all the, uh, the sodium amytol tests on Slothrop as a, uh, precursor,
both, you know, historically true and, uh, purposively true, true in terms of their use value to programs like
MKUltra. You know, it was only a few years after the events depicted in this book that take place during World War II
happened, that in the MKUltra program was founded on the basis of, uh, propagandistic bullshit about,
you know, Chinese and North Korean brainwashing, which we then, and instead of, uh, you know, just
sort of letting it drop after the wars were over, decided to take as, as a principle toward which we
should be reaching. That, yeah, sure, even though we know we made up all that shit about communist Chinese
brainwashing, what if you could brainwash people though? What if that actually worked? And from that
plan, we get Frank Olson flying out of a window, we get the Manson killings, we get almost certainly
the fact that Sirhan Sirhan is still in fucking prison for never having shot anyone in his life.
And, and this passage about, uh, electing to engage in a horrible situation within the midst of a larger
horrible situation, because at least in that microcosmic version, there are rules. At least you
know what's happening and why to some degree, and you are able to gain some sense of the forces at play,
what sort of leverage they have against each other, which one out rules another one. Well,
that sounds to me in a way, I don't know if Pinchon even could have meant by the, uh, you know,
beginning of the seventies, although surely he was seeing it happen. This sounds to me like what I
have held for a long time now from, uh, what was it, a paper I wrote in like 2011 or something,
uh, that we have entered not fundamentally an entirely new stage of capitalism, but that we have
given, uh, wretched birth to a new sort of scission or subdivision within capital, which is to say that,
um, what I called identity capital is now in certain parts of the world and particularly,
you know, the first world or the most developed nations or whatever you want to call them.
Personally, I know, I know people don't like, you know, first, second, third world for the,
the hierarchy that it, uh, implies, but, uh, saying most developed nations makes me feel pretty
fucking sick too. Cause I, I look at, you know, nations with less of an industrial base than the
United States or less of a knowledge economy, a learning economy. I look at those places and I
don't, I don't see less developed people. I don't see a country that's less developed. I see a country
that hasn't gone insane in the same fucking way we have, but don't worry, we'll get them there.
Um, anyway, point is in these more developed countries or whatever you like to call them,
there has been for a long time now. And I think especially since the late sixties onward,
which is of course when Pinchon is writing a lot of the bulk of this book, there has been a shift,
uh, in terms of, well, it's the same shift I've talked about, uh, probably dozens, if not hundreds
of times on this show, the shift from politics having to do with the actual economic and structural
composition of the state and the areas in which the state is beholden to its own citizens, the
minimum services that the state has to provide to be worthy of the name state at all. There's been a
violent shift away from all of that. Thanks in part to deindustrialization and Jimmy Carter caving
into the finance industry. And then Ronald Reagan, but not so much caving into the finance industry as a
eagerly offering himself for the financing industry to run a train on him for eight years to, of course,
Bush to, of course, Clinton, whose great innovation is to make, you know, being a Democrat in 1992,
the same thing as being a fucking Republican in 1976. And then the nightmare of the Bush years,
then Obama, you don't need me to explain all that again. The point is as politics as such in the public
sphere has ceased to exist as we have been given essentially an idiot game show that we think is
politics to distract us from the actual substance of politics. Then in the same way and by inversion,
the politics we do actually practice are not presented to us as politics. They are presented to us as
personality, as identity, as forms of not only recognizing oneself, but using the, you know,
endless narcissistic solipsism of self-projection, not just to say I am one of type A and therefore I
should associate with, or even perhaps be, you know, the, the leading exemplar of type A. No, it's,
it's a far deeper brain rot than that. It is that, and, and I say this, you know, having observed it
up close for a long fucking time now, um, it's not just I am type A, therefore other type A's,
acknowledge me, praise me, I will praise you. Sure, there's some of that, but it goes beyond that to the,
the real terrifying definition of the word solipsism. Because people know solipsistic as an insult,
as well it should be, you know, the, I, most of the time that's what it means. But solipsism at root,
you know, sol ipse, only this, this alone. Solipsism is, uh, it often ends up being monstrous
in any kind of political or, or social production because it is born of the absolute horror that you
are actually the only one alive. That there is really no one else like you. And so, in order to gain
any sort of social, political, economic purchase, in, in order to carve out a role, whatever that role may
be, you have to aggregate all of the synthetic quasi-use, you know, all, all of the, the false, uh, type A's
into your own solipsistic self-image in which they, you see them as yourself and they also wish to see
themselves as you. Cause it's not always two ways, right? It's two ways on the bottom fucking rungs.
It's two ways and people in, you know, shitty little fucking indie rock scenes in college towns
or whatever. But the nature of celebrity now is largely something that has changed, um, from the
admiration, I think, of people who get attention in one way or another, whether it's having unique,
having a unique skill or being good looking or having done something impressive, whatever,
we're past all that now. We are now into this phase of identity capital in which the primary purpose of
celebrity is to, uh, is to enable the fluctuation is to turn on the currency flows of identity capital
so that all of these, you know, and I don't, again, I don't mean this in the insulting, uh,
sense of the word, all of these solipsists wandering this miserable fucking country who are fixated on the
very understandable idea that they are absolutely alone, that not only will no one else ever understand
them, no one else will ever know what they're thinking. No one else will ever know what they're
feeling, which is not an unreasonable thing to be afraid of, right? Not only is that all true,
but because they don't have a reflection anywhere, they have no way to observe themselves either.
And so it's not just no one gets me. It's also, I don't get me because there's nothing outside myself
to use for fucking contrast. It's that there, there is no scale of measurement other than my own.
And I made my own up so it could mean anything. And thus, I think the purpose of celebrity ceases to be,
you know, what it has been, I think, at least in, in this country, in the Western world for most of
the last hundred years, whatever you want to call it. And it's importance now lies in producing, uh,
synthetic archetypes. Uh, the, you know, to sort of circle back to the, the stupidest possible version
of the Jungian thing, because it is stupid at this level. Something being stupid, unfortunately, does not
make it incorrect. Uh, we have to go back and invent all of these synthetic archetypes. And of course, part of the
definition of an archetype in theory is that it's not synthetic. It can't be invented, but oh, well,
we kicked that shit to the side years ago. And we have to convince people that there is a niche that
they fall into, right? There is a type for them. There is a, a taste public. There is target marketing
for them. There is a part of this world that is meant for them and them only. And not only should
they glory in the fact that this part of the world is meant for them, they should also defend it
violently if necessary from interlopers. You know, you, you are seeing a sort of, with the way celebrity
and, and I think loneliness and the, the alchemy between those two of creating the synthetic
archetype, uh, persists. I think you are seeing a sort of inversion of the holistic order of say
the middle age, middle ages, I should say, uh, peasant Catholic. And that these were people with,
you know, by and large, by almost any standards, awful lives. And yet to some extent, anyway,
when they, you know, weren't, uh, on one of their occasional trips of taking up arms against the
landlord, uh, these were people who were able to not only bear that situation, but in some ways
celebrate and even thank God for that situation. Because however miserable their misery was,
they saw it as an ineffable and inextricable part of all these concentric wheels of the universe
moving together. That God was essentially, I mean, you have it pictured in Dante's Paradiso.
God is an infinitely dense point of light at the center of the universe, which is by the way,
pretty fucking good for a guy who was writing in the 1300s. We didn't know about the big bang then,
but he got it. Um, God is this infinitely dense point of light in the center of all things and all
other things radiate around him in, in rings essentially in orbits. And so if you believe
in that kind of genuinely holistic and analogistic worldview, and when I say analogistic, I mean the
idea that, uh, although this often produced, you know, awful results in practice in the main, I think
it's a pretty correct idea, which is that, you know, the hermetic, the hermetic idea as above, so below
as within, so without that you can understand a lot about anything by understanding a little about
anything else. You will see the same patterns, the same biological structures. And I mean, biological
in the, you know, the largest possible sense from, from the, the construction of a, you know, one of
the arms of a spiral galaxy to the pattern of veins in a leaf. These things are recurrent. They work at
both the smallest and the largest conceivable levels. And so even if your own life is absolutely
unmitigated horror, you can take solace in the fact that the horror of that life is a necessary part
of the cosmic balance that will eventually bring about the glory of God, essentially.
Okay. Well now move up, you know, 800,000 years, whatever, and subtract God from all of it.
And in the place of God, uh, as essentially a form of currency, because of course God has always been
that too, put in identity and not even necessarily your identity. There doesn't even necessarily have to
be a, uh, a hardcore aspect of ownership here because most of the time what you are buying is,
um, it's a, what's the word I'm looking for? A piaculum. You are buying something sacrificially.
You make a sacrificial purchase that is by giving away both money, the shit that keeps you alive
and whatever part of yourself you can stand to wager on this act of faith, right? You make your purchase
and the piaculum you give the, you know, the, uh, transmutative sacrificial material,
its goal is to absorb you into the greater clan, you know, the greater hive, the greater segment
of whatever sort of, um, I guess I would call it a fractional oversoul is represented by anything,
anything from the fucking, you know, USAF commercials to Rihanna to fucking, uh, Silicon Valley
life extension to the belief that a bunch of guys doing algorithms in a fucking warehouse in Ohio
are going to figure out how every baseball team should play every game on every day for the rest of
time. It doesn't really matter the what it is that all personal action becomes this, uh, I only know
this word because of T.S. Elliot, this piaculative purchase in which you are essentially sacrificing
part of your own wellbeing and your own shattered sense of self. You, you are sacrificing not only
wellbeing in, in material terms, right? But wellbeing in the sense that you have the structure of a self
sort of the bits and pieces are kicking around in there, but it is the, the sacrificial, the piaculative
act that you hope will transmute you into part of this, this, uh, larger, not holistic, obviously,
because it's not the entirety, but this, this sort of limited kind of, you know, holistic cosmicism
with some sort of celebrity or, or, um, religion still sometimes, but not the way any of our ancestors
would have known it or industry or a movement, whatever the fuck that means in music or film or
whatever. And inevitably when, when that kind of capital circulates in the field of identity, um, a number
of things happen. And one of them is that we start building this new set of archetypes, right? Which of
course they draw enormously from the old ones, how could they not, you know, we've been dealing with,
you know, some of the same basic roles and personages for as long as we've known anything
about human society, but some of them aren't. And then there is the class divide between the person
trying to get into this and the person who controls it. And this is where things get very fucking ugly
indeed, because like Katya in gravity's rainbow, a lot of people will try to arrange themselves
in these sort of, you know, these broken totalities, these fractured whole isms, because
as bitter and false and ultimately disappointing as those broken totalities may be, still they are at
least some kind of shelter to, you know, as Pinchon says, uh, what, what proceeds outside without form or
decent limit day and night, the chaos of having nothing of having nowhere to hide. And so that suits us,
you know, well, I was going to say suits us fine here on the ground. Actually, it doesn't suit us
fine at all. Actually, it's, it's fucking species-wide suicide, but, um, a lot of people, and again,
this is not to criticize them, have nothing other than that and will never be offered anything other
than that. And then I see Jeffrey Epstein and Jez Staley talking about Snow White and Beauty and the Beast.
And it was something I knew before. It's not like this has ever been, um, you know, forbidden knowledge
to me. It's not like the abstraction of it was shocking, but something about seeing it in those
exact fucking words, that was fun, say hi to Snow White for me, made something click violently into place,
which is that though we out here in fucking consumer land, whose only form of, you know,
self-identification, self-hood, um, concept of a reason to live, concept of what life is,
we, we attain most of that by purchasing the sort of what we hope will be structural niche,
where we are going to share in the, the beatified, the sanctified versions of whatever we wish we were.
You know, we, you, you pick your field, you pick your person, you pick whoever it is that you think,
I'm just like her, but no one understands me, or I'm just like him, but people don't know it.
And you try to buy a cell in the fucking honeycomb. Well, that's a very profitable business,
but it always fails. It always fails on the consumer side. Whereas as Jeffrey Epstein and
Jez Staley are telling you right now, right there in fucking print, it works on their side.
They've got all the archetypes they'll ever need. They're selling archetypes as much as,
um, you know, it's, it's important, I think, not to forget that Jeffrey Epstein, as well as being,
you know, a monstrous child sex trafficker, was also on the Council of Foreign Relations.
You know, he was also tight with Bill Clinton all through his presidency. This is a guy of enormous
fucking influence. This is a guy who was appointed to the board of Rockefeller University without a
college degree and knows fucking nothing about science, and yet for some reason, uh, was on the
board of directors of maybe the most prestigious, you know, post-secondary science school in New York
City. What the fuck is that? And, and it is not just, you know, the rape of children that this man is
selling. It's not even just the blackmail aspect of that rape that he's selling. It is the chance
for people on the other side of the archetypal divide, the chance for the people who build the
fucking honeycombs that all of us are scrambling for the last spot in before this whole shit show goes
up. It is the chance for those people to get to see firsthand exactly how much power they actually
have. And because of course they have no interest in knowing these girls, these victims, of course,
you know, the, the act of knowing them would invalidate the entire premise. It would be disgusting to these
people. So they don't bother sorting them into human beings whose names they know. Fuck that. I don't
want to have to think about that. They work from the other side of whatever mass cultural archetype,
uh, they have in many cases helped produce in the first place and which these, these wounded,
vulnerable, helpless people have one way or another found themselves inside. And this goes,
this goes of course for the entire relationship of capital to labor, capital to society everywhere on
earth. But it, it, it works to be an especially painful and, and fucking nauseating way to see these
people talking about it very, very directly that however these girls got where they are, uh, they are
now essentially piled up in fucking broom closets until someone like Jez Staley needs another Snow White.
And then they pull another girl out, use her for what they want and she disappears. And I had been,
I had been kind of reticent to talk about this because, um, when, when the Epstein stuff was still
new, I didn't want to, first of all, I just wanted to wait to see what we found out. And second,
I didn't want to prejudice anyone else's ideas of what they were seeing. Um, but now that it's,
you know, three ish years later and, uh, fucking nothing appears to be happening. I think I can say
I have, I have felt since the first time I saw the temple on Epstein's Island that I knew exactly what
that was. I knew what it was for the moment I saw it. And look, I may be in a factually sense wrong.
Who the fuck knows? Who, who, who would ever admit knowing if I was wrong? Um, but in, in the general
sense, in, in the sense, uh, whereby these girls were made into instrumentation for these people,
they were made into raw fucking architectural material. I think it stands. And what I have
always seen in that temple is that on top, there is a statue of the God variously known as Poseidon
or Neptune. And as many of you probably know, that was the, uh, Greco Roman God of the sea. And this,
uh, this temple is placed very dramatically, uh, atop, atop, atop a bunch of sea cliffs.
And if you know your, uh, Greco Roman mythology, you will know that there is a history, uh, in fact,
quite, quite an extensive one with goddesses and goddess like figures coming out of the sea.
And one of these occurred when, uh, Zeus or Jupiter, uh, castrated his father, uh, Saturn or
Kronos. And the genitals of Kronos fell into the ocean and caused this sort of massive frothing
whirlpool. And out of that whirlpool climbed Aphrodite, the, you know, the, I guess, probably
if we were in ancient Greece here, it would be Haphrodite, but you all, you all know the word
Aphrodite, the, the ideal of feminine beauty. And she very notably, um, got out of the water and
climbed up some sea cliffs. She was among the ancient Greeks and Romans known, uh, among other
epithets as the Scythireon because, uh, the island variously called Kutera or Scythira or Scythirea.
Um, that was the island where she supposedly climbed up the shore and onto land. And to have that temple
right there at the other end of the island from all of those fucking bizarre, frightening bungalows with
blacked out windows and shit. Um, the moment I saw that temple for the first time, I thought, you know,
think is not even the word I just felt, um, this is where he's transforming them.
Um, this is where in Epstein's mind, at least, and maybe in the minds of his clientele,
this is where he takes these kidnapped fucking girls, uh, to undergo whether purely psychologically
or who knows what else, uh, some version of the Aphrodite and, uh, transformation.
And, uh, wish and, and, and mythos that he is taking what we're just, you know, in so many cases,
we're just, uh, regular ass teenage girls from all over America, all over the world. And in this
moment by feeding them through this temple, he, in his mind, because remember it's the rich and the
powerful who get to tell you what archetypes you're allowed to follow, right? Well, he has slammed
down the archetype of, of the, the whole Zeus, Kronos, uh, Aphrodite transformational narrative.
And whoever you were, when you went into that temple, you're not that person anymore after you
come out of it. Not to Jeffrey Epstein, not to the kinds of people, uh, that are spending the money
to be there or are legally and politically friendly enough to him to be there. And that notion has been
horrifying me, um, on a nearly daily basis for over three years now, because it's pretty fucking hard
to stop thinking about once you've started thinking about it. And then to see these fucking emails,
what character would you like next? Beauty and the beast, beauty and the beast. And if, if only there
were a song mentions all of this, that I don't know, maybe was recorded in Germany because that's
where all the, the, the basic insights about the modern foundations of the culture industry come from
and how consumption has replaced political activity. And it would be, be great also if, you know,
speaking of Pinchon, uh, it was a record that was obsessed with the, you know, the, the falsehood
of the ostensible post cold war international order, and maybe even had some V2 rockets on it somewhere.
But I mean, I don't know, you guys can tell me, I don't know of any songs like that.
I mean, I don't know.
You can't say no to the beauty and the beast.
Something in the night, something in the day, nothing is wrong with darkness, something's in the way.
There's a slaughter in the air, protest on the wind.
Someone else decide it, someone cook at skin.
My, my.
Someone fetch a priest.
