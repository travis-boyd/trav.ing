This is not the normal!
This is damn bad!
This is not the normal!
This is not the old Bowie stuff I talked about years and years ago, the Black Star series in particular, and reminded me how much more I wanted to say about David Bowie and how much deeper I wanted to get into a fair amount of his work.
And one of the big points I have been building toward in thinking about all that is doing an episode about Diamond Dogs from 1974, which is one of my favorite Bowie albums.
Maybe my favorite Bowie album and is often the album I will give to people when I say David Bowie and they're like, oh yeah, let's dance and fame and all that.
But this is the one I will show to people to demonstrate what kind of artist he actually was.
And in thinking about ways to approach Diamond Dogs as a totality, because I'll let you in on a little secret here.
I don't know if other people are like this, but I, in anything I'm doing really, in actual art or broadcasting or whatever you would call this,
I'm often afraid to do shows on the things I care about most, to do shows on the things I think I have the most to say about,
because I know inevitably, as soon as I'm done, I will think, I fucked that up.
I did a terrible fucking job. I didn't get this or this or this or this, which is part of why it's taken me so long to do this.
So inevitably, I will miss important things and probably have to circle back to certain things, but I hope it'll work out all right.
And so in terms of a kind of general heuristic for looking at Diamond Dogs, I think there are a couple good ideas to keep in mind.
And one of them is that David Bowie's work often veers between or sometimes kind of synthesizes two extremes.
And there are what I would call his apocalyptic albums and what I would call his nightmare labyrinth purgatorial albums.
And on the apocalyptic albums, they're all about some kind of grand push toward and past a limit or horizon or frontier.
And they usually culminate in some kind of, you know, quasi-orgasmic death transcendence of that sort of frontier.
And obviously the foremost example there would be Ziggy Stardust, although as I think I said on an episode about Ziggy Stardust a long time ago, it's more complicated than that.
It's more subtle than that.
But that's one kind of album he makes.
And then the other kind of album he makes is about the realization that there is no frontier.
There is no horizon.
There is no linear push toward, you know, transcendence of some kind of limit.
And that what we are going to get for the rest of history is the worst that history has to offer,
reprising itself in new and worse ways every single time.
And for one of those albums, I would offer The Next Day, which I think I have said on previous episodes here is not one of my favorite albums of his.
But actually, I have come to think recently that it's a complete masterpiece and that I just didn't really understand it.
So you have these two kind of opposing sides, the one about, you know, the insane push toward the limit and the other about realizing it's cyclical.
There is no limit.
And part of the reason his later work, you know, Heathen Reality, The Next Day, Blackstar is so effective is that you can hear him realizing, you know, on a song like Heathen or Sunday or Slow Burn.
And then all of The Next Day and Blackstar basically hear this guy who I'm just going to take a wild guess and say didn't expect to live that long.
You know, thought he would probably burn out in some glorious act of, you know, both hedonism and self-sacrifice when he was pretty young.
Seeing this guy realize that, oh, no, there's not going to be some gigantic breakdown.
There's not going to be a cataclysmic event past which either I don't live or nothing lives.
What's going to happen is that I am going to break down very slowly and very painfully.
And everything I presumed to be culture or society or civilization is going to break down alongside me day by day, even hour by hour.
And it's going to be incredibly painful.
And every day is going to be more painful than the day before it.
And there is absolutely nothing I can do about it.
But that is sort of a status reserved, I would say, for his last four albums, his albums of the 21st century.
In the 20th, I think they largely fall into one of those two camps, either the sort of, you know, apocalyptic transcendent thing or the locked in hell cyclical nightmare thing.
And you can see that, I mean, not just in his work, but in the mood of the time very much, right?
Because there were, you know, I hate talking about the 60s.
I hate the entire notion of the 60s.
But if you go back to sort of prevailing cultural trends back then, there were, of course, on one hand, the relatively more serious people, people with a real grounding in political economy or whatever,
who hoped that it would present some kind of historical aperture for a new kind of Marxism, let's say, just as an example.
And on the other extreme, there were people who I don't think were really ever beguiled into thinking, oh, yeah, this is a worldwide revolution.
Everything forever will be different after this.
But who just sort of generally hoped, you know, maybe with the social gains of the 1960s, that maybe the rest of time wouldn't be as bad.
But there was definitely a kind of middle constituency that I was going to say thought.
I don't know if thought is the word.
Insofar as thought at all, its plan for like what the 60s meant was, OK, guys, here's what we're going to do.
We're all going to get together on New Year's Eve 1969.
And then at midnight on January 1st, 1970, we're all going to come so hard that we die and go to heaven.
Like that was the idea that that there was something revolutionary about self-indulgence and that, in fact, you could indulge yourself into a, you know, hagiographical status.
You could do so many drugs that you just automatically became a saint.
You could fuck so much that you became, you know, a religious archon, which I would hope my audience would know is not true.
That does not work.
And so you can see how these things are played out in especially the early Bowie albums, since we're talking about Diamond Dogs here, and how his records kind of veer back and forth between these extremes.
It's not that, you know, every record is always just one extreme, because Bowie is very rarely working on just one level.
You know, he was, I would argue, of all the songwriters and, you know, recent pop music history, probably the best at saying things completely sincerely and also at a deep, ironic remove at the same time and meaning both of them.
And so for, you know, the man who sold the world, which is in many ways his first real album, you have a song like The Superman, which is about, you know, immortal creatures who want nothing more than to be able to die.
Because without death, their immortality is meaningless.
Every day is the same as every other day.
There is no reason to do anything or not to do anything.
It's just this flat, blank, fucking desert of infinity out in front of them.
And then you have Hunky Dory.
And Hunky Dory is not one of the most, like, thematically unified Bowie albums.
Although I think it is more so than I would have thought a couple years ago, let's say.
And insofar as there is a form, not a form, pardon me, a thematic through line.
I think the thematic through line of Hunky Dory is about the idea that this generation, i.e. Bowie's, or if not that generation, then the next one.
Because this is, you know, the album about, with a song about him having his first child.
That either this generation or the next generation is going to be something not exactly the same as human beings.
Not what human beings have been, you know, since the development of Homo sapiens up to about World War II.
Because these human beings, such as they are, have been raised in an environment so saturated with media.
So completely, you know, stuffed to the brim with representations of everything else in the world.
That they don't have a comparable experience of what being alive means.
You know, if you put them next to someone who lived through the 20s and 30s.
It's not just that they're seeing things that weren't seen before, hearing things that weren't heard before.
No, it's that the saturation of media is so intense that these people have effectively become sort of the host bodies for the parasitic proliferation of media.
You know, I talked about that in one of the Black Star shows.
About the idea that we, insofar as, you know, human perception is concerned.
You could argue that we already live in a world in which everything has happened and there's nothing else.
Because it's all been on screen.
It's all been, you know, it's all been on a record.
It's all been filmed.
Every, more than we could possibly do or see in our lifetimes has already been fed to us in the form of media.
And of course, that does two things.
Two dangerous and not quite diametrically opposed, but I would say dichotomous things.
Number one, it convinces us that we've, you know, seen the world.
That we know the world.
That we understand how things are way beyond the ken of our personal experience.
And on the other hand, it makes sure that the objects of those understanding, or the objects of that understanding, pardon me,
are the same for basically everyone in a given time and place.
And are stereotypical and facile to the point where, you know, I have a big grudge against most so-called documentary filmmaking.
I fucking hate watching the average documentary because all I see is what the documentarian is doing, not what's actually on screen.
And it's in exactly that sense that, you know, if you are presented with something as supposedly neutral documentary evidence that is in fact, you know, profoundly slanted,
that is coming in very much with its own sort of negative or positive charge, its own sort of angle and polarity,
you will think you understand the world via a series primarily of images and sound recordings that are in fact constructed to give you very specific ideas about what the world is.
And at that point, once it's not simply a matter of technical possibility for that kind of thing, right?
But it's a matter of unavoidability, that no matter who you are in the Western world,
you have been soaked in this shit for your entire lifetime.
You could make the argument, and I think this is the idea of Hunky Dory, that that's not really Homo sapiens anymore.
That is something else.
That is Homo Mediatus or whatever the fuck the Latin would be.
And that's very much the idea behind a song like Life on Mars,
a song like the Bewley Brothers,
a song, maybe most obviously, the song Andy Warhol.
The whole point of the song Andy Warhol and the whole point of the guy Andy Warhol
is that there is no difference between Andy Warhol,
the alleged person who allegedly breathes and eats and shits,
although frankly I'm not sure about any of that with him,
but there is no difference between the flesh and the representation.
Andy Warhol's life mission was to make himself into a photo of Andy Warhol.
That to me is why that song is there on that record,
because it's about, in a way, the great predecessor of this new generation of people
who it's not only that they've been exposed to a lot of media,
it's that their entire idea of world and self and social relation,
their entire idea of everything is predicated on all these parasitic media life forms
that now live within them.
They cannot talk or think or feel outside of that,
because it's not just that they have been told what to talk about
or how to think or how to feel by all that media,
it's that they have been told what talking about anything means.
They have been told what feeling is.
They have been told what thinking is.
It's not just the subject matter.
It's the structure.
It's the mechanism.
So I think Hunky Dory in that sense is,
it's sort of given a campy gloss sometimes in a song like Oh You Pretty Things,
but I think it's really a grim fucking despairing album.
And then, of course, you get to Ziggy Stardust,
which both is and isn't the exact opposite,
because on the one hand, it is a pretty straight-up retelling
of a kind of Orphic musician messiah figure
who is then, as all Orphic figures must be,
torn to pieces and devoured by his own followers.
On the other hand, a lot of that album is kind of a parody
of either what people think rock stars' lives are like
or the actuality of the kind of grubbiness of a rock star's life.
You know, in Suffragette City, when he says,
my school day's insane, my work's down the drain,
what is he, like fucking 17?
You know, I think that's clearly a song about, like,
a teenager imagining a rock star.
Because in his mind, you know, he's only got that one frame of reference.
So rock star to him is like, ooh, I would hardly have any time to do homework.
You know, and so that is a limit album.
That's a, you know, transcendence album.
But it also isn't.
And then Aladdin Sane, which I may treat at more length at some point,
Aladdin Sane, I think, cuts all the way back the other way.
That, you know, for all the irony and sarcasm of an album like Ziggy Stardust,
and this is a recurring thing with Bowie,
you know, Rock and Roll Suicide is sort of an intentionally absurd song.
It's kind of supposed to be over the top, you know?
And the idea of, you know, this rock star being dismembered
and presumably eaten by his fans,
it's a parody of the idea of, you know,
what ritual has come to in Western civilization.
But it's also not a parody at all.
It is sincere in the sense that just the act of someone,
anyone at all really,
but especially someone who looked and sounded and talked like David Bowie
at that time in 72, 73,
reaching out to all these kids in the audience and saying,
give me your hands because you're wonderful.
You know, however deeply echelon the ironies are,
being the person to say,
I don't care who you are,
I don't care what other people say about you,
I don't care how much you hate yourself
or how little you feel you fit in,
how deeply estranged from everyone else you are,
you are wonderful,
I love you,
give me your hands.
You know, no matter how sarcastic Bowie is being,
that also is true.
That also is sincere and real.
He's not faking his way through that.
You know,
these aren't sarcastic hysterics.
And in the same way,
even though the idea of,
you know,
a rock star occupying the place of,
on the one hand,
you know,
Jesus Christ,
and on the other hand,
someone like,
I don't know,
a fascist dictator,
which we're going to get to pretty soon,
that's sincere too.
that album,
among other things,
is Bowie's first great dawning recognition,
that the machinations of,
you know,
what I have called the iconic sphere,
the sphere of imaginary reality,
and notice,
I do mean imaginary reality,
it's not imaginary,
in the sense of being fake,
it is the part of the reality,
that exists,
in our imaginations,
that iconic sphere,
is filled,
with these figures,
whether we know it or not,
whether we have any idea,
of the genealogy of them,
this shit goes back,
thousands and thousands,
and thousands of years,
and I don't like the word archetypes,
because that makes it seem,
as though every one of them,
must fit a particular role,
in a particular way,
it's not nearly that cut and dried,
as with most things,
about psychoanalysis,
and particularly Carl Jung,
but the idea,
that in the iconosphere,
in the world of,
you know,
cultural and social iconography,
that a rock star,
in the early 70s,
could occupy both,
potentially the place of,
you know,
the Orphic mystery cults,
which,
some archaeologists,
seem to think,
were the,
very oldest,
of the Greek religions,
and,
you can't call them,
monotheism precisely,
but,
one of the first,
sort of turns,
toward monotheism,
in exalting,
this particular figure,
over all others,
despite the fact that,
you know,
some element,
of a pantheon,
does remain,
it could be,
that kind of figure,
and it could also be,
Mussolini,
and,
they,
they hold,
a similar,
sort of,
they,
they take up,
the same amount of space,
you know,
they're,
they're roughly,
as,
as,
dense,
and long,
and wide,
as each other,
and,
then of course,
there's the,
immediate slap in the face,
right after Ziggy Stardust,
of Aladdin Sane,
which is,
essentially,
it's Orpheus in Hell,
and,
what Orpheus in Hell,
meant to David Bowie,
was Ziggy in America,
and,
Aladdin Sane,
is the album,
where both he,
David Bowie,
and the Ziggy character,
he wasn't calling himself that,
by that point,
I don't think,
but,
it's essentially,
the Ziggy character,
where they go over to America,
and see how things like,
the record business,
and Hollywood,
and all the social scenes,
both,
uh,
predicated upon,
the record business,
and upon which,
the record business,
is predicated,
uh,
how all that shit,
actually works,
how absolutely,
grimy,
and backbiting,
and just,
catatonically depressing,
it is,
to watch these people,
do what they do,
you know,
the first fucking song,
on the album,
watch that man,
he looks like a jerk,
but he could eat you,
with a fork and spoon,
going over here,
and seeing all these fucking,
you know,
middle aged men,
in,
in gaudy suits,
they bought,
to try to be cool,
and on the one hand,
sitting in the corner,
going like,
look at that fucking loser,
and on the other,
knowing,
oh,
he could just crush,
any one of us,
at any time,
and I see Aladdin Sane,
being very much,
the,
the Orpheus in Hell album,
in which he realizes,
uh,
the nature of all the infrastructure,
that allowed for the sort of,
you know,
elevated,
attempted transcendence,
of the whole Ziggy thing,
you know,
this,
this is a,
this is a,
no limit album,
this is a,
a purgatorial labyrinth album,
where,
you become aware,
song by song,
oh yeah,
all that other,
high flown shit,
was premised on,
the sleaziest people on earth,
fucking each other over,
as much as they can,
and when you get to a song,
like,
cracked actor,
which by the way,
I will contend,
has the two,
nastiest guitar sounds,
in recorded music,
there's the,
the rhythm guitar sound,
that opens the song,
and then just a few seconds in,
there is a lead guitar,
um,
which,
uh,
Mick Ronson,
the guitarist,
and the spiders from Mars,
uh,
played in recorded,
using,
uh,
one of his favorite tricks,
which is where you take,
a wah-wah pedal,
and,
a wah-wah,
I'm sure everybody,
here has heard,
or seen,
somebody use one of those,
but what a wah-wah pedal,
does basically,
is put a spike,
in the frequency output,
of your guitar,
and then it moves,
that spike,
forward and back,
and so,
as you move it,
you get this,
wow,
wow,
wow,
sound,
well if you just put it,
in the middle,
it doesn't go,
wow,
it just sticks,
in the most nasal part,
of that,
that,
that EQ curve,
the filter,
hangs right in the middle,
and just goes,
aww,
and that,
aww,
sound,
is,
um,
one of Mick Ronson's,
favorite tricks,
almost makes the guitar,
sound like it,
like an exploding harmonica,
or something,
um,
those two guitar sounds,
are so fucking good,
but anyway,
I mean,
the hook of that song,
Crack Baby Crack,
show me your reel,
Smack Baby Smack,
is all that you feel,
suck baby suck,
give me your head,
before you start professing,
that you're knocking me dead,
like,
god damn,
that,
that's some real,
streets of LA,
type shit,
and so from there,
we get finally,
to Diamond Dogs,
and,
as some of you will probably know,
uh,
Diamond Dogs,
originally began,
as an attempt,
to make a musical,
out of 1984,
and,
uh,
I believe it was,
Orwell's widow,
eventually stepped in,
and refused,
uh,
permission,
for them to use,
that material,
and thank god,
she did,
because,
a musical,
based on 1984,
probably would have sucked,
balls,
and she,
accidentally,
forced Bowie,
to make something,
much,
much better,
and much,
much,
grimmer,
than 1984,
because 1984,
is the most,
you know,
fucking,
seventh grade,
comic book version,
of,
an authoritarian regime,
you can possibly imagine,
and,
and the implication,
all the time,
is that this regime,
has been,
entirely forced,
on its populace,
by some,
kind of,
unspoken,
I don't know,
revolutionary power,
or coup d'etat,
whatever,
well,
Bowie went,
in exactly,
the opposite direction,
he did use,
some songs,
that were,
originally going to be,
in the 1984 thing,
like the song,
1984,
uh,
a great one,
called Dodo,
that didn't make the album,
that I'll tell you about later,
um,
uh,
uh,
We Are the Dead,
one of the best songs,
on the album,
but it's not about 1984,
and it's good that it isn't,
because,
after the,
kind of,
the honky dory,
Ziggy,
Aladdin,
saying triumvirate,
I think,
um,
Diamond Dogs,
is the album,
in terms of its,
you don't want to say,
politics exactly,
because it's not like,
it's coming out,
and making,
you know,
pronouncements,
about the labor theory,
of value,
or some shit,
but in terms of,
its political imagination,
in terms of,
the way,
it imagined things,
it imagines things,
winding up,
um,
was most accurate,
and also,
most brutal,
of everything,
Bowie ever did,
and,
I think it's important,
before,
starting the album,
as such,
to know,
that,
this was in a period,
when,
um,
the resurgence,
of fascism,
especially,
in England,
but also,
in certain chunks,
of Western Europe,
was very much,
on people's minds,
it was,
um,
right around 1970,
I believe,
that,
um,
a,
a traditionally,
very poor,
part of London,
called,
the Isle of Dogs,
elected,
a,
minister of parliament,
named Derek Beacon,
who was just,
an out and out,
neo-Nazi,
like,
basically,
no apology,
at all,
uh,
I think they were still,
called the National Front,
at that point,
and,
this was also,
a time,
in which,
um,
enough years,
had passed,
since World War II,
that there,
there were,
neo-fascist groups,
in Italy,
um,
openly,
neo-fascist groups,
you know,
not hidden ones,
who would,
um,
do,
you know,
marches and demonstrations,
on May Day,
and shit,
walking down the street,
in black shirts,
with,
you know,
red armbands,
and giving the Heil Hitler salute,
and,
you know,
it was getting,
getting too close,
to some of those people,
that probably,
ended up,
uh,
causing the murder,
of Pier Paolo Pasolini,
who,
was,
famously,
uh,
killed,
in bizarre circumstances,
and probably,
by Italian,
neo-fascists,
and,
of course,
I mean,
anyone who listens,
to this show,
knows,
all the Gladio shit,
all the CIA,
and NATO sponsored,
fascist,
and Nazi cells,
uh,
present throughout Europe,
at the time,
it's kind of hard,
to believe,
Bowie would have known,
very much about that,
but,
he certainly,
would have been aware,
that,
for the first time,
in,
you know,
25 years,
or so,
uh,
fascists,
were coming out,
and unapologetically,
describing,
themselves,
as fascists,
but,
what he did,
with that idea,
is,
I think,
the key point,
of the entire album,
one has been taught,
to imagine,
fascism,
right,
as this,
entirely,
top-down,
phenomenon,
that someone,
is going to get,
in power,
and then impose,
absolute,
autarky,
upon you,
and upon your society,
the entire,
commons,
will be crushed,
every normal,
person,
you know,
the vast,
bulk,
of the population,
will be suffering,
under the yoke,
of one madman,
that's,
how we've always,
been taught,
to think about it here,
partially,
because,
um,
if it weren't,
just one madman,
we might have to explain,
why we,
uh,
have so many Nazis,
working in the CIA,
and the Department of Defense,
and,
out there at Edgewood Arsenal,
testing mysterious things,
in little laboratories,
and also,
why we,
uh,
why we spent millions,
and millions of dollars,
on Licio Gelli,
the,
the head of the SS,
in Italy,
who then,
uh,
helped take over,
the Propaganda Due Lodge,
which then became,
the central,
Italian rallying point,
for,
uh,
neo-fascist,
gladio activities,
so on,
so forth,
you get the idea,
we have to believe,
for our own,
historical mythology,
that,
fascism,
or,
dictatorship,
or,
authoritarianism,
whatever you want to call it,
is,
is always a matter of,
of a nation,
sort of,
losing its mind,
and electing one man,
who then does everything wrong,
and that is exactly,
what Diamond Dogs,
is not about,
that is exactly,
what it is a refusal of,
um,
after the push-pull,
push-pull,
in Bowie's work,
between,
you know,
the idea of some sort of,
orgasmic apocalypse,
on the one hand,
and the idea of things,
being,
uh,
horribly repetitious,
you know,
the same thing,
but worse,
shout out Felix,
uh,
every day,
for the rest of history,
he comes to a,
fascinating,
sort of synthesis,
of those ideas,
in Diamond Dogs,
and the sense of,
synthesis,
is basically this,
if,
you give people,
enough,
uh,
personal freedom,
in the cheapest sense of freedom,
if you give people,
the license,
to basically,
do what they want to do,
in their own lives,
and fuck,
whom they want to fuck,
and however much,
they want to fuck,
and do drugs,
and party,
if you basically don't,
interfere,
with people's self-indulgence,
you can then,
take away,
the entire armature,
of what used to be considered,
the state,
and in this case,
um,
this was a very much,
of the moment example,
because,
this is when,
uh,
as I,
recently talked about,
in another show,
that I think is going to,
dovetail real well,
with this one,
this is the,
beginning of,
uh,
the decline of,
of the British welfare state,
in particular,
and we can say a lot,
about,
you know,
the end of the New Deal,
as well,
and,
uh,
Nixon,
and Watergate,
and Jimmy Carter,
and the invention of neoliberalism,
and that,
that would all be true,
but particularly,
in a British context,
you know,
this is a country,
that since,
the,
well,
I was going to say,
since the end of World War II,
but really,
um,
since partway through World War II,
because the war itself,
necessitated this kind of politics,
uh,
they had been working,
at least,
on some level,
as a social democratic welfare state,
I'm sorry,
I,
I have to take a drink,
my fucking dry mouth sounds,
are probably incredibly annoying,
just a moment,
delicioso,
um,
the,
the post-war,
socialist welfare state,
of Great Britain,
had,
you know,
obviously,
with some interruptions,
uh,
more or less,
persisted for 25 odd years,
and,
of course,
it wasn't,
you know,
full socialism,
or anything like that,
but,
the,
the features of that welfare state,
in terms of things like,
the National Health Service,
and,
you know,
unemployment,
uh,
unemployment benefits,
and pensions,
everything like that,
is just,
beyond the wildest dreams,
of even the most optimistic,
you know,
American,
sort of,
Bernie crat supporter,
you,
you wouldn't fucking believe,
how well it used to work there,
and,
then into the 70s,
you get the whole,
uh,
tendency of the rate of profit,
to fall thing,
and,
a British political coalition,
in,
no small part,
led by Margaret Thatcher,
who then goes on to become,
arguably,
the worst prime minister,
in the history of England,
uh,
they just tear down,
that entire idea,
they reacquaint,
the entire British public,
with a very American notion,
that,
if you have rights,
it's because you can pay for them,
and if you can't pay for them,
they're not really rights,
as,
as,
Maggie herself said,
there is no such thing,
as society,
I,
I will always remember,
a quote of hers,
in which she was professing,
professing to be a Christian,
and,
um,
someone asked her,
how can,
you be a follower,
of a man,
who said that the rich,
cannot get into heaven,
and that,
you had to give away,
all your possessions,
to the poor,
and Margaret Thatcher,
responded,
and I'm paraphrasing here,
but I'm not,
departing,
you know,
from the original tenor,
she said,
well,
I value,
I value,
I value,
individual free choice,
above anything else,
I value,
the individual's decision,
to do what he thinks is right,
within the marketplace,
and for Jesus,
that meant deciding to be crucified,
and so,
and so,
I admire Jesus,
as the ultimate,
free market rational actor,
because,
because,
even if it didn't make sense,
at the time,
he made the right choice,
Jesus Christ,
what the fuck was wrong,
with that bitch,
so,
anyway,
you have,
the,
the,
not just beginnings,
but by this point,
pretty,
pretty well on,
um,
disintegration,
of the social welfare state,
really in a,
lot of countries,
but,
especially in Britain,
and what Diamond Dogs,
as an album,
is about,
is that,
if you simply let,
those things decay,
but you allow,
as much personal,
licentiousness,
personal indulgence,
personal decadence,
as anybody could ask for,
these same people,
the people who are now,
freaks,
and hippies,
and hipsters,
and,
you know,
druggies,
and pervs,
whatever,
those same people,
will come back to you,
begging for fascism,
because given enough time,
given enough aimlessness,
given enough,
you know,
self-indulgence,
that ends up being,
uh,
neutral,
if not painful,
those people will be so desperate,
for some sense of meaning,
some kind of fucking horizon,
to define their lives against,
the whole,
you know,
Martin Heidegger,
being towards death thing,
that,
that you,
you define,
and evaluate,
uh,
the things you do in your life,
against the idea,
that one day,
you will eventually die,
and in the same way,
if you remove those horizons,
from people,
and you have them stuck,
in,
in this sort of,
uh,
you know,
gyroscopic environment,
of,
the same little cycles,
and circles,
over and over again,
even if they enjoy that,
for a while,
what they will then eventually do,
is crawl back to you,
and beg,
to be told,
what you do,
and,
that to me,
more than anything else,
is what Diamond Dogs,
is about,
and,
um,
that to me,
also was Bowie,
calling his shot,
really,
um,
for,
not,
not just what would become the 80s,
when he was completely fucking right,
Ronald Reagan,
Jesus,
um,
but,
um,
talking about the,
the,
the future of humanity in general,
you know,
that's why that first track,
is called,
future legend,
it's not saying,
this is a legend,
uh,
about the future,
he's saying,
in the future,
you will look back at this,
and understand that,
as the legend of your time,
and he was fucking right,
and,
of course,
the album proper begins with,
maybe the best line in his entire career,
in terms of just,
something I,
you know,
would paint on the side of buildings,
this ain't rock and roll,
this is genocide,
and then,
immediately,
immediately cut into,
the title track,
which is,
one of his best,
kind of,
the Rolling Stones,
but more so,
type songs,
and,
is about,
all of these,
sort of,
you know,
decadent people,
who like to fancy themselves,
artists,
but they're really just,
sort of,
hangers on,
and scenesters,
having some gigantic,
fucking party,
in the,
you know,
semi-vacant shell,
of a,
it's implicitly New York,
when he says,
you know,
Halloween Jack,
lives on top of a Manhattan chase,
the elevator's broke,
so he slides down a rope,
down to the street below,
hey Tarzy,
go man,
go,
you know,
the,
the first,
real,
sung lyric of the album,
is,
as they pulled you out of the oxygen tent,
you ask for the latest party,
that's the whole fucking thing,
right there,
that,
the,
the simple,
aimless,
uh,
satisfaction,
of one's own,
most immediate desires,
will propel,
those same people,
uh,
toward a desperation,
for direction,
a desperation,
for some sort of,
you know,
ethical or moral code,
no matter how factitious,
and plainly,
idiotic,
I mean,
Jesus fucking,
Christ,
look at Manhattan,
right now,
look at all the people,
in lower Manhattan,
pretending that they're like,
right wing,
orthodox Christians,
because they snorted,
too much fucking ketamine,
between 2018,
and 2021,
and it made them feel like,
maybe they were wasting,
their lives a little bit,
and so they jump immediately,
into fucking,
pseudo catholic,
public confessional,
struggle sessions,
where they call each other,
whores,
for all doing the same thing,
that all of them do,
I mean,
it's just,
that's Diamond Dogs,
right there,
that is fucking Diamond Dogs,
you know,
people whose,
names I can mention,
and,
and probably don't need to,
people who I,
I know the kind of,
jokes they were making,
and things they were saying,
you know,
five,
six years ago,
now fucking hanging out,
with Steve Bannon,
and wearing fucking,
lace men tias,
into the gift shop,
at some fucking cathedral,
fuck off,
fuck you,
you don't get to decide,
you're Catholic now,
asshole,
uh,
I mean,
that's,
that's what,
Diamond Dogs in general,
is about,
and it is,
it is about,
in that sense,
um,
how,
how should I put this,
Bowie was a big fan of Burroughs,
and,
and,
he knew Burroughs,
periodically,
I don't know if they were ever really friends,
but they certainly met and talked,
on and off,
and,
um,
the,
one of the key,
ideas,
one of the key textures,
going on,
in Diamond Dogs,
is the radical fakeness,
of the environment,
around you,
and about how,
when you were presented,
with that kind of radical fakeness,
you,
you have,
basically,
two choices,
and one of them,
is to try to tear it down,
and see what's really going on,
and the other,
is to try to,
you know,
adapt,
and manicure,
and redesign,
that fake world,
for your goals,
and,
and this may seem a little bit rambling,
um,
but I want to talk about,
an idea,
I've really had for years and years,
that partly comes from,
Diamond Dogs,
this is one of the first Bowie albums,
I ever heard,
I think I was probably,
15 or 16,
so I've,
I've spent a lot of time,
thinking about this,
and,
there,
there is an idea,
that in my sort of,
private language,
uh,
and I hope this,
this use of the term,
isn't offensive to anybody,
I'll explain what I mean,
in a minute,
um,
there's a concept,
that I call being,
on the reservation,
and,
um,
I feel,
I have,
I mean,
it's not a matter of,
earning the right to say something,
like I can,
you know,
suffer in a specific way enough,
that doesn't really make any sense,
but,
I think,
probably every American,
should have to go,
to at least a couple,
Native American tribal reservations,
because,
they are some of the,
grimmest fucking places,
in the world,
you take everything,
that was ever valuable,
to these people,
you extract,
every conceivable resource,
from what used to be their land,
and then you sit them down,
in the shittiest,
most arid,
fucking ten square miles,
of,
you know,
the desert,
in one of the four corner states,
and say,
aren't you glad to have a home,
and as,
as someone pointed out,
in,
in the comments to my last show,
uh,
we think of,
you know,
crack in the 80's,
for example,
or meth,
in the 90's,
and now,
and we think of,
inner cities,
or,
or poorer places,
but,
um,
a ton of that shit,
on,
on Native American reservations,
getting in by various,
mysterious means,
who knows why,
you know,
they suddenly went from,
weed and whiskey,
a few decades ago,
to being flooded with crack,
and fucking crank,
and various kinds of opioids,
you know,
who knows,
why there's so many people,
dying of fentanyl overdoses,
in those places,
I guess it's just,
one of those mysteries,
so when I say reservation,
I,
I,
at least have some,
um,
empirical experience,
to know what I'm talking about,
uh,
but when I think of this term,
on the reservation,
I think of it,
in exactly the opposite sense,
and,
I remember,
with crystal clarity,
the moment,
I had this idea,
because I was covering,
uh,
Lollapalooza,
2008,
in Grant Park,
in Chicago,
uh,
and,
I,
I was standing near,
the front gate,
of,
of,
uh,
the,
you know,
entrance to the whole festival,
and,
the vast majority,
of the people there,
were like,
probably,
30 or younger,
and white,
and,
there are all these,
Chicago cops,
just standing there,
watching the crowd,
and,
people in this crowd,
are really,
really,
openly,
doing illegal shit,
in front of cops,
I saw more fucking,
one hitters,
and,
even what,
what looked like,
uh,
pipes for smoking,
more serious things,
passed around,
among that crowd,
in wild ass,
full view of the police,
and the cops,
just stared,
and,
I thought for a minute,
like,
do they just,
they don't care,
or what,
what's going on here,
and then realized,
oh no,
no,
no,
we're on the other kind,
of reservation,
right now,
Native American people,
get forced to be,
on a reservation,
where they don't get,
to be Americans,
not really,
we,
on the other hand,
pay,
to be on this reservation,
our job,
is,
to,
demonstrate,
that we have the money,
that we,
we have cash enough,
to be let into,
one of these places,
and then for,
you know,
$500,
or whatever,
a weekend pass,
costs,
we get to act out,
the moron fantasy,
of what living,
in a free country,
would be like,
we,
we pay just enough,
to pretend we're free,
for two and a half days,
and of course,
what freedom,
actually means,
in these scenarios,
is,
you can,
commit,
a lot of crimes,
including crimes,
much more serious,
than,
you know,
smoking weed,
or whatever,
generally a lot of assaults,
at big festival type shit,
and,
you can pay $15,
for a bottle of water,
and you can eat,
some of the shittiest food,
you've ever found,
and you can take,
a one hitter,
from a stranger,
in you know,
2 14 in the afternoon,
because the fucking,
black keys are on stage,
and you would rather,
do anything other,
than listen to the black keys,
sober,
that's what you're paying for,
and if,
you know,
someone had passed me,
that one hitter,
50 feet to the left,
just outside,
the police cordon,
those cops,
this is the Chicago PD,
we're talking about,
I would have gotten,
fucking tackled,
at least,
and if I had been,
black,
if I had been,
Arabic,
I might have had my,
fucking head stomped in,
over that,
but because,
we had provided,
our credentials,
for you know,
freedom fantasy camp,
where you get to go,
act like,
you live in a real country,
for a weekend,
we were fine,
and I have,
I have never forgotten,
that sensation,
and that is a theme,
that runs deeply,
throughout,
William Burroughs,
and throughout,
Diamond Dogs,
and,
you know,
the,
the,
sort of,
sickly,
overindulgence,
of decadence,
leading you to,
realize,
you don't live,
in a real world,
not really,
and you can,
either try to,
get to a real world,
or you can try to,
tailor the fake one,
to your specifications,
and,
in that sense,
I think you could argue,
that,
if you consider it all,
one song,
the Diamond Dogs medley,
of,
sweet thing,
candidate,
sweet thing,
might be,
the best,
David Bowie song,
because,
it begins off,
begins off,
starts off,
as,
as ostensibly,
this sort of,
Broadway-ish song,
about what sounds like,
a young,
what would the word be,
sugar baby,
I guess,
a,
a young,
gay man,
who,
you know,
is,
is,
acting in the capacity,
of some kind of,
at least public partner,
for someone,
who's,
you know,
paying him off,
for that role,
you know,
I'm glad that you're,
older than me,
it makes me feel,
important and free,
you know,
that kind of shit,
but it soon,
becomes clear,
that we are listening,
to people,
who know,
that they are living,
in a fake environment,
and who have realized,
just like Bowie,
has realized,
that in this world,
of the iconosphere,
in this world,
of creating,
the emblems,
of the public imagination,
a rock star,
a politician,
you know,
any kind of celebrity,
any sort of person,
who plays,
a particular,
stereotyped role,
within that,
you know,
atmospheric layer,
whether it's,
you know,
the,
the,
the twinkie,
young male prostitute,
or,
you know,
the fucking old lady,
at the butcher shop,
or whatever,
they are all essentially,
performing the same role,
they are all,
at root,
engaged,
in the same sort of,
technology,
of,
or techniques,
I should say,
of the glomerating power,
to themselves,
as elements,
of the imaginary,
you know,
Bowie got in,
in trouble,
at one point,
for talking about,
Adolf Hitler,
as a rock star,
but he was absolutely right,
and he didn't mean it,
as a fucking compliment,
his point was that,
these sort of,
enormous efforts,
of alternate reality,
creation,
that Hitler,
and the Nazi party,
went to,
to turn this man,
from,
you know,
an asshole,
who was yelling,
drunk in a bar,
during the,
beer keller pooch,
to this,
almost super human,
you know,
a figure,
who I think,
totally apart,
from the question,
of how Hitler's death went,
I think there are people,
who think he didn't die there,
in the bunker,
simply because,
it doesn't seem like,
Hitler could die,
of any sort of,
normal human cause,
and I get that,
I know what they mean,
this is,
in a world of,
radical artificiality,
everyone is doing,
the same thing,
as that,
everyone is trying,
to agglomerate,
sort of,
elements of the,
social imagination,
unto themselves,
so that,
A,
they can become,
the locus,
of the,
you know,
psychological energy,
of everyone else,
around them,
and B,
so that they can then,
merchandise out,
their own existence,
as a,
a kind of,
a,
Eucharistic ceremony,
to the people,
who follow them,
that they can,
turn themselves,
into an identity badge,
and then sell it,
to their fans,
and,
I don't normally,
repeat,
you know,
big chunks of song lyrics,
on here,
but I think it's,
worth,
repeating all the words,
from Candidate,
because,
you know,
again,
the first part of the song,
Sweet Thing,
sounds like it's about,
some sort of,
you know,
flirty,
elegant,
young male prostitute,
and then it becomes,
very clear in Candidate,
that he recognizes,
that what he is doing,
is the same sort of,
machination,
that would be involved,
in anything,
from a television production,
to a political campaign,
so I,
I think I know,
all the words to Candidate,
so let me see,
if I can get these all out,
it's,
this is him,
talking to his,
prospective client,
ostensibly,
I'll make you a deal,
like any other candidate,
will pretend,
you're walking home,
because your future's at stake,
my set is amazing,
it even smells like a street,
there's a bar at the end,
where we can meet you,
and your friends,
someone scrawled on the wall,
I smell the blood,
of les tricoteurs,
who wrote up scandals,
in other bars,
we're having so much fun,
with the poisonous people,
spreading rumors,
and lies,
and stories they made up,
some make you sing,
and some make you scream,
and one makes you wish,
that you'd never been seen,
but there's a shop on the corner,
selling papier-mâché,
making bulletproof faces,
Charlie Manson,
Cassius Clay,
so if you want it,
boys,
get it here thing,
so you scream out of line,
I want you,
I need you,
anyone out there,
anytime,
a très butch little number,
went,
hey dirty,
I want you,
when it's good,
it's really good,
but when it's bad,
I go to pieces,
so if you want it,
boys,
get it here thing,
in the street,
where I lived,
I could not hold up my head,
for I gave all I had,
in another bed,
on another floor,
in the back of a car,
in the cellar,
of a church,
with a doorajar,
well I guess,
we must be looking,
for a different kind,
and we won't stop trying,
till we break up our minds,
and the sun drips blood,
on the seedy young knights,
who press you to the ground,
while shaking in fright,
I guess we could cruise up,
one more time,
with you by my side,
it'll be fine,
we'll buy some drugs,
and watch a band,
and jump in the river,
holding hands,
that final option,
the utter broken,
world weariness,
of that final romantic gesture,
after all these admissions,
that everything around us is fake,
I have planned every detail of it,
that I could plan,
I'm sure you've planned every detail,
you can too,
my set is amazing,
it even smells like a street,
we don't live on a real fucking street,
we don't live in a real fucking society,
we live in a place,
in which the deeply interlocked demands,
of sociopolitics,
and the cultural creation of iconography,
and the individual commercialized sense,
of the necessity to buy an identity,
means that everything around us,
is fucking cardboard,
all the time,
none of it is real,
and yet,
at the end of that,
hey,
you know,
if you wanna,
if you wanna go get high,
and watch a band,
and kill ourselves,
I guess that's,
that's how this kind of story is,
supposed to end,
right,
that's who we are,
that's what we do,
just a fucking incredible piece of work,
and,
um,
also very funny to me,
that,
it segues into Rebel Rebel,
because Rebel Rebel might be,
Bowie's best pure,
like,
glam rock song,
but in the context of the album,
I think,
that is the song,
that the,
the narrator of Candidate,
is talking about,
when he says,
buy some drugs,
and watch a band,
and jump in the river,
holding hands,
uh,
you are then going to that gig,
with him,
on the album,
and that's why I think,
uh,
Rebel Rebel,
despite having one of the greatest guitar riffs,
and arrangements of all time,
it's got kind of sketchy,
lazy lyrics,
they're just sort of glam cliches,
like,
oh,
your,
your,
your mother doesn't know,
if you're a boy or a girl,
I think that's completely intentional,
I think Bowie was doing that,
to demonstrate,
the exhaustion,
of something like,
um,
merely sort of,
and,
let me be careful here,
when I say this,
I am not talking about,
people with,
with,
actual,
gender identities,
other than,
cis,
het,
whatever,
I'm not talking about people who,
you know,
seriously do not fit,
into,
into that,
the,
that double dichotomy,
I'm talking about people who do,
and who kind of know that they do,
but they also like,
fucking around with being,
fimy,
or being,
you know,
butch,
or,
you know,
maybe sort of hinting that they're gay,
or maybe,
um,
having,
you know,
one lesbian encounter,
or whatever,
uh,
and not even people who just go through a phase,
that's not what I mean either,
I'm talking about people who self-consciously,
use that strategy,
to,
to accrue social capital,
and I think rebel rebel,
is,
is a,
uh,
sort of a paradoxical,
shit,
on all of those people,
that like,
oh,
oh,
that's what you like me for,
because I write songs where,
the girls might be boys,
that,
that's my whole thing,
do you,
okay,
great,
and,
um,
and then some of the,
some of the more obviously,
1984 elements,
on the back half of the album,
don't really need a whole lot of going into,
but there are a couple songs,
that I think are really fascinating,
um,
that,
that illustrate this idea of,
people,
not being forced into fascism,
people not being,
you know,
crushed,
by the,
the fucking,
Jagannath,
of fascism,
but people,
so directionless,
that they want it,
and one of those songs,
is,
uh,
Rock and Roll With Me,
the song right after Rebel Rebel,
and,
upon my first,
many,
many,
many hearings of that song,
I thought it was maybe the most,
sarcastic,
insincere song,
in Bowie's catalog,
I mean,
he sings it kind of like,
Ethel Merman,
ah,
and,
and it's got this,
really,
like,
Vegas lounge,
electric organ,
played by Garth Hudson,
from the band,
incidentally,
I should have said earlier too,
part of the reason I love Diamond Dogs,
is that,
um,
Bowie fired his band,
right before he made it,
so he plays,
a ton of the instruments,
on the album,
I believe he played,
all the guitars,
all the keyboards,
except,
Garth Hudson,
and Mike Garson's piano,
and,
uh,
I think he played,
some of the bass,
and maybe even,
some of the drums,
so it's a very,
insular,
strange sounding album,
which is part of why I love it,
but anyway,
rock and roll with me,
it sounds like,
a complete piss take,
you know,
there can be,
very few better definitions,
of,
of,
uh,
a musician,
trying to glom,
onto some kind of,
political,
or social,
you know,
cause,
just for clout,
then Bowie,
in that Ethel Merman voice,
singing,
I would take,
a foxy,
kind of stand,
well,
tens of thousands,
held me in demand,
I would take,
a foxy,
kind of stand,
beautiful,
but,
the other thing is,
this is like,
rock and roll suicide,
and I,
I don't think it's an accident,
that rock and roll,
is in the name of both of them,
because yes,
that song,
is ridiculous,
and self mythologizing,
and,
you know,
points to this kind of,
German romantic,
you know,
teenage orgasmic,
idea of transcendence,
but he also really means it,
he also really wants to tell the audience,
you're wonderful,
and,
in the same way,
rock and roll with me,
it almost hits me harder,
than rock and roll suicide,
because in the middle of this album,
about the,
the ostensible openness of culture,
the ostensible freedom,
that we have been granted,
and,
that's the key word,
granted,
leading to,
basically,
a commercialization,
of everything that used to be meaningful,
and then,
a desperation,
among those,
you know,
overly,
overly commercialized decadence,
to,
to,
dedicate themselves,
again,
to some grand,
social goal,
to all get in line,
all be told what to think,
all be told who to follow,
all worship power,
because that's,
an important point,
these fuckers,
already worship power,
it's just power to them,
is being,
you know,
the coolest guy,
at the bar,
power to them,
and being the,
the coolest girl,
on the local fucking DJ set,
if,
if they could,
if they could prostrate themselves,
in front of fucking Mussolini,
of course they would,
and yet,
even in this song,
Bowie,
whether he's in character,
or not,
however you want to take it,
this song is also true,
because,
the society he's describing,
is,
the one we have inherited,
the one where,
you know,
art in general,
has been commodified,
into a form of,
you know,
identity augmentation,
as a fucking,
boy scout badge,
to show people,
how cool you are,
and,
in,
in which the,
the most basic level,
you know,
the most unimportant level,
of permissiveness,
is so broad,
that,
people on that level,
will eventually do things,
like join the fucking army,
or go work for the,
New York Young Republicans Club,
because they're desperate,
for someone to tell them,
what to do,
but even with all that,
rock and roll with me,
it's like,
oh yeah,
listening to,
this,
listening to Bowie,
listening to any music I like,
it actually is the only,
part of my life,
where I don't want to kill myself,
it actually,
no matter how sardonic it is,
he's also right,
he,
it's also true,
that despite the,
the horrible uses,
to which all of this,
has been put,
um,
the thing itself,
is still a huge part,
of what keeps you alive,
of why it's worth,
thinking about,
at all,
and then the,
um,
the eventual denouement,
into,
uh,
Big Brother,
I mean,
that's just,
is a very broad,
encapsulation,
of,
what the entire album,
has been about,
all these former,
you know,
glammy,
dragged out,
scenester types,
putting on their fucking,
uniforms,
and ginuflecting,
in front of the new leader,
they've all decided is,
is,
not even,
you know,
an embodiment of,
their principles,
just an embodiment of,
a principle,
just,
just anything,
just please,
tell me what the highest thing,
I should worship is,
and I'll do it,
I don't fucking care what it is,
I just need to worship something,
and,
that little,
bizarre guitar break,
in the middle of that song,
to me,
is one of the great,
strange moments,
in,
uh,
in Bowie's discography,
because I think he is singing,
in that moment,
from the future,
to the present moment,
the,
the,
the part I'm talking about,
after the,
um,
I believe it's after the second chorus,
when suddenly,
it,
it cuts to two acoustic guitars,
and it almost sounds like a,
uh,
like a terrified version,
of,
of Simon and Garfunkel,
the,
I know you think,
you're,
I know you think you're awful square,
that you've made everyone,
and you've been everywhere,
but Lord,
I think you'd overdose,
if you knew what's going down,
that,
that,
that is,
uh,
in terms of,
things,
someone said in 1974,
that could be,
uh,
beamed back,
from 2074,
that's pretty high up,
on the fucking list,
and then of course,
one of the great moments,
in all of Bowie's music,
this,
you know,
gigantic,
sort of,
Apollonian,
prog rock,
Mellotron hymn,
to Big Brother,
breaking down,
into,
the final track,
uh,
chance of the ever-circling,
skeletal family,
which is,
basically,
it sounds like being,
placed in the middle,
of a,
a circle of people,
who are,
uh,
executing some kind of,
incomprehensible,
ritual dance,
as they get ready,
to tear your fucking limbs off,
and of course,
in,
in the context,
both of,
Big Brother,
the 1984 thing,
and of the,
the,
you know,
parallel narrative,
of the album,
even during that,
even while they are,
waiting to destroy you,
they call you brother,
that,
because,
your destruction,
is,
you know,
a necessary part,
of,
of the total obedience,
to whatever the new law is,
and you understand that,
and actually,
it's kind of great to die,
you don't have to think,
about anything more,
fantastic,
and the way the album,
cuts in the middle,
of a word,
that,
then,
uh,
flips into a tape loop,
that as they say brother,
during the dance,
it ends with,
bruh,
bruh,
bruh,
bruh,
bruh,
bruh,
bruh,
bruh,
bruh,
bruh,
you know,
the,
um,
the reduction,
to complete,
phonetic meaninglessness,
of one of the words,
in English,
that should be,
the most meaningful,
and,
in a lot of ways,
that is what this album,
is about,
it is about how,
uh,
you can manage,
uh,
various sorts of,
sorts of social unrest,
and also social indulgence,
until,
all meaning,
is stripped away,
from anything,
unless you,
personally,
dictate it,
to your subjects,
and,
they will not only,
accept it,
they will,
beg you for more,
and,
uh,
on the outro here,
I'm gonna do something,
I don't normally do,
I mentioned a song,
earlier,
called,
Dodo,
that,
um,
didn't make the album,
and,
there are a couple versions,
of it,
uh,
by far the best version,
is,
uh,
one that,
originally was recorded,
as a,
like,
demo cast recording,
for a musical,
if this had become,
a musical,
and,
Dodo is the perfect,
Bowie song,
to fit the 1984,
narrative,
because it's about,
knowing that people,
you know,
are,
uh,
are being tortured,
are being arrested,
uh,
drugged,
interrogated,
beaten,
lobotomized,
and,
instead of,
forming some sort of,
you know,
underground resistance front,
or raiding the prisons,
what the people do,
in this song,
is go to a fucking bar,
and spread gossip,
about,
which of their friends,
has been either,
uh,
beaten,
or drugged,
or lobotomized,
in,
into,
complete mental dysfunction,
that's,
the most David Bowie idea,
you could have,
and he's also,
fucking right,
and I've seen it happen,
enough,
in real life,
with people who have,
fucking died,
that,
no,
there's,
there's no great,
reconsideration,
there's gossip,
that's,
that's what you follow up on,
you go to the bar,
and,
you say,
you know,
in David's words,
she's a dodo,
but,
you didn't hear that from me,
music,
and we've been talking,
confidence,
did you guess,
that we've been done wrong,
that we've been done,
and,
flies jump the queue,
to be first in life,
such a shameless design,
he thinks this was screened,
from the man at the top,
it's a shame,
that his children disagree,
they cruelly decide,
to sell him down the line,
that his brain must end,
time,
he's a dodo,
dodo,
no,
no,
no,
don't hear it from me,
didn't hear it from me,
he's a dodo,
don't,
no,
no,
no,
don't hear it from me,
didn't hear it from me,
she doesn't recall,
her lesser childhood of y'all,
when a unit,
was a figure,
not a she,
when mothers chose each other,
seems to bug,
said you,
another man wants to screw,
she's a dodo,
no,
no,
no,
no,
didn't hear it from me,
didn't hear it from me,
she's a dodo,
no,
no,
didn't hear it from me,
didn't hear it from me,
can you wipe your nose,
my child,
without them slutting in your fire,
how about those that wrap,
will you sleep in fear tonight,
wait to find the scorching light,
neighbor Jim,
has come to turn you in,
no,
dodo,
no,
no,
no,
don't hear it from me,
didn't hear it from me,
don't,
dodo,
no,
no,
don't hear it from me,
didn't hear it from me,
yen,
no,
do,
do,
no,
no,
your love it from me,
didn't hear it from me.
Am I saying it was a,
granita,
but your ego,
on their part doesn't seem to tell me right now.
Don't got kerning us,
just wondering if코co race gets married.
What lines did were about these?
Weontin put to force a celebrity,
