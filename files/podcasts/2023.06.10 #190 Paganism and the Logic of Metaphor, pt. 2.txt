do
Pat Robertson?
Pat Robertson's died?
This is the first I'm hearing of this.
Wow.
What can you say?
What a life.
What an amazing life.
And whether you agree or not,
he had an amazing life
and an amazing career.
And I know, Pat, we talked many times.
He was very interested in heaven.
Heaven seemed to be his whole big thing.
You know what I mean?
And it's going to be very interesting, actually.
It's going to be very interesting.
And I have people who are working on this,
and they're telling me what they see every day.
More and more exciting, I would say.
It's going to be very exciting to see
if after all that God bull crap,
if Pat Robertson actually goes to heaven or hell.
And frankly, I wouldn't want to place any bets myself
because it is a 50-50 toss-up.
You cannot get a bookie anywhere from here to Atlantic City
to give you anything better than 50-50 odds.
So we're very excited to see that,
and we're very excited
because he is a friend of the administration
and a friend of the Republican Party.
We are very excited to hear,
if we should be so lucky perhaps,
some of his first reports from hell.
So we have a, you know, for the first time,
the other administrations, we don't do this.
Everyone's scared of going to hell,
but no one ever finds anything out about it.
How stupid are we to remain ignorant of hell this whole time?
And so we're going to be looking very heavily
into getting Pat Robertson to give us some,
you know, some live on the scene dispatches from hell.
And frankly, I think we should have been doing that years ago.
I think Bill Clinton should have been doing that.
I think, I'll even say it,
I think Ronald Reagan should have been doing that.
And that's a very exciting thing for us
so that we can, you know, begin to understand
the place where we are all going.
And what can you say?
Whether you like it or not,
an amazing guy with an amazing life.
Tuh.
Rest in shit, you motherfucker.
Pat fucking Robertson.
Ugh, Christ.
Some of you youngins may not know,
but believe me, this is significant.
First they give you everything that you want.
Then they take back everything that you have.
They live upon their feet,
and they die upon their knees,
and they can work with Satan
while they dress like the saints.
Pat Robertson is a figure who's passing,
let's say,
that is into the earth to be eaten by worms,
is I think going to be a bit underrated.
Because the political context, I think,
for people,
I don't know how old you are out there,
I don't know how many of you were American,
but there's a certain age cutoff
for which the absolute suffocation
of the evangelical Christian right
was a sort of insuperable mental obstacle,
an endless fucking feverish source of terror
for a long time.
And now, obviously,
there are still insane Christians
all over the place
giving their money to
either complete fucking nonsense
or actively pernicious
and sometimes outright genocidal activity.
But the Christian right as a block
is nowhere near as unified as it once was,
and as the Christians themselves have proven,
they don't really give a fuck
about Christianity per se in politics.
They just want someone
who's going to say some things
to placate them
and then do what they want legislatively.
I mean, I will never forget
that moment of Trump on the campaign trail
when he tried for like exactly one day
to get across to Christians
and brought out a fucking Bible
and said, folks, we love the Bible.
Don't we?
We love the Bible.
We love the art of the deal,
but we love the Bible.
And then someone asked him
what his favorite book of the Bible was
and he said, all of it.
I mean, that shit wouldn't have flown
with a Republican candidate 20 years ago.
And this is a bit of a divagation,
but given that we're talking about
not so much comparative religions
as the evolution or devolution
of the entire concept of, you know,
the sacred over time,
this is an important thing to note.
And I should say in advance,
apologies if this episode
is a little bit unusually abbreviated.
I just found out right before starting
that I have to be done at a certain time
to see my mama before she goes to the airport.
So don't worry.
I will more than make it up on the back end
because I have so goddamn much to say about all this.
But for those of you who don't remember this history
or have never looked into this history,
I think this is worth making a specific point about
because it is just a presumptive thing in the U.S. now
that the evangelical and born-again
and all the, you know, fake mini sects of Protestantism
that largely at this point define Christianity
in the United States were, you know,
they were always going to be Republican voters.
They were always going to be as right-wing
as right-wing could get within the context of,
you know, the fairly narrow spectrum
of what is still considered, you know,
electable American politics,
which is to say from the right right,
where the Democrats are,
and the extreme right, where the Republicans are.
That has just been an article of faith for decades now,
and I think sometimes people assume
that's how it always was.
But that is not the case.
And Pat Robertson was one of the key figures,
arguably the key figure,
in leading that transformation
because as, you know,
we associate born-again shit
with either, you know,
the worst kind of fucking suburban small business tyrant
or with, you know, famous people
who are having mental breakdowns, basically.
But that's not necessarily how it started.
A lot of the born-again shit,
a lot of the, you know,
neo-evangelical shit
had some affinities at the beginning
with the general sort of guru worship
and shift toward, you know,
introspection and spirituality
that followed the end of the 60s
when it became clear
that we basically had no power
and couldn't do anything
and it didn't matter
how many of us held fucking signs.
You know, every time I hear someone
talk about the Vietnam protest movement,
I think.
Yeah, you guys, man,
you managed to stop that war
after only, what, 12 years
and three and a half
to five million people dead?
God, imagine how bad
it could have been otherwise.
After this,
and I'm sure most of you will know this,
especially in an American context,
but there is this general shift
toward, well, you know,
fuck the world.
I gotta get mine.
And that get mine attitude
is very much of a piece
both in what became referred to
as New Age spirituality
and in various kinds of libertarianism.
And, of course,
it is no coincidence at all
that all the freaks
who helped create Silicon Valley
as we know it
were these exact people.
So many of them
are ex-hippies
who is,
and I hate the word introspection
because if there's one
fucking thing I know
about a Silicon Valley libertarian,
it's that he's not doing
any fucking introspection.
He would die on the spot
if he introspected anything.
But, you know,
these people who
essentially rule
a gigantic part
of the world's resources now
and have governments
that they're fucking beck and call,
even though they also
almost universally fail
to deliver anything they promise,
these are people who,
whether immediately
in a biographical sense
or sort of hereditarily
in the sense of the
institutions they arise from,
these are people
who were into,
you know,
fucking crunchy granola
Grateful Dead shit
at one point, right?
God,
seeing the chairman
of the Federal Reserve
at a Grateful Dead concert
where Jerry Garcia
is replaced by John Mayer,
that's just,
I didn't think I would ever
get to say that sentence.
And when I say
Jerry Garcia replaced
by John Mayer,
it's not like I'm calling
that an artistic travesty.
I don't fucking care.
The point is,
as I have alluded to,
I think a number of times
on this show,
there is some circumstantial
but pretty good evidence
that the CIA
from very early on
was involved
in the entire
Grateful Dead project
the same way
it was absolutely involved
in the mass production
and mass distribution
of LSD.
And so really,
you know,
what,
60 years later,
55,
the chairman
of the Federal Reserve
going to see John Mayer
in the Grateful Dead
is actually
sort of a nice bow on things.
It makes sense.
It has a,
what should I call it,
a resonant bond,
a vibrational circularity,
right?
That's how these people
love to talk.
Anyway,
Silicon Valley,
faux radical politics,
fake fucking engagement,
and then the drug-fueled
turn inward.
And though,
as I was saying,
we have now had
40,
45 years
of
sort of
neo-Christianity,
I would call it,
to distinguish it from,
you know,
Catholicism
or any of the
mainstream
Protestant branches
that have been around
for a long time.
we have associated
that with
the
extremer right end
of politics,
but this was not
always the case.
And,
in fact,
until the
movement
spearheaded
in large part
by Pat Robertson
and by his little
fucking
logistic gremlins,
people like
Richard Vigery
and Grover Norquist,
who incidentally,
I mean,
the head of the Fed
at a Grateful Dead
concert,
Grover Norquist,
one of the people
who created
fucking
mail-order
conservative
Christian politics,
he is now,
at least the last time
I knew,
a vape activist,
a vapors' rights
lobbyist,
which is,
I mean,
you know,
sometimes there's
a beauty
in all this.
That evangelical
Christian block
that to some extent
came out of,
you know,
the post-hippie,
well,
gotta get rich now
and in order to
make myself
feel better
about,
you know,
being exactly
the kind of
fucking goblin
I promised
I would never be,
I'm going to
contextualize
my rapacious thirst
for wealth and power
by saying that
it has something
to do with
self-actualization,
right?
And there was
a certain kinship
between that
general thing
and the beginnings
of modern
evangelical
and in its
current sense
of the word
Pentecostal
Christianity
and there's
obvious crossover
when you look
at groups
like, say,
the Children of God
slash Family
International,
which is just
a horrifying thing
to read about
in any depth
and also some
very, very,
very interesting
CIA connections
including the,
I don't know
if I can actually
say this,
let's just say
that a,
one of the founders
of the CIA,
a guy whose name
you might not know,
he's got some kids
whose names
you would know
and one of those kids
is known
in a particular field
for something
that has nothing
to do with any
of this
but he was
also pseudonymously
writing
completely insane
fucking Christian
fascist
political tracts
for the family
or the Children of God,
I don't know
what they were called
at the time,
Deep Roots
and all that
and in the early days
of modern
evangelical Christianity
it was just
presumed
that you wouldn't
vote.
Voting was
considered to be,
you know,
tainted,
worldly,
sinful,
that it was not
fit for a Christian
to involve him
or herself
in this filthy world
of, you know,
backstabbing
and secret deals
and handshakes
and lies.
It was,
you know,
they loved back then
to do the
render unto Caesar
what is Caesar's
and unto God
what is God's.
just like,
God,
Jesus Christ
and I'm saying that
as a form of address
not as an exclamation.
Jesus Christ,
if you could have just
not said that one
that would have been great
and then
people like
Grover Norquist
like Richard Vigery
like Pat Robertson
who had,
in Robertson's case,
you know,
he already had the
the fucking TV
shill thing down.
That guy might have
built more money
out of more scared
old people
than anybody else
who ever lived.
He is,
even politics aside,
religion aside,
all of that,
that guy
got more of
other people's
social security checks
than probably
any other figure
in American history
and
he is a
fucking
first class
scumbag
for that alone.
But
with help
from
guys like
Vigery
and Norquist
and the
growing
politicization
of the
evangelical
Christians,
Robertson,
among others,
Jerry Falwell
was of course
a huge one,
Jimmy Swigert
was a huge one,
realized,
hey,
there is this
fairly sizable
voting block
just sitting
inert
and
it's not
geographically
concentrated
in a terribly
specific way.
it's not
like,
you know,
there is a
certain part
of Arizona
where a lot
of fucking
Methodists live
or whatever.
That's a bad
example,
but you get
my point.
These people
are spread out
everywhere
and
if
I could get
essentially
political parties
to buy me
off
to then tell
these people
that
actually
voting,
it turns out,
is good
because
these men
in office,
not the men
before them,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
but these
men in office
are actually
self-consciously
using politics
to enact
the will
of God
and
that
was
the
kind of
operative
premise
of the
Republican Party
from
I would say
essentially
Reagan
until
Trump
more or
less
among
these people
I should
say
that
it was
okay
to get
involved
in
this
kind
of
politics
because
this
kind
of
politics
was
specifically
focused
on
essentially
bringing
about
the
rapture
in one
way or
another
which
helps
explain
the
extraordinarily
weird
but
very
significant
relationship
between
rich
evangelical
Christians
and
Israel
now
because
believe
me
in
1975
if
you
asked
an
evangelical
Christian
about
Israel
you
were
not
going
to
hear
anything
good
you
were
going
to
hear
some
foul
shit
and
you
probably
still
would
in
private
but
in
terms
of
policy
platforms
they
are
perhaps
the
most
Zionist
Americans
especially
as
Zionism
has
fallen
off
in
the
younger
Jewish
community
and
there
was
a bit
of a
tight
rope
to walk
politically
because
the
same
way
that
evangelism
Pentecostalism
whatever
had
certain
affinities
with that
post
60s
find
yourself
self
actualization
bullshit
it also
even though
it had
just
furiously
reactionary
social
policy
there was
often
kind of
a slight
redistributionist
angle
on
economics
and
infrastructure
the
same
way
I've
mentioned
the
fucking
Jesuit
right wing
Catholic
high school
I went
to
and
because
Catholicism
has
relied
so much
on
Latin
America
for the
last
however many
decades
as its
influence
wanes
everywhere
else
you
find this
weird
insincere
sort of
mouthing
of
social
justice
precepts
along
with all
the other
absolute
hideous
shit
you find
this
certain
genre
of both
Latin
American
politician
and
American
Catholic
with some
position of
prominence
where
the
platform
can
basically
be boiled
down
to like
okay so
we're gonna
do a
little
land
redistribution
okay
but
also
if you
see a
woman
who's
not
wearing
a veil
on
Sunday
it's
legal
to
throw
acid
in
her
face
because
the
reliance
of the
Catholic
Church
upon
Latin
America
meant
that
they
knew
if
they
were
going
to
have
any
real
chance
at
lasting
there
the
post
colonial
you know
the
post
imperial
and now
the
neo
imperial
material
situation
in Latin
America
was such
that
they
couldn't
just
outright
side
with the
fucking
groseros
you know
they couldn't
just say
yeah
landowners
same as
it's always
been
fuck you
except
now you
also have
to do
all this
religious
bullshit
in your
private
lives
and so
I would
hear this
through
you know
the course
of high
school
we would
you know
one week
this actually
happened
I don't know
if this
ever happens
at public
schools
I would
know
but
one week
we had
a guy
show up
and crowd
all thousand
of us
into the
gym
and show
us
gigantic
like
30 foot
high
projected
slides
of aborted
fetuses
and then
the next
week
you know
in fucking
theology
class
you would
hear something
vaguely
like
well
you know
everyone
in
Colombia
should have
enough to
eat
and a
place to
sleep
you know
they couldn't
entirely
do away
with that
and there
was some
of that
in
early
evangelical
Christianity
particularly
as it
related to
hippiedom
essentially
and
Pat Robertson
was one
of the
people
who helped
purge
all of
that
who helped
set up
this sort
of you know
political
triangulation
between
the
the
politicians
himself
and
the
Christians
by saying
more or
less
these are
men of
God
first and
foremost
these
aren't
politicians
that's why
it's okay
for you to
get involved
with them
because
they're
really
men of
God
who are
just doing
politics
faute de
mieux
as it
were
for lack
of a
better
option
and because
they are
men of
God
and have
my
imprimatur
as such
that also
means
that any
policy they
enact
however strange
it may seem
to you
is actually
theologically
correct
you may have
personal feelings
about destroying
the welfare
state
some of you
probably even
live on food
stamps
but if
Ronald Reagan
decides to
I don't
know
either cut
all food
stamps
or coat
them with
fucking
shellfish
toxin
so you
die as
soon as
you touch
them
you're gonna
have to
trust me
that's
actually
good
that's
actually
Christian
and of
course all
of this
was at
the express
and obvious
behest
of Robertson
not just
enriching
himself
but of
of him
amassing
appropriating
irrigating
a huge
amount of
political
influence
to himself
and to
other
you know
evangelical
or fundamentalist
Christian
figureheads
again
Falwell
would be
the obvious
example
and
Pat Robertson
loved
loved
doing
missionary
shit
in Africa
and when I
say missionary
you might
not know
exactly
what I
mean
because
what Pat
Robertson
was really
doing
was using
the
excuse
of missionary
work
to put
down
political
roots
and business
roots
all over
Africa
you know
flying over
there in
fucking
one of
probably
six private
jets
and because
private jet
perverts
have to
name them
for some
reason
you know
Lolita
Express
like
dude
too
fucking
obvious
I'm
sure
Pat
Robertson's
private
plane
was
called
like
Air
Christ
and it
was
airbrushed
on the
side
with
Jesus
hitting
the
Michael
Jordan
shot
over
Craig
Elo
in the
1989
Eastern
Conference
finals
or whatever
the fuck
that was
so Air
Christ
did some
you know
terrestrial
island
hopping
around
Africa
and in
basically
every
case
the places
Robertson
went
and the
rapports
he struck
up
were
actually
about
diamond
mining
that is
what he
cared about
in Africa
getting in
good
with politicians
and clergy
there
many of
them
if not
directly
related to
him
politically
or theologically
still
many of
them
a newly
sprung up
part of
the
evangelical
and
fundamentalist
movement
a thing
that
had not
existed
there
until
quite
recently
you see
exactly
the same
thing
in
Latin
America
in general
now
that
Catholicism
is losing
ground
at
for them
a terrifying
pace
to
you know
six foot
six guys
in fucking
shark skin
suits
with a
vest on
but no
shirt
underneath
them
and a
gigantic
wooden
crucifix
guys
named
let's
just take
the Matt
the Matt
Chrisman
classic
guys
named
Valencio
Gogert
this is
worrisome
and
my
favorite
fact
about
Pat
Robertson
is that
his
favorite
political
connection
in Africa
was
Charles
Taylor
the
murderous
Liberian
dictator
and
he
essentially
used
Charles
Taylor
as a
middleman
to get
his money
into
all sorts
of state
concerns
without
it looking
like
private
sector
investment
by an
American
and
Charles
Taylor
was also
an early
financial
supporter
of
Al Qaeda
and I
remember
you gotta be
of a certain
age to
know this
but if
you're over
I don't
know 30
you probably
remember those
like six
months when
the media
here was
trying to
convince us
that all
drug sales
eventually went
back to
Al Qaeda
this sounds
completely
fucking
fever dream
if you
weren't there
because it
is but I
promise you
this is
true
there was a
big press
campaign to
say hey
you like
smoking weed
you like to
smoke on
some weed
you like to
puff that
lounge
kush
blount
well guess
who gets
the money
when you
buy weed
that's right
Al Qaeda
Al Qaeda
is in
control
of a
global
drug
cartel
a global
syndicate
and one
way or
another
every time
you buy
your little
dime bag
of shake
that money
goes to
fucking
Al Qaeda
which
has a
little bit
of a ring
of truth
to it
in so far
as
Al Qaeda
was part
of the
CIA
and the
CIA
was selling
the drugs
so you
know
I mean
not
totally
reprehensible
on a
logical
level
but they
really
pushed that
and I
remember
this is
just purely
anecdotal
but I
remember
in the
world I
was in
at the
time
in high
school
that being
a little
bit of a
credulity
turning point
for some
of the other
people around
me
people who
were fucking
gung-ho
about the
Iraq war
and everything
else
hearing that
and going
like wait
really
I buy
weed and
Osama bin
Laden gets
ten dollars
that spurred
someone
some investigative
journalist
to have a
look into
as far as
it was
possible to
the actual
financial
holdings
of Al Qaeda
what private
sector activity
was actually
providing them
a direct
benefit
and via
Pat Robertson's
connection
to Charles
Taylor
the Liberian
dictator
Pat Robertson
and Al Qaeda
at least
briefly
at least
for I don't
know a few
days a few
weeks
co-owned a
diamond
mine
which is
you know
it's God
just slamming
a metaphor
over your
head because
he's frustrated
with how
unsubtle the
world has
become
so this
is you know
this is
partly a
divagation
but this
this also
I think
is an
excellent
crystallization
of what
happens on
the exact
other end
historically
and I
wouldn't even
say theologically
I would say
cosmologically
from what I
am calling
paganism
in the logic
of metaphor
and yeah I
know pagan
is a
is a goofy
term with
often derogatory
undertones
that's not how
I mean it at
all but
there's just
no one
better catch
all for it
and I
am going
to I
think the
next episode
is going to
be a very
thorough
examination
of exactly
what I am
talking about
when I talk
about paganism
and exactly
how that
ties into
the logic
of metaphor
which is a
term I
take from
Hart Crane
Hart Crane
one of the
the poets
writers who
and I mean
this is
flattering myself
absurdly I
realize
one of the
few people
whose work
I ever
picked up
and thought
oh holy
shit I
think like
this guy
this guy
has a mind
that reminds
me of mine
and when I
talk about
logic of
metaphor I
am not
talking about
some rhetorical
structure or
you know
syntactical
sort of
seem in
the history
of language
I'm talking
about something
much more
basic in
in the sense
of being at
the base
than that
much more
fundamental
that essentially
metaphor is
the the
human tool
for connection
with anything
in the universe
and connection
between any
part of the
universe and
any other
part and I
will dig back
to that but
the the
Pat Robertson
stuff I
felt like
was so
so beautifully
you know
just diamond
I didn't even
mean to do
that diamond
hard at the
other end of
things that I
don't think it
could be expressed
much better and
it made me
remember that
there was a
passage that I
wanted to read
in the last
one talking
about the
the other
end from
you know the
the level of
paganism
animism whatever
you want to
call it and
the essential
metaphors as
Ian Sinclair once
said to me
and if you
look at this in
terms of a
historical I
mean progression
wouldn't be the
word but a
historical sequence
I think you can
say and yes of
course this is a
generalization I
mean how are you
going to talk
about fucking
10,000 years of
history without
generalizing but
I think it is
fair to say
and and this
is what I
will do more
exegesis of on
the next episode
that there are
three sort of
essential periods
in the
relationship between
religion and
society as we
know them and
in the first
human beings
lived with
gods and I'm
not I'm not
talking about any
you know ancient
alien like you
know the the
Egyptian pharaohs
could shoot lasers
out of their
eyes type shit
I mean human
beings lived in a
world where a
god was not
something transcendent
in the philosophical
sense a god was
imminent a god in
fact would be
meaningless unless it
were imminent
imminence is the
entire fucking
point and these
gods though they
are are recorded
for us in so much
you know classical
literature as
being you know
anthropomorphic and
humanized and as
having you know
wills directio
voluntatis in in
the the theological
sense of the term
that I do not
think is really the
point and I think
they have been
misread this way
by many people for
a very very long
time and I think
in particular
because we have you
know a great deal
of access to it
sort of classical
Greek literature
from Homer up
to Sappho say
has been terribly
misunderstood by
almost everyone
and only a very
very few primarily
modernist poets
understood what the
fuck was going on
there because to
so many other people
right it is this
childish cartoon
world where you
know you snap your
fingers and the
goddess Tinkerbell
shows up to give
you a house no
that's not how it
worked at all human
beings saw gods
around them because
there were gods
around them human
beings saw gods as
as essentially
patterned energies
in nature as
patterns as
structural integrities
in the cosmos
and I will get
to that but
there is even
some debate
an interesting
debate over
whether or not
the Greek word
theos that is
pretty much always
translated as
God whether or
not it should
actually be
translated that
way that
theos contains
a whole other
set of
resonances and
implications that
are totally absent
from the word
God and
you know I
don't want to
push any Martin
Heidegger point
too far but
I do think
Heidegger was
right about
the idea that
the transformation
or rather I
should say the
transliteration and
translation of
Greek
everything really
but particularly
philosophy and
poetry into
Latin was a
kind of secret
library of
Alexandria burning
down moment
that so much
was lost from
the Greek to
the Latin and
we have just
presumed for you
know a couple
thousand years now
that it was a
more or less you
know smooth
transfer it was
not not at
all the the
very politically
and theologically
motivated way that
the the Latin
you know scholars
the Latin
orators some
awful jackass like
Cicero rendered
Greek in Latin
has all kind of
motivation behind
it that one is
expected simply to
gloss over not to
think about and
this period of
human beings
living with gods
in a very I
can't I can't
overemphasize this
enough a very
non-supernatural
way right
this gradually
gives way to
a world in
which the
gods withdraw
and now humans
live not with
gods but with
people who have
allegedly had
contact with
gods and I
I will get into
this more but
I think
imperialism and
geography has an
enormous amount to
do with it
because I think
imperialism and
geography necessitate
abstraction and
if a god in
ancient Egypt was
anything it was
the opposite of
abstract it
wasn't fucking
abstract at all
but if you
expect an entire
continent to start
adhering to your
social codes then
you have to
essentially get
rid of all
specificity and
generalize everything
up to the point
of a philosophical
thema you know
up to the point
of a moral
apotheme that
everyone is just
supposed to accept
on the basis of
you know we
know how this is
everybody knows
this this is
common knowledge
it's lying in the
back of everything
all the time we
almost don't really
even need to say
it I mean that's
sort of the essence
of certain modern
American well not
just American
Christian denominations
you know Anglicanism
fucking Episcopalianism
I can't remember who
this was it might
have been Henry
James who said
he defined
Anglicanism as
knowing perfectly
well that there is
no god but having
manners too good to
say it out loud
so we there is
this step backward
from humans with
gods and not just
humans with all
life including the
life of the earth
itself including the
life of the cosmos
the lives of the
stars and I mean
that in a precisely
literal sense there
is this move back
to to abstraction and
generality I think in
large part as a result
of politics and
economics and I'll
get more into that
to a a state in
which human beings
no longer have you
know immediate and I
mean that in the the
literal sense
unmediated contact with
any part of godhead but
they are taught to
behave as if there are
people around them who
have and the gods
themselves in the old
sense are replaced
essentially by by
saints by what will
become medieval
hagiography so you go
from living with a god
to living with people
who supposedly live with
a god and then in
the the you know you
could denominate it a
lot of ways but just
say post-world war ii
uh industrial and then
you know in some places
semi-post-industrial
american-centric
capitalist order the
position of what you
know were once the
saints the the the
cultural pride of place
for what used to be
hagiography is taken up
by media and because we
have all now seen and
lived through and known
about things that make
it basically impossible to
believe in full sincerity
in a you know an
omniscient omnipotent
benign god you know
you can have you can
have two of the three
right uh if god can
see everything and do
everything then he's
not benign if he's
benign but he can't see
everything that would
explain some shit and
personally my favorite
version of it is he's
benign but powerless
that that god created
and you know everything
within the the realm of
not just um human sensory
perception but you know
the faculties of the human
mind and the faculties for
that matter of all the
minds that aren't humans
just more or less as an
accident as a metabolic
process that god just kind
of couldn't help and now
god sees all this and this
was the you know lovecraft
joke i was making at the
beginning of the last
episode with either some
either some some kind of
you know absolutely
racking pity and sorrow
because god cannot do
anything about it or with a
a complete impossible to
imagine uh unassignable
alienness an extremity of
foreignness that is beyond
all conception but we
still have this place
right we still have this
thing this pedestal that
has been part of of human
society for as long as
there has been a human
society and depending on
how you define that word
arguably uh much earlier
than that i mean there are
uh there are religious
artifacts you know you have
to have my particular sense
of what religion means but
it's true there are
religious artifacts that
are two hundred thousand
years old you know the
cave paintings this is why
or part of why those were
such a big deal to see not
only the artistic
sophistication and assurance
but also the evident um
imminent mysticism imminent
contact with the gods of the
earth in artwork that was so
god damn old and we still
have that place but the
gods are gone and now the
saints are gone and so we
have to replace the saints
essentially with media we
allow the saints uh to be
replaced by the machinations
of the culture industry because
we would all go fucking crazy if
we had to believe and i mean
really believe you know a lot
of people out there call
themselves atheists whatever
most of them don't believe
this that your life as you
live it as you experience it
and i don't just mean in terms
of events i mean the entire
the entire spectrum of sensory
imaginative uh intellectual
fucking oniric experience you
have that that is really all
there is and that no one
anywhere else has anything
more than that and that even
if perchance you know some
some miraculous prodigy did
have more than that it'll never
matter because you can never
fucking get there ever you are
trapped in the fucking prison of
your skull until you die and
there is absolutely no recourse to
anything else i know some people
who say they believe things like
that um i observe their activity
and the other things they say and
i conclude they don't really
believe that they uh they like to
make others think they believe it
because it seems bold and courageous
and intellectually honest and like
you know they're out there on the
fucking edge man they're out there in
the wind suffering for all of us
they don't believe that shit and
their primary aid i think in not
really believing that shit is media
is the culture industry because the
the lives that we in the you know
hagiographic period imagine to be the
lives of the saints the the imaginary
lives of those people so blessed or
cursed as to have direct contact with
the gods um that position really
needs to stay filled even though we uh
we have grown largely past uh the the
sincere conception of sainthood and
so instead we use uh celebrity and
particularly the mediatized uh presentation
of celebrity because be it said um i i
kind of hate people talking about
celebrity or fame just unto itself
because there's no such thing as fame
unto itself no one is out there being
famous without appearing in media
that's not how it works there there is no
fame extricable from the you know very
very very complex very uh tiered and
stratified very expensive presentation
of that fame nobody's just famous don't
work like that and i think the media
presentation of that fame is far more
important than the idea of celebrity
unto itself even when i would say
especially when that presentation that
that that packaging that sort of uh
exegesis of fame is being done not in
the literal sense by the culture industry
not not in the sense that it has been
planned exactly like this and it is being
delivered to you uh full scale finished
product you got nothing to add to it
no i i think that's even more powerful
powerful and more true when uh people
start to take on what they imagine is a
creative role in other people's fame
and which is almost inevitably a uh
deeply deeply paranoid one and sometimes
an outright schizophrenic one you know
i've never paid any attention in my life
to taylor swift because her music is
fucking terrible and she seems like a
deeply uninteresting person but i have been
fascinated thanks to the adam friedland
show to see people reacting to shit
around her and to realize oh this is why
she's so fucking famous it's not the
songs who gives a fuck about the songs
you could stick any half competent singer
with any half competent songwriter and
producer and churn that shit out all day
long uh it is the invitation to paranoid
schizophrenic participation in what you
imagine her own life to be in in the the
stratum where the saints died the stratum
littered with the corpses of dead gods you
now think you get to play a role in helping
essentially to refine and shape her
hagiography and i know people have brought
this up um strictly as a joke as for purposes
of ridicule already and believe me it
deserves to be ridiculed i'm not going past
that but um someone i i think a middle-aged
woman maybe who was doing a series of i think
tick tocks man other than twitter i don't
know shit about social media sites let's just
say they were tick tocks about how taylor
swift's relationship with the fucking guy
from the 1975 who incidentally are like the
least offensive band that ever existed
they're horny cold play that's it and and
this woman was proffering the explanation
that taylor swift was dating this man who
seemed so wildly inappropriate for for her
cluster of publicly signified virtues because
it was performance art she's doing a vast
piece of performance art about uh the way
that you know women are devalued particularly
by other famous powerful men and then she's
going to strike back rise like a phoenix from
the ashes of the 1975s come and and present us with
some incredible piece of work about overcoming all
of that um and that is fascinating to me because
first of all it's insane it's flagrantly insane that
is that is a wild thing to believe but the other
reason it's interesting is that it is insane in the
right way for the mediatization of the the dead divine for for
the culture industry equivalent of the the fucking withered saint
because there is an excellent chance that whatever taylor swift was
actually doing in her life whatever was going on in her fucking
mind she will now use all of that not just the thing itself
but all the media coverage of it in exactly the way this fucking insane
woman is suggesting and this is a phenomenon that since
since sort of paying some attention to popular culture again
i was for various reasons i was pretty much completely off the map
from like 2010 to 2016 anyone who got famous in those years i still don't
really know who they are and what i observed when i came back is that
thanks in part obviously to the sheer mechanics of social media
but thanks i would also say to a certain kind of uh
not just end of history because that has all the fucking francis fukuyama baggage
all the you know inevitable inevitable victory of liberal capitalist
democracy not end of history but end of world
basically certainly the end of world any world that you know and uh very
possibly the end of the world completely i mean sometime if you haven't
you you really got to sit down with yourself and and recognize it it is it's
not just like a fringe possibility it's a real serious uh eventuality that
everyone and everything you know could be dead by 2050 and i'm not even talking
about nuclear war i am just talking about the exponential pace
of environmental collapse i don't um i don't take any joy in making you think
about that but i do think it's something everybody should do because if if you're
still living in denial that we have 50 years 100 years anything more than that to
figure this out who uh you're gonna need to reorient yourself around some of this
shit and i think that end of world desperation that i'm talking about
it marries with celebrity and with the technological opportunities afforded by
social media in a fascinating and a deeply troubling way
because what i noticed after those years in the wilderness uh when i came back and
started you know paying more attention to what was quote unquote going on i realized
oh so much of this shit is not about this person or this song or this movie or
whatever so much of this is driven by the manic ideations of the fans that's what
they actually care about the music fuck the music it's about getting in some you know
receptive audience to spit out your asylum worthy theories about what all of this means
and to be approved of and even perhaps expanded upon by other fans and then and this is the part
that killed me and still does the the famous people themselves are aware of all this they see it
they see all of it going on and they use it now that celebrities directly draw the the mediatized
arcs of of their lives of their work whatever work it is they do from just fever dream speculation
about them or i would say you know not even speculation because speculation implies that um if one were to be
proven wrong one would then stop believing so right and that's not how this shit works this is this is
past hagiography this is past sainthood and in a way it is all the way back to scriptural exegesis
these fandoms i hate that word but it's the word these fandoms treat things like a holy text
not in the sense that they are to be absolutely obeyed or taken precisely as you know the ultimate authority
but in exactly the opposite way that the holy text is the holy text because it contains any possible text
right there is a um a particular aspect of of kabbalah that really fascinates me uh in which certain kabbalists
believe that the entire torah is uh is out of order right now all the letters are in the wrong places
and the torah is a living document that biologically rearranges itself in different times and different
places for the the necessities or pressures that it faces and that when we come to some port some point of
of revelation or messianic deliverance then and only then for the first time will the torah arrange
itself in the right order and show us what it's secretly been saying this entire time and of course
that plugs in deeply to uh to another kabbalistic uh aspect of esoteric judaism gematria the idea that um
there are hidden messages all throughout scripture in the form of numerological correspondences between
numbers and letters and that is how people are treating fame now fame has become basically how you do
kabbalah on instagram and the the omnipotence the uh how should i say the primordial uh
ontology the primordial existence of the text whatever that text is whether it's you know the pintatook or
fucking taylor swift it exists as such not because it is what it is and your your job is to reckon with
that it exists as such because it's anything it's anything you want it to be but behind the anything you
want it to be you still have the scriptural authority of the text right so as long as you've got the
book you can say it says anything and then argue about it with other people who read the book and
don't see that but it is not simply you creating this by yourself and that is key that is the the essence of
the theological aspect of of celebrity and media at this point that if you just make up this worldview
on your own you would be either you know derided as a completely delusional person or in some quarters
celebrated as an artist but not many of the latter but if you can attach it to some aspect of culture
industry scripture all of a sudden you have a claim to authority beyond even the scripture itself
and to every possible relation between that scripture and every other possible thing and each of those
other things is in itself an infinitely hermeneutic scripture that can be tied to anything there is this
kind of proliferating fractal scripturalist delirium that that i think is um a fascinating and also
very frightening way to see how um to see how the the place of the culture industry has usurped the place
of you know whatever useful role uh conventional religion once played and uh in in thinking of that
i wanted to end with actually a quote i meant to read uh last time uh from uh libra the don delillo book
about jfk assassination and you know i i don't agree with or completely sign off on on delillo's idea of
how the assassination happened but that's not the point the point i think is in his his otherworldly
capturing of the thought process of lee harvey oswald as someone who has spent his entire life
desperately trying to break into that thing i call the iconosphere that you know our real lives out here
are fake that's not the real world the real world is what happens on tv the real world is what happens in
the movies and the people on tv and the people on the movies if you see them on the street those aren't
the same people those are doubles those are fakes those are golems there there is this violent gnostic
division between uh the the image presented uh via media and the person who is the kind of ultimate
substratum of that image they are not the same thing at all and i mean there is a lot of reason to
believe that there is some kind of much deeper and more systematic involvement and almost every
assassination of a famous person that happens for no obvious reason like say john lennon or bob marley but
putting that aside for a moment i think that is a a part of the root of why people um either
you know want to do violence to famous people or want to do violence to themselves uh in sort of the name
of those famous people because there is this uh there is this desperate feeling there actually there's
a a a psychiatric term for this it's called cap grad delusion it's uh the main feature of my god if you
want to read a book that is going to permanently break part of your mind right behind one of your eyes
uh memoirs of my nervous illness by daniel paul schreiber who was a german high court judge in the late 1800s
who uh became a paranoid schizophrenic and who uh because of his training his background his job
left an extremely detailed account of his schizophrenia and what is deeply unsettling about it
is that he is not recording this as in here's what i thought here are the crazy delusions i had
he is recording uh what we would call his delusions in a forensic legalistic way trying to prove through
the same logic he would use in a court case yeah so obviously uh every bird is fake all birds are
machinery and um the birds are created by god who is actually a gigantic knot of nerve tissue who lives at
the center of the center of the universe uh so that they can torture me by being fake it's it's a mind
shredding book and one of the uh the subsequent explanations or attempts at explanation for that book
uh is a psychiatric condition called cap grad delusion in which you believe that either the people around
you the things around you are somehow fake they've suddenly become fake you can't you can't describe
why you don't know what it means but all of a sudden you you look at your wife and think that's not her
you look at your dog you think that's not her you look at your house you think this isn't this isn't
where i live it looks like the place where i live but this isn't it uh or you think that uh
uh this this fakeness is an uh increasing step-by-step trend not just that everything's fake all of a
sudden but that one by one things are being disappeared and replaced with fakes and uh as i've heard of it i i
you know don't know the science on this very well i believe the theory for it is that it has to do with
um some dysfunction of the amygdala yeah i really butchered that amygdala um a dysfunction in the
emotions you're supposed to feel when you recognize something familiar that essentially your brain just
stops going through the process of you know sending out whatever neurotransmitters uh have to do with
familiarity and recognition and you see everything as if you've never seen it before and uh i think
that is a key a route to understanding of media and celebrity at this point in history and particularly
as a replacement for theology because there is this utterly i mean in the deepest sense of the word
schizoid split divide between the image which is what is real remember the image is real and then
the person uh from whom that image was wrong the person who was built into that image that's not real if i
can see a celebrity walking down the street then it must not be her that's not taylor swift there's a
taylor swift double walking around and so with uh with that in mind i'm going to leave you from uh leave
you with rather one of my favorite scenes from libra where uh oswald uh his his wife and child are living
with ruth payne the cia operative and uh he goes over to see them uh not expecting anything particularly
good and delillo writes just a moment here lee sat in the dining room at the pain house wondering where
the women had sneaked off to then marina and ruth walked in carrying a cake and singing happy birthday
he was taken by surprise it was a shock he laughed and cried 24 he stayed over that night a friday and the
next evening he sat on the floor watching a double feature on tv with marina curled up next to him
her head in his lap the first movie was suddenly frank sinatra is a combat veteran who comes to a small
town and takes over a house that overlooks the railroad depot he is here to assassinate the president
lee felt a stillness around him he had an eerie sense that he was being watched for his reaction
the president is scheduled to arrive by train later in the day he's going fishing in a river in the
mountains lee could tell that the movie was made in the 50s from the cars and hairstyles which meant
the president was eisenhower though no one said his name he felt connected to the events on the screen
it was like secret instructions entering the network of signals and broadcast bands the whole busy air of
transmission marina was asleep they were running a message through the night into his skin
frank sinatra sets up a high-powered rifle in the window and waits for the train to arrive lee knew he would
fail it was in the end a movie they had to fix it so he failed and died
