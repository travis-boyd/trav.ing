Let's go.
meeting of the international conference of technological psychiatry and folks i uh
i hate to say it and when i say i hate to say it i mean i hate to say it that that's where
your god is now instead of actual living gods literally tangible gods uh you have in the place
of the divine the the artificial hypostasis the the fake flesh of the scientific method
a deification essentially of a human being's own estimate of their reasoning powers a deification
of human wisdom for whatever that's worth and anything you can justify in terms of the scientific
method they're gonna let you do that at least once especially if you have a sick tagline afterward
to prove that actually it's bad and you know it's bad i am become that's the destroyer of worlds
like oh dude if you got that they're not gonna let you do it once they're gonna let you do it as many
fucking times as you want to it's crazy i mean i have in the last let's see what would it be
last uh call it seven years i have had at least three that i can think of maybe more uh psychiatrists
who want to give me electroshock you can call it electroconvulsive therapy you can pretty it up or
latinize it however you want but it's electroshock and i know i know if i were to leave it there
someone would show up and say well actually it does help some people yeah i know it does help some
people and the problem is they have no idea which people those people are going to be until it's too
fucking late and they also they don't know why it works when it works and they don't know why it
doesn't work when it doesn't work but shit you know if you've got enough clinical data really
whatever the clinical data actually says and enough money which is the key part in keeping that
clinical data respectable you can do anything you goddamn want that's your god now right but
but i gotta say there is there is pulp and lymph inside the wires there is blood and pus and spit
to downshift every slew rate on the diodes it's flesh out there it's just uh confabulated flesh
i think uh i think it's interesting that uh when william burroughs was first getting sort of prominent
as a writer and he was being you know denounced from all sides is merely surrealistic pornographic
scatology uh marshall mcclellan the uh you know medium is the message guy he's not necessarily the
kind of person you would expect to be reading william burroughs but he was one of the first guys who got
burroughs and he wrote an important early review in the early 60s i think around the time burroughs would
have been doing the nova trilogy the uh the soft machine the ticket that exploded and nova express which
is in some ways burroughs best book and he said that there is something in burroughs about the
relationship between humanity and technology that no other writer has managed to catch this being of
course you know the the height of the cold war the years the cia was conducting the fucking genocides
all over the world and uh killing their own president and so forth so the idea of or rather the question of
human relation to technology was a very live one people were real worried about it and for good
fucking reason you know the the extent to which technology uh mattered in the life of every citizen
of this country had exploded had grown more than exponentially over just the last you know 15 years or so
i mean that's part of why it has long been a contention of mine that people people who were alive in 1960
let alone now have less to do with people who were alive in 1900 than people who were alive in 1900 have to
do with people who were alive in 1100 we are alienated from the entire past of our species in a way that
i mean of course something like this has to remain an open question because we're not exactly great at
you know understanding degrees of alienation between eels let's say but to the extent that we do know
i don't know if a single species has ever been so alienated from its own past self and has kept such
good records of that alienation you know those of us who have lived after the after or during the height of
the cold war and especially now especially in the you know the fucking omnisphere of total
mediatization we are not like people who came before us there's a reason you're not like your
grandparents and it's not just matters of personal circumstance you have very nearly been turned into
a separate species and that is what mcluhen said about william burroughs that he gets to something
crucial about the the interaction between human beings and technology because what burroughs understands
and this is me quoting mcluhen now is that technology is an exteriorization of the human nervous system
we would all like to pretend it's cold and mechanical and robotic and therefore objective
and we talk about its coldness with you know sort of feigned terror like what would the machines not
do if simply left to their own devices but really we love that we love the idea that we are you know
giving birth to an unstoppable para species of indomitable machines because that means it's not
our fault it means whatever the machines do they are doing by the lights of their own version of
objectivity right and that's complete fucking nonsense every machine came from an animal trying to project
its own powers into some other domain every machine came from an animal trying to metamorphose to transmute
its cognitive powers into some other kind of power into the power of the speed of computation
or strength to lift and move things or speed of travel every one of those is a thought then made flesh
and as such is a very bleak parody of the incarnation and that is you know i've talked about catholicism a
fair amount on here i am not by any stretch of the imagination a christian but there are things from
catholicism that are always going to stick with me and to me that's the core of it the idea of
incarnation and especially the incarnation of the word right that the word was with god
and the word was god and that whatever hope we have is the hope of the word made flesh i believe that
completely because for proof if we're trying to be scientific about it of the idea of the word made flesh you
need look no further than what is happening right now i said some words and i managed to trap the air that
vibrated there with a little diaphragm vibrating inside of a microphone and send it to some wires
and put it into a computer so that you could hear it and as i speak words are doing things inside of
your brain words that are not mine anymore right they were mine at one point but by the time you hear it
they're not anybody's they they simply exist out there in the cosmic radiation background and yet
you hear them or read them or however you take them in and something happens in your brain something
happens in your nervous system something happens in even perhaps uh the non-cognitive parts of your
nervous system something adrenal you know something i hope not but immunological uh something hormonal
who knows that is literally the word made flesh that is the point that once the word leaves you
the word then incarnates in someone else and those incarnations may be dreadful they may be horrifying
they may be some of the worst things human beings have ever done some of the worst things human beings
have ever had happen to them and that's why you have to do it with a real tenacious degree of
responsibility i think because the word is made flesh over and over every day i believe in that
transmutation i believe in that as much as i believe in anything else in the world and so the idea that
technology is this cold unfeeling dangerous other precisely because it is so rational and predictable
and objective and objective and uncaring number one no it's not nothing human beings ever make
can be entirely separate from the cognition that went into its design and construction you taught it to think
like that so to the to the degree that it really thinks at all uh it's your fault man if you built
something that you're now afraid is going to kill you maybe learn a little bit from that uh but of course
the idea that it's really you know objective and separate is fucking nonsense it's just an exteriorized
version of a desire on the part of its creators and perhaps even more importantly financial backers
to uh to promote whatever it is that they want whatever it is they think everybody else should believe
as objective and scientific you know computer says no if if the machine says no i guess i mean
ah i know i know this is hard to bear with sometimes but you just got to admit if i build a machine to
tell me i'm right all the time and then the machine tells me i'm right all the time i mean what are you
gonna do that's objectivity it's science and i think that is getting rather far afield now but this is
interesting to me i think that is behind the insane overreaction to some absolute fucking nonsense like
ai you're seeing you were seeing it more you know a few months ago but still chat gpt and all that shit
that you know people breathlessly posting like chat gpt taught itself to do chemistry we didn't program
that in it's growing at a terrifying speed motherfucker no it's not what you did was you built a search
engine that instead of responding to searches with addresses for websites calls the information from
those websites and responds to searches in the form of paragraphs that could plausibly have been
written by a human being that's not learning it's not learning anything it's just a different
fucking presentation but i think the way people insist on that their love for talking about
you know the fascinating potential but terrifying danger of that is rooted in this desire to believe
that they have made something truly exterior that they have made something that is in no one in no way
marked by them having made it which is bullshit i mean i remember i don't know three four months ago maybe
uh a clip doing the rounds of an ai generated movie preview and people on the tech side you know
captioning it or tweeting over it like hollywood should be very very afraid right now and it was just
hilariously wretched it would i mean it could hardly show a human face everybody in the fucking preview
was seen from behind because ai can't really do facial expressions yet and it had this this
preposterous you know music from no actual era it didn't look like any time in human history it did
it was wretched it was unbelievably bad and yet i think some of these people when they do this sort of hype
work yeah a lot of them are just doing it in complete bad faith because they have some kind of
financial financial financial or professional interest in people taking this bullshit seriously but i think
others of them are deliriously excited by the idea that see i made an objective machine and whatever the
machine says we gotta do and if it just so happens that the machine which i made uh always says the same
things i say i mean you gotta chalk that up to lady luck roll them bones and just accept that i was
already right all the time and and i think that is a key to the whole root of you know singularity
thinking that i uh in the early days of the show i did several episodes about the idea of the singularity
and how i think that is sort of a a a crypto key to understanding a lot of the worst things in
contemporary thought and its ramifications economically and sociologically and the fantasy
of the singularity is essentially that a machine will take on consciousness and in as such merge with
human consciousness but the it already is merged with human consciousness because humans fucking built
it and if we get to this the point the singularitarians love to talk about where it's like
oh god our computers are designing their own computers no no what you designed into computers
is then going on to design something else there's nothing new about it there's nothing separate
you're still the fucking guy behind the curtain the machine is just doing a more elaborate and more
sort of uh i suppose you would say metatextual metagonic how about that let's coin a fucking term
version of what every fucking machine does i mean that's like you know building a fucking mill wheel
to help to help grind fucking flour and then it rains and the river swells and it pushes the wheel and you go
oh my god the mill wheel is making it rain more come on nobody would take that shit seriously
so with that as sort of preface against the kind of thing uh we've been talking about here for a
little while let me give you a couple little a couple clusters a couple glyphs as i have been calling
them a couple logographs so as to uh you know make some words flesh so as to get it into
your head and more than just your head as as a sensory reality rather than than just a uh a spoken
formulation so a couple of my favorites a couple i meant to talk about last time
you go back to the theogony the uh the documents on the uh genealogy essentially of what would become
the greco-roman gods we're talking about he's heod here we're talking about i think he wrote around
a thousand bc something like that and so uranus to the greeks or uranus to uh the romans sky god right
uh gaia to the greeks terra to the romans earth goddess and uranus and gaia mate and their progeny
is chronos or uh saturn right now think of what think of what is going on right there that is not
just some arbitrary like well every god's got to come from somewhere so these two fucked and it made
this one no no no think of the astonishment and and the the oracular foresight in that little equation
sky plus earth equals time just sit with that for a second and and when i say sky here we have to
differentiate sky from the the abstraction of just space or cosmos or whatever sky as
the the the thing that for most of history human beings have thought as sort of binding the
contents of the earth together right the the the notion that it's just sort of like space except
there's stuff in it and then there's an atmospheric layer and then it's just you know emptiness out there
that is a very new notion for for most of human history we have thought of the sky as the the kind of
the shell right the context so you have the the shell of context you have the generative earth
and from that you get time and there is a naturalistic way to talk about that right sky brings thunder
lightning rain snow drought and these affect not just the offspring of the earth not just what earth
grows but how earth grows them and where and how long it takes and the various stages of development
so this is one way to understand how sky plus earth equals time the idea of the time of growing
right the the the cyclical not just seasons but you know well seasons would be one from the macro
structural uh cycle of the cycle of the cycle of the micro structural cycle of cell birth and cell
degeneration and metabolism and and every growth process in any terrestrial organism right so if you
want to be sort of a naturalist about it you can explain it that way too but to me far more interesting
and also far more kind of um not troubling exactly because it's not bad but sort of uh sort of stop you in
your tracks and make you go oh shit is the idea that sky and earth meet at a horizon that becomes time
because earth alone is you know fertile but unfecundated unfertilized sky alone has nothing to enclose
sky alone is just you know a membrane without context put them together and suddenly you have things living
upon this earth that now have that sky as the shared context for existence
that now see themselves as being in some way related in some way kindred because they are beneath the same sky
and not just literally but because they know the element of time here is also the element of growth and death
right and so time becomes the horizon against which events are defined you know this is this is basic heidegger
right being towards death that it is the knowledge that we are going to die that sort of retroactively
retrospectively grants any meaning to what it was that we did there's a great uh anecdote about uh
james joyce talking to his brother uh stanislaus around the time that he was writing dubliners
and any of you who know that book there's a story i believe it's a story called a painful case
about a uh sort of middle-aged sad lonely woman and man who have uh a meek sort of flirtation that the man
then decides to sort of throw off and the woman throws herself in front of a train and dies
and um i don't know if if this conversation led directly to that story but i i sort of have to
think it did because joyce was attempting to explain sort of his methodology what he was trying to do
in dubliners and they were standing on a train platform and joyce pointed to someone and said to
his brother imagine that man jumps in front of this next train or imagine that man gets on this train
and then the train crashes or imagine that man slips and is crushed by the train his death
retroactively will grant an enormous amount of meaning to everything that led up to it because
all the quotidian perfunctory details that you and i would not care about the vast majority of the time
you know is he wearing new shoes what did he eat for breakfast did he skip breakfast
does he smoke but today he's trying not to smoke did he just start smoking is he hung over is is he
trying to get sober where does he live how did he get here did he walk here does he usually walk
is he tired because he doesn't usually walk is he feeling fucking springy and fresh the walk did him good
all of that all of that all of that now becomes meaningful in relation to the role it plays in his death and i think you know
obviously i have talked a lot about the deaths of famous people on this show and i have never the last thing i ever
fucking wanted well not the last but one of the last things was to be considered an assassination buff
fucking yeah disgusting a kennedy guy fuck out of here i i have no interest in being part of that sphere of
people who just latch on to celebrity deaths as subject matter because it gets them attention and also
because there is some sort of not necessarily prurient thrill they get from it but something a little
bit perverse at least emotionally perverse if not sexually and obviously there are a lot of reasons
behind all that but i think one of the key reasons is the amount of documentation we have
for dead famous people the amount we know i mean at 12 13 years old i could tell you everything everything
that was publicly known about the crime scene where kurt cobain died i could tell you everything that has
ever you know made it out of the official police reports why why did i care why does anyone care why can't you
get people arguing over you know the number and type and order of medications marilyn monroe took when she died
why is that important because we have the death right as a marker as a kind of think of it like a magnet
the death forms this electromagnetic core this pulse shooting out waves in all direction past and future right
and all of the little things that you would never have cared about you would never have even thought to notice
all of a sudden those are magnetized by the fact of death into becoming meaning into becoming significance
and the more you learn every little one you learn casts that central core that death in a different light
and though this happens on large scale mostly for celebrities um to you and the people you know and the people you care about
this will also be true of of you specifically and of the people you love specifically and when they die
especially if they die in unexpected ways you will be racking your brain trying to think back to what should have warned you
to what should have been perceived as a what ezra pound would call luminous detail all the little shit you overlooked and thought
yeah you know whatever that's not really important oh he just does that yeah it's a weird habit of his i don't know whatever
all of that will become meaningful retroactively there's this astonishing power
of of of not just history in the past but death to confer you know luminous meaning upon everything that came before death
and of course in a situation like a war let's say or a situation like a genocidal coup where there's really only one side fighting
a situation like dropping fucking atomic bombs on japan you now have an endless corpus of material
that you could study for the rest of your life trying to grasp the way this event has conferred post hoc significance
on every detail i mean as i remember it it's been a long time since i read it but uh is it john hershey's book
hiroshima is is just the the narratives of i think a couple dozen people who were there and died that day
there's no as i recall there's no attempt really at a narrative through line it's just saying what happened
and no one would write that book no one would write that book about vienna on the day we dropped the atomic bombs
in japan the details are all there there is just as much to know the information can be magnetized to
that center half a world away if you really work at it but nobody's interested it it's the scale of mass
death that makes things retroactively meaningful and that that's horrifying on one hand it's also
completely understandable on the other hand and we think back to you know talking about the old gods
whatever you want to call them paganism and so on and so on you know there is always a god of death
who is often as i pointed out in the last episode thinking about gods like thoth and hermes and anubis
one for whom i have a particular sort of i don't know what you devotion is not the word but feel like
i have a particular sort of patron relationship with and these gods of death primarily are not
evil they're grim they're frightening they're bleak in some ways but but they're not murderers
that's not the point the point isn't that they come and kill you the point is that they are the the
psychopomps the psychopompous the the leaders who guide you across the line between worlds and i think
the fact that so many of them are also associated with writing and language and codes and encryption
is anything but accidental because as with death writing is something that accrues meaning
afterwards as much as meaning is put into it meaning also begins to radiate from it afterwards because
of the context in which it was set down you know the the the note on the table that says your wife is
going to you know the gas station that doesn't mean much of anything by itself you go oh my wife is
going to the gas station the note on the table that says your wife is going to the gas station and then
she dies in a car wreck all of a sudden that note is the most brutal unbearable heartbreaking thing
you've ever fucking seen this is how writing works because writing and there's a whole lot of this stuff in
derrida and a lot of that is in response to socrates plato aristotle writing is the language of those
who are absent if you're reading something it's because the person who wrote it isn't there most of
the time and we're talking about writing here particularly not just in the context of literature
but in the context of anything written especially records especially you know just information
so the fact of the presence of writing means the absence of the author so there's this absence
this zero this black hole inscribed at the heart of all writing and as that absence is magnified by the
passage of subsequent time that black hole becomes a more and more indomitable gravitational force
pulling more and more meaning into it and it is partially this process of you know internal gravitation you could call it
of centripetal force i believe it would be that lends the written character this this thing i've talked about is radiation
this way it transfers waves of various frequencies and and genera straight into your brain and alters you which of course in turn alters everything you see which in turn alters you again and creates this never ending feedback loop of what i was referring to earlier as the incarnation
there's a term from uh electric circuit design uh called self-oscillation and those of you who have ever uh
fucked around with like delay pedals for instance like a memory man does this really well in a delay pedal right
it's it's an echo is how most people would think of it you play something and then the pedal echoes it back
at a set number of times at a set uh distance from the original so it can be one real quick slapback echo
like but or it can be set for longer ones like but
and there is a component on most of these devices called feedback
and feedback you you know what it means in the general sense right but we're not talking about feedback like you know
mechanical whining noises feedback in this sense means you take part of the output
of the circuit part of the thing the circuit is meant to produce and you feed it back into the input
of the circuit and so the circuit is not just now acting on echoing the original signal
now it's beginning to echo its own echoes and if you turn that feedback up high enough
you will induce a state that's called self-oscillation where the the combination of the regular input
you know the guitar or whatever you're playing and the feedback the output that's looped back around
to the input reaches a a volume and a saturation over the pedals normal output over the echo that is
supposed to be supposed to be happening right and because there is always new echo being fed back to the
beginning fed back to the beginning over and over and over uh the circuit basically begins to eat its own
signal alive and to get exponentially louder and wilder and more broken and you end up you can turn you know
one quiet note into this sort of metal rending mechanical howl by just making sure the feedback cycles through
enough times and that is what self-oscillation is it's it's when the uh the operation of a circuit or machine
generates an effect that then gets fed back into its own inputs there's a part in uh gravity's rainbow about uh
franz pöckler at penemünde uh and uh the the mittelwerke the rocket facilities where he's talking about uh
problems in design with the rocket and one of them is that uh the the chambers for the thrusters in the rocket
were going into self-oscillation and what he means there is that the the sound these things are generating
or you wouldn't even really perceive it as sound it would be so fucking loud you couldn't make it out
but the vibrations these things are generating right well instead of just staying in the thrusters
themselves instead of just shaking around those vibrations are making the whole chamber shake the
whole interior shake and the more the thrusters shake the more the interior shakes and then the more
that interior shaking is transferred back into the thrusters which then makes them shake more which
then makes the interior shake more everything is feeding back into everything else all the time on
an exponential curve and so uh what there's there's a line in there something like the rockets on the
test stand bucky bucking and whinnying like horses literally shrieking themselves to pieces that is
self-oscillation and something very much like that happens with the the radiation output of the written
word that it goes back into you and you back into it and it back into you and you back into it so many
times that it induces this state of harmonic oscillation between you and everything outside of you and
not many factors can make that happen more powerfully than death not many things uh lend more significance
lend a greater depth of uh i guess what you could kind of call implicit mystery or a greater depth of the
feeling that you are brushing against something truly enigmatic that you are really having a glimpse
into the heart of the labyrinth you know you can see and hear the minotaur all of a sudden and you realize
that uh instead of being this you know horrible murderous beast at the core of this maze the labyrinth or
rather the minotaur is terrified that you haven't been walled out the minotaur has been walled in
and that sets up this this you know this feedback self-oscillation cycle that eventually can spill over
into total harmonic noise and rip things apart and those things in the case of languages are often human
minds you know i have had at least chance interactions with a lot of people uh doing the kind of work that i do
who know a lot in factual terms about say the kennedy assassination and and i thank them for all the
worthwhile information they've given me but i can also see that for anyone who focuses too sincerely
for too long on something like that it kind of tears your brain in half it's sort of impossible
to go back to doing anything the way you used to do it and in a way that's the most honest and sincere
reaction it should fucking tear your brain in half right we shouldn't be able to know the things we know
and continue functioning that's bizarre but somehow we do and part of that no doubt is is you know something
psychological in the deepest sense you know part of it is something neurochemical i imagine a huge amount of it
is social conditioning and not just in the uh you know the the obviously manipulative sense of trying
to make you not pay attention or not care but social conditioning simply in terms of being uh being told
what's important and what's not over and over again what you should think about all the time and what you
shouldn't it's it's amazing that we ever get past that but i see some people who have clearly
gotten into this inescapable feedback loop and when the self-oscillation loop happens in a good way
it's the greatest feeling in the world i mean i i think that is at the very core of almost everything
in my life that i have really really cared about and really really loved because that's what any kind
art form is you put something into the art it gives something back to you that changes what you're
going to do next and there is this feedback cycle i think that is at the core of the the the deepest
and truest kinds of love for other people that you're not simply either projecting things onto them
and appreciating them for being blank screens which is what a whole lot of motherfuckers think love is
and you're also not just enjoying them horrible word instrumentally in the sense that oh you know
they bring this this this and this to my toolkit they bring a pretty smart blonde short rich you know
what whatever concatenation of attributes you want to list the realist love i think is the sort that
induces this kind of self-oscillating feedback right it's that anything you give to someone
that person transmutes metamorphoses gives back to you in a form you could not have foreseen
and that changes what you're going to do and when you change it changes what that person is going to do
i mean that if if if that's not kind of the root of human love i don't really know what is that's
certainly how i have experienced it uh in the times when it was most meaningful but that shit can also
tear your brain apart and i think having death at the core of that kind of glyph you know death as the
some of you probably know that spiral galaxies are built around uh black holes that were often
made of exploded stars and because language in itself and and spoken language to a degree but
especially written language are by definition the language of people who aren't there someone who wrote
something a long time ago that you're just seeing but also me right now speaking these words to you
i didn't make up what these words mean this isn't my language i didn't decide it for you what you
are hearing through me is hundreds of thousands of years of dead people and the way the fact of their
death imbued these mouth sounds with meaning language in in its innermost essential form is a
communion with ghosts language is as as it is in the odyssey and as pound has it in the first canto that
is based on the odyssey it is bringing blood to ghosts so that the ghosts can then speak through you for a
moment again before they disappear there's there's no way around that and um whatever you know terrors
and and perils it has i don't think those are really extricable from the phenomenon of meaning
in general and so i think of it in terms of the the filamentary structure of a galaxy right that you have
a star and this star is of the correct profile because not all stars you know uh blow up some of them just go
dead over a long time but this is the kind of star that blows up that creates a nova that that
absolutely pulls itself to pieces and the gravitational shift created by the black hole that this star has
now become that pulls other things toward it and so other stars and of course the planets and
planetoids arrayed around those stars and their gravitational fields they are pulled toward this
black hole and so if if if you ever have the chance to look at the structure of a spiral galaxy
that's what it is it's a black hole with all these filaments all these arms of stars radiating out from it
because it took the radiation in a in a general sense it took the gravity of that core destruction
to bring these things into a comprehensible order and there's no way to get around that especially
in language you know this this is why hermes is responsible for uh messages for codes but also for uh
tricks and deceit and also for bringing the dead across the line and thought very much the same thing
that there's a i don't think it's actually an egyptian anecdote i think it's a greek philosopher who
was recording something allegedly uh allegedly spoken about in egypt but of of thoth showing the other
gods his invention of writing that he was going to give to human beings and the other gods going like
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa slow the fuck down with this are you really sure you want to give them this
are you really sure that the way for human beings to live is to have a way they can record what the dead
said and did and then look back on that at any time this system of signs that's going to be
continually modulating and and transmuting what they think of in terms of their own existence
by contrast by reference to the words of the dead that man i don't know about that idea
i think that is just it's it's baked in it's how this stuff works uh it's why this stuff works
and it is a continual uh danger for me i think for everyone but i think i because of the weird life
i've had i'm maybe more uh aware of it than i normally would be that the the black hole the fucking black
star at the core of all this doesn't eat me alive because once you've gotten close enough enough times
once you have been drawn into that feedback loop enough times you start to suspect that that black
hole that that empty dead core is in fact the meaning of everything that you mistake the um
the how should i say the anatomy of meaning the histology of meaning for being the core of meaning
and you risk jumping off all the fucking way right into the center of a word that then scars itself
shut behind you and i have seen a lot of people live and sometimes die that way and it's i wish i had
better advice for you about how to negotiate that but i think the the first step to having any kind of
livable relationship with that is by understanding how it works and for another cluster another
illustration of how it works what i was talking about last time i want to go to the latin root lex l-e-x
now lex some of you will recognize as being the word for law especially entire codes of law the
laws that were prominent in uh classical antiquity like the lex salica or the lex rodi
that were sort of general codices of laws to govern for example the behavior of ships at sea
what are you allowed to do what are you not allowed to do can you pull up into just any harbor you want
all the time do people ever have the right to get on your boat and split your shit if say it's the
middle of a war so this is the most common uh use of lex just in itself right but lex also provides
the roots for uh a number of other kindred words and ideas that you might not know were kindred
until you start looking into it lex law law giver right and i mentioned earlier and i'm going to talk
next time about how the the thunder or sky or lightning god seems to have been in many cases
abstracted into the god of an abstract law for various reasons some of them uh some of them just
i mean necessary in the historical sense there was nothing else people could do and some of them i think
actively pernicious and so the idea of the lex is married via the concept of law to this paternal
thunder god right well in uh in ancient greece and rome there was a folk belief that thunder and
lightning gave birth to acorns basically uh you know they were probably noticing acorns that were
fallen from trees after thunderstorms but the way they thought of it it was the thunder and the
lightning that made the acorns and if you were a poor farmer especially a pig farmer you knew hey day
after a big ass thunderstorm get yourself in the forest there's free food for all your pigs there
and so the the appearance of lightning the sound of thunder was to you know subsistence level people
in ancient greece and rome like a a phenomenal omen a great augury that holy shit god is taking care of me here
well the uh the latin for for acorn is elex i-l-e-x and lex as in law is part of elex
in the sense of to gather to bind because a law is what gathers a people together it's what makes a
people recognizable as a people right and we'll get into this next time but the more the more
geographically spread out a people is the more exiled and outcast and refugee a people is the
more important the idea of the law is because when you can't be in your place whatever place that is
and you can't see your gods the gods that are are sensorially real to you you are left with the idea
of law as a binding agent that keeps your people together as a people even if they are apart
individually so lex law elex acorn lex gathering the acorns legere to read
this comes also from this idea of binding of gathering when you read you gather letters
together and then understand them in words the same way the subsistence farmer in a fucking forest
on the italian peninsula you know 2100 years ago is gathering acorns to feed his swine so he doesn't
starve to death you are picking these individual things up that don't really mean much in themselves
but once you gather them together you see that they have a common harmonic a common overtone right
each one of them is a little blast of noise that is meaningless in isolation but you put all these
blasts of noise together and suddenly notice there's a coming from all of them there there is a shared
harmonic there and that shared harmonic is meaning that that's what meaning is it's it's the the mutual
overtone between its constituents of individual words or of sentences phrases paragraphs entire books
entire histories whatever that is how it works in in the most root sort of uh term when i say physical
terms i mean in terms of physics and so reading is not just some uh mundane unremarkable act when you read
you are out there on the forest floor except instead of gathering acorns for your animals you are picking up
signs you're picking up things that were once pictographs have now been combined into logographs and there's
another stage after that that i want to talk about next time in terms of the abstraction of godhead
you're picking up these signs picking up these glyphs in the fucking ozone aftershock of the sky god
coming down and touching the earth right in front of you and in the smell of that ozone you pick up these
glyphs and gather them together and suddenly they hit a common harmonic a common overtone and ring out
with meaning and that is not just how written language works that's what learning to read is it's gathering
it's picking up the acorns lex then from law has a direct connection to uh ligio to the the idea
ligature uh binding together in the sense of religion religio actually literally means
to gather a people back together to take a people who were scattered right and provide them with
something that reunifies them and this is a key point that i meant to make about um the homeric books
and about epics in general something that's fascinating to trace because even if people weren't
doing this on purpose they almost always ended up doing it so go all the way back to homer the
the the last i knew anyway the the the basic thought on um homer's life and work if homer was even one
person which is a whole other question is that homer lived sometime in the 700s bc and uh the events
homer is describing and cataloging the period of the trojan war that was something like 1200 bc now that in
itself is a phenomenal discovery and something we didn't know until right about the turn of the 20th
century we assumed the homeric epics were just totally made up that they were fantasy and that
the reason to read them was to see how good this guy was at making fantasies up and then sort of
modern archaeology began to rear its head and we realized oh holy shit troy is a real place
the site of troy which was you know compared to a modern city was tiny was basically one kind of
you know acropolis or citadel is a it is now a place in turkey called kisarlik and they excavated
kisarlik and they found that city after city had been built on this place i think there were either
seven or nine uh strata of destroyed cities under modern hisarlik and that one of them and one of
the older ones was totally reduced to carbon was basically a giant black streak of compacted ash
through the geological record because it had been burned down just like the troy in the iliad and so we
had for the first time not that long ago to reckon with the idea that oh this isn't just some bullshit
that that you know they thought was cool and thought reflected well on something about their society
no this refers to something that really happened and so homer is working i'm just going to keep saying
homer is there is all kinds of research you can do about what if even anyone homer was but just keep
it grammatically simple for the moment homer is working with materials that have already been
handed down for 400 500 years right everyone who was alive when the trojan war actually happened is dead
it's not like homer knows you know any of the veterans who can give him individual stories
and for both the iliad and the odyssey to me the most fascinating thing about them in this context
is that they were not something that one guy sat down and wrote from beginning to end
they were essentially each of the individual episodes in them were basically routines in in the sense of
a stand-up comic having routines they were the routine material for a class of basically traveling
sort of poet entertainers you can think of them as being like kind of halfway between like a comedian
and a folk singer would be now uh who were invited to perform often at the banquets of rich people
and would uh would respond to requests would would ask the crowd okay what do you want what are we doing
here and someone would go hey the fucking rage of achilles over here i want to hear that i like that he gets all
fucking mad and someone else would go i want to hear about the fucking time odyssey she washes up on the shore
and that dog wasn't there now secaia she's this big fucking prick of hell and the bard would tell these stories
and do it in a um very poetically condensed uh or i should say poetically structured way which is to say
there were definite links of lines there were definite syllabic emphases and this all went along
with music too so there were rules for it but within the rules and within the events of those stories
they were improvising they were making the shit up as they went along they knew okay i've got to get
this part in there and i've got to get this part in there and i tried to do you know part a this one
way the other night and people weren't really feeling it but then i did part b like this and everybody
fucking loved it so i'm gonna stick with that but i got to do part a different so what you have got
in homer is hundreds of years of improvised bardic performances compressed down into whatever homer
whatever entity homer was thought was the best version of each routine you have all this sort of uh
stray cultural matter all this detritus of everything you might kind of vaguely know about historically
if you lived anywhere from what's now you know say eastern turkey or western turkey pardon me to
eastern italy this stuff is just kind of floating around in your head and someone improvises a routine
getting the the major events in making it work as music and then homer condenses all of these
improvisations into what he considers you know the sleekest tightest punchiest best version
and then sets them as a book they were not necessarily related in a narrative or causal way
until they were made part of the book and one of the reasons for doing this one of the reasons that
uh homer became required reading uh in a number of cities in in greece during the sort of the peak of
classical greece you know the the four fourth and third century bc and so on is that the idea of greece
in itself the abstraction that like yeah you're from here and i'm from there but we're all from greece
that shit didn't really play the religion we talk now as if every greek alive in 400 bc had the same
religion no the fuck they did not there were local cults everywhere gods and goddesses had different
names all over the place because being real gods and goddesses they corresponded to the actual
experience and perceptions of the people who lived in these fucking places so of course they're not
going to take a god from athens and put it in boiotia or whatever that that doesn't ring for them
it doesn't fucking sing you know uh and so these things became required reading because they inculcated
the sense in greeks that yeah you're from you know thrace and he's from boiotia and uh you're from
this island and he's from that island but we're all the same people i know i know we don't like say
the same things or even necessarily talk the same but we're all one people and here are the basic
rudiments of our religion that we allegedly share and it is a fascinating thing to note to me that the
the dialect of greek that uh homer wrote in was not a dialect of greek that anyone actually spoke
it was something he she they whatever homer has all the pronouns uh something homer synthesized
out of trying to get the best versions of all of these stories homer had the writing has features from
like every extant dialect of greek from that time but there is no one person alive in greece in 708
or bc or whatever who would have spoken the language homer is writing and part of the reason that is
fascinating to me is that that is exactly exactly what dante did right around 2 000 years later
dante was taking all of these disparate places with their own fucking feuds and monarchical struggles
and successions and airships and trying to bind them into the notion of a catholic italy that while it
is catholic it is under the sway of god not of the pope because the pope is the son of a bitch fuck the pope
and in so doing he has to take all of these folk beliefs from all over the place because catholicism
i think one of the reasons it's still way more interesting than most other kinds of christianity
is that folk catholicism is all over the place especially back then but now still catholicism is
is only a sort of religious backbone from which various people build various religions over time
so he had to take every story and every special devotion and every notion of a particular god or
goddess he could find and whip them all in there right because i mean obviously the background of
classical antiquity is all through that he's not pretending none of that stuff happened the way
christians love to do and certain concepts the hierarchies of which are the worst sins for example
those come from dante those aren't the bible those aren't the pope that's not the seven deadly sins
that's dante that's not the bible that's not any work of scripture that is not fucking papal bull or
canon law he made that up out of what was there for him to work with and the particular fascination for
me and dante is that well one of them is that uh he he was living and writing in a time where
latin was the language of educated people basically everywhere in europe and he wrote plenty in latin he
wrote a political text called de monarchia he wrote i can't remember the name of his prose thing but that
was in latin um but he decided not to do that in uh in the comedy and he decided instead to try to
synthesize a language of his own that would combine the best most usable parts of latin with the best
most usable parts of all kinds of dialect italian particularly tuscan because he was tuscan you know
firenze is in toscano um god stupid side note but of all the cities and countries that have their names
translated into english i think florence is the one that just gets it the worst to go from firenze to
florence that fucking sucks anyway my point is dante effectively invented a language by hybridizing uh
correct you know ecclesiastical latin with italian dialect versions of it and by god people started
speaking dante's version of italian dante is almost precisely analogous to homer and in terms of italy
versus greece because in italy they still fucking call italian itself la lingua di dante dante's
language and that is literally true of one guy in a way you can hardly say about anything or anyone
anywhere and in that in that language in that hybridized you know pseudo latin pseudo tuscan dialect
he also had to synthesize all these folk beliefs around the basic structure of catholicism and give
them some kind of order and internal relationship exactly as homer did with the iliad and odyssey
and it is it is this sort of uh we might call this macro glyph right that you have the individual
glyphic structure of of small constituent parts that radiate and chemically react and add up to a much
larger meaning and then you have the macro glyphic structure of something like the iliad like the
odyssey like the divine comedy like the cansos like david jones's anathamera which i'm going to talk
about next time um that these manage to create gigantic glyphs that become the shared contextual
spine for entire civilizations and it is only by being able to think that way by being able to see
things as glyphed into elements of chemical reaction that you can really understand what is going on
both in general and in these specific histories and next time i'm going to talk about what happens
when people forget how to do that
so
