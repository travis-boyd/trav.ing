Hey everyone, this is our season finale, and we'll be going on a hiatus for the summer to figure out what is next for our show, and to take a break after a very intense season.
We're meeting with networks now in the hopes of finding a new home so we can keep doing what we do.
Please stay with us in the meantime. Stay subscribed to our show.
And if you want to keep up with us, you can become a patron or you can follow us on social media. There are links in our bio for both.
It also always helps so much if you leave us a review on Apple.
We thank you so deeply for the ways you support us, and we will be keeping in touch through this feed as much as we can.
Look out especially for our merch coming soon.
And please stick with us. We couldn't be luckier to have an audience like you.
Please be aware that this episode contains descriptions of racial violence.
On this season, we'll explore our most ingrained beliefs, delusions, and archetypes.
The ways that cognitive dissonance shapes our culture, and how our reality is created by the stories we tell.
I'm your host, Chelsea Weber-Smith, and this is American Hysteria.
At Forest Lawn, we understand how important it is to be right the first time.
Because when it comes to funerals, it'll be the only time.
Dr. Jesse Karmazin is talking about transfusions with the young blood from teenagers.
An embalmer and a funeral director were on the train full-time, constantly attempting to refresh the unrefrigerated corpse.
Sometimes it was myself in the coffin. It was my brothers in the coffin.
It was... I can't describe it precisely.
Really, how do I open an episode called Death?
I've struggled with this for a few weeks, and I can't seem to find the clean, personal story that could lead us into this final topic the way I've tried to throughout this season.
And maybe that's the best place to start. I don't know.
As much as these episodes have been about understanding our shared history, our shared psychology, and our shared modern culture,
I also set out to try to get to know myself in these contexts as much as I could.
But at the end of the day, of course, my own life and life in general remains a great and ever-expanding mystery.
Death is a universal fact.
Perhaps all that we can each be certain of.
Grief, too, is universal.
We will all lose people that will shatter us and will never be the same.
There are many kinds of death and many kinds of grief, and many different things can come from it.
When I lost my beloved grandpa two years ago, I was there when he died.
My whole family was.
It was a lucky kind of death, getting to say goodbye like that.
But nonetheless, it shattered me.
I'd never seen anything like that, been so close to that human truth.
I thought it would make more sense.
I thought, naively, it could be more like a poem than a fact.
He was my favorite person, and then he was gone, carried out by a young undertaker, turned into ash.
How do any of us make sense of that?
For our season finale, we are looking into the very heart of all our hysteria, all our fantastical thinking, all our archetypes, beliefs, delusions, our panic, the heart of all our stories, the ultimate cognitive dissonance.
And we were a little shocked with what we found.
Just how much this uniquely human knowledge of the inevitable future shapes not only who we are, but our politics, our prejudices, our entire culture at large.
We'll be taking a look at the historical progression of how Americans have dealt with death and the bodies it leaves behind.
We'll start with a strange modern example in Los Angeles, and then go all the way back to the Puritans to explore their idea of the good death.
Then we'll move into the massive death toll of the Civil War and the embalming methods that followed, including the long corpse tour of Abraham Lincoln.
In addition, we'll look at the history of the elite obsession with living forever, with immortality.
But we'll also explore how prior to the Civil Rights Movement and into this day, the deaths of white people and the deaths of black people have been treated completely differently in mainstream American culture.
In the middle of massive protests over the killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and other unarmed black people, America is again reckoning with death and what death has meant to the history of our nation.
Today, we'll ask the complicated questions.
How have we dealt with death since the very beginning of colonization?
And what does this universal fear of death make us do?
What is this place?
It's Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills, where you will find both undertaking and cemetery together at affordable prices.
And that may be the real beauty of Forest Lawn.
There is a sprawling cemetery outside of Los Angeles that has long been called the Disneyland of Death, or as the LA Times referred to it, a theme park necropolis.
The Forest Lawn Memorial Park is an enormous, saccharine-sweet playground of mortality, or rather, immortality.
An illustrious resting place for some of the most famous people in American pop cultural history, and anyone else who can afford it.
In 1917, a dreamer with a streak of capitalistic Christian mysticism named Hubert Eaton gained control of a small, run-down cemetery in Glendale, California, and decided that dying itself needed a cute new makeover.
He rechristened it a memorial park, believing that cemeteries were, quote,
Unsightly depressing stone yards.
And sought to make a new kind of mourning place, or rather a place
As unlike other cemeteries as sunshine is unlike darkness.
Hubert Eaton was not fond of tombstones, the way they would crack and slouch grayly over,
the words fading away over time.
In the new forest lawn, tombstones would be replaced by flat markers, far more impervious to the elements, and a little classier, too.
The grounds would become adorned with dramatic replicas of famous artworks, including a full-sized statue of Michelangelo's David,
and an enormous stained-glass rendering of The Last Supper.
He called these accents his silent salesman, and soon he would open a museum, curating some of the most famous art in existence.
He also added other attractions, such as the Pool of Reflection, as well as building several wedding chapels that were exact replicas of European churches,
and boasting big ceremonies there, including that of American hysteria favorite Ronald Reagan.
Elizabeth Taylor, Sammy Davis Jr., Michael Jackson, Clark Gable, Nat King Cole, the patron saint of my entire heart, Brittany Murphy,
Carrie Fisher, and the man himself, Walt Disney, are all buried at Forest Lawn.
To keep the grounds perfect, mourners are not allowed to leave balloons, ornamentation, statues, or stones,
and potted flowers must not exceed eight inches in diameter, with cut flowers removed within three days.
To give you a more visceral picture of this strange, deathless cemetery,
The very first statue installed in Forest Lawn was that of a naked toddler surrounded by ducklings, titled, fittingly, Duck Baby.
The vast 300 acres were divided in an eerily similar way to Disneyland.
There's babyland, made for infants and shaped like a big heart, slumberland for children and teenagers,
the garden of the mystery of life, sweet memories, inspiration slope, graceland, garden of honor, kindly light,
gardens of contemplation, and the dawn of tomorrow.
Eden also wanted to soften the language around death to make it more pleasant.
He created popular euphemisms that we still use today, calling a corpse the loved one,
and death itself leave-taking or passing on.
Even now, hearses are called casket coaches, graves are called internment spaces,
and dirt is referred to as earth.
Some accounts say you can even choose music to be eternally pumped into the crypts,
even when no visitors are present.
But Forest Lawn was more than an easier place to come to terms with mortality and to say goodbye.
It was also a very profitable business model.
Depending on the area, burial costs are currently going anywhere from $8,000 to $800,000.
Loudspeakers across the lawns break the calm music to remind visitors of the various on-site florists and gift shops.
When he was still around, Eaton required the staff to call him the Builder and reminded them every morning after a session of prayer that they were selling immortality.
The Builder's Creed is carved into a large stone tablet near the entrance.
It begins,
I believe in a happy eternal life.
Flanked by alabaster sculptures of children holding hands, and of course, a puppy curled beside them.
He paid an Italian artist to sculpt a Jesus statue with the explicit request that it have an American face,
and be
Filled with radiance, and looking upward with an inner light of joy.
But of course, for much of the beginning of its history, this cemetery did not allow any people of color to be buried in an all-white, suburban-esque, pastoral fantasy.
Beginning in the 1600s, most Puritan graves were adorned with a winged skull.
And yes, I know, this is extremely badass.
They were otherwise simple, austere, a rejection of the English-Catholic pomp and circumstance.
And they were common, too, because the colonists were no strangers to intimate death.
It was a basic and highly visible fact of their lives.
The death rate was incredibly high during their first century.
And even by the time the settlements were more established, one in ten children would die in their first year of life,
and up to 40% would not reach adulthood.
Most would die in their homes with their families, their bodies then washed and shrouded for a wake,
kept from decomposition with vinegar-soaked cloths and tubs of ice.
Facing death was twofold for the Puritans, something to be excited for at the potential of heaven and the confirmation of their goodness,
what was known as the assurance of salvation.
But since these are the Puritans we're talking about, after that sweet moment of assurance,
it was straight into something called necessary doubt, lest one be lulled by vanity, what they called false peace.
Throughout the following period, known as the Era of Enlightenment,
science slowly began to take its place alongside the religious superstitions of the past,
and bodies took on a new significance.
Doctors wanted to understand how the body worked in order to figure out how Americans could live longer,
how the dead could help the living.
But this was not always a noble pursuit in the eyes of those outside the medical field.
With the advent of public hospitals, medical students sought out the deceased to be used as experimental cadavers.
Medical students became well known for their nightly tradition of grave robbing,
which almost always meant exhuming the bodies of the enslaved,
which they did without much public notice or care.
But when this indignity extended to one white woman in New York City in 1788,
the locals went absolutely nuts.
It begins like this, or so the story goes.
A group of children were playing outside a hospital,
wherein a medical student was dissecting a human arm.
Annoyed by their chattering,
the student grabbed the arm,
hung out the window,
and in a perfect horror movie scene,
waved it at the children,
telling a specific boy that it was in fact the arm of his own mother,
who had died recently.
The kids took off in terror,
and the boy immediately told his father what the student had said.
When his father indeed found his wife's grave empty,
he gathered a group of townspeople who shared his outrage
and swapped stories about other gruesome and disrespectful experiments happening at the hospital,
and eventually 2,000 people would gather and riot,
breaking into the building and finding the macabre rumors to be true.
They pulled several students out by the arms and forced them into the crowd
until the mayor had them taken to jail,
and the rioters threw rocks at the militias called in for crowd control.
Up to 20 people would be killed,
and the laws would then be reformed about just who could be exhumed.
However, the petitions of the enslaved were largely ignored,
and the process of medical testing on exhumed black bodies in some states
lasted into the early 20th century.
I have been struck by a piece of shell,
and my right shoulder is horribly mangled.
I know death is near,
that I will die far from home and friends of my early youth.
I pray my God to forgive my sins,
and feel that his promises are true,
that he will forgive and save me.
The Civil War would be perhaps the greatest influence
on our modern dealings with the dead,
with the national shock of nearly 700,000 bodies,
as compared to less than 7,000 in the Revolutionary War.
Battlefields were covered with the dead,
and medics and soldiers were completely unable to keep up
with identifying and burying the bodies in an honorable way.
In just one day, during the Battle of Antietam,
for example, 23,000 men would perish,
their bodies lying out in the open for days.
During the Battle of Vicksburg,
the two sides called for a temporary truce
because of the stench of decomposing bodies.
They lacked important supplies, like carts and shovels,
and it's believed that in this particular battle,
the dead were almost completely unburied
after a week of working,
leading to a frustrated acceptance
of using masks in unidentified graves.
The soldiers of the Civil War wore no dog tags,
no identification,
and there was no database of those who were fighting,
and so families would sometimes
have to wander the battlefields themselves,
usually to no avail,
trying to find the bodies of their loved one,
hoping to fill what was called
the dread void of uncertainty.
At least half of those who died in the war
were never identified.
By the mid-1800s,
life expectancy was rising,
and so death was becoming more distant,
and those who survived into adulthood
were expected to live into middle age.
But the Civil War changed the psyche of Americans at large
and was often called the harvest of death.
Suddenly, this gathering around for final moments,
these whispered last words and goodbyes,
the comfort of a heavenly ascent
that marked their good death,
was no longer an option
for those who died on the battlefield
and their families.
Would they get to heaven or not?
What would become of their bodies?
And thus, what would become of their souls?
The trains that carried fallen soldiers home
in the scorching southern heat
required heavy iron coffins
to avoid the smell of decomposition,
which most families couldn't afford.
And so, scientists and doctors searched for a solution,
and they found it in the unorthodox practice
called embalming.
Undertaking, before the Civil War,
was largely a city affair,
focused on building and selling coffins,
renting out hearses and funeral carriages,
and selling mourning clothes and jewelry.
But as the need arose,
men took up embalming for cash
and followed skirmishes of the Confederate and Union armies,
embalming directly on the battlefield
and competing fiercely with one another,
often burning down each other's tents.
Propping up unclaimed bodies they had preserved
outside their facilities to mark their prowess,
these predecessors of ambulance chasers
also advertised their services with phrases like,
bodies embalmed by us never turn black.
A discount option from the $100 cost
was to eviscerate internal organs
and fill the body with sawdust,
despite this being considered a sin
by both the Protestant and Catholic traditions.
Beyond the soldiers themselves,
it would be the assassination of Abraham Lincoln
and his embalmed body's subsequent tour
that would bring this new post-mortem sensation
into popular consciousness.
People in the town would be singing hymns
and chanting prayers,
and as that faded away into the distance,
in the dark,
you could then hear the next town,
the next village of people doing the very same thing.
Millions would see and mourn the body of Lincoln
as the procession made the long trip
from Washington, D.C. to Springfield, Illinois,
with the former president preserved by a man
known as the father of American embalming,
Thomas Holmes.
People were amazed to see this man they so revered
one more time in person.
Well, sort of.
But the 20-day trip proved too much for the corpse,
and the New York Times reported that,
quote,
Dark as was the face before, and unearthly,
it was at 11 o'clock Monday night,
nearly five shades darker.
The dust had gathered upon the features,
the lower jaw somewhat dropped,
the lips slightly parted,
and the teeth visible.
It was not a pleasant sight.
Regardless,
so much of the country
had seen this man
that they so loved,
and it seemed that death
no longer belonged exclusively
to families and small communities.
It belonged to the people,
spread far and wide
through newspapers
and the new technology of photography,
with gruesome photographs
of battlefield corpses
only reinforcing the desire
to make the realities of death,
well,
less real.
But there was another history of death
occurring as white Americans
began to hide
the more gruesome aspects
of their own deaths,
a polar opposite reaction.
Most of us know
that thousands of black people
were lynched
from the post-slavery years
all the way through the 1960s
and even into the present day.
After the Civil War
gained black folks
their relative freedom
and a new list of rights
previously denied,
the lynching of black people
became far more widespread,
accounting for 73%
of the almost 5,000
post-Civil War lynchings,
despite only being
a fraction of the population.
And those white people
who were lynched
were quite frequently
abolitionists
who were working
with free men and women.
Just as it had been used
against fugitives
from slavery,
lynching was a horrifically
explicit warning
shrouded in punishment
for crimes not committed,
a way to continue
to enforce white supremacy.
Over the years,
the targets of violence
continued to be groups
seen by whites
as less than human.
The practice and ideology
of white supremacy
branded them
not only as less than human,
but degraded black
and red bodies
in order to exploit
them economically,
to oppress them politically,
and to dishonor
them culturally.
Sam Hose grew up
on a farm
in Macon County, Georgia,
coming of age
after the Civil War
and after his mom
had been freed
from enslavement.
He could read and write,
which was rare
for a black man
in the South,
and he was a man
who was remembered
by those who actually
knew him
as friendly
and intelligent,
a man who cared
for both his mother
and his brother
who was unable to work.
After moving
to a new county
to look for work,
he found a boss
in Alfred Cranford,
a man who was known
to withhold pay
from his workers.
When Cranston
was found dead,
a massive manhunt
began soon after
without any attempt
to gather evidence
or interview witnesses,
and Sam Hose
was the target.
quickly,
rumors became facts,
growing more and more
sensationalized
and lurid
each time they were told.
Suddenly,
Sam had not only
murdered the man,
but he had sexually
assaulted his white wife
and also threw
their infant son
against the wall,
or, by other accounts,
even sexually assaulted
the child.
After evading
the townspeople
and authorities
for a number of days,
Sam was captured
by a mob
on April 23, 1899.
As trainloads
of spectators
rushed to arrive
at the event,
some estimated
that as many
as 2,000
looked on,
as one journalist
wrote,
with unfeigned
satisfaction,
as parts of Sam's
body were sold
as souvenirs.
A pyre was built
beneath him,
and several from the mob
tossed matches
onto the kindling
as they all happily
watched him
burn to death.
The tree was cut down
and pieces were carried off,
links of the chains
given out to the crowd.
As was often the case
with lynchings,
both black writer
and activist
Ida B. Wells
and a white detective
found that Sam
had acted in self-defense
after Cranford
had placed a gun
to his head,
and that Sam
had never touched
either Mrs. Cranford
or her child,
who was found
in perfect health.
We can further see
this polar opposite
treatment of America's dead
through the advent
of photography.
Post-mortem photos,
known as
morning portraits,
showed the white deceased
dressed up nicely
and propped up
as they would have been
should they still be living.
This was often
the only image
that the family
would ever have to keep,
and so they made
multiple prints
and mailed them out
to loved ones
all over the nation.
At the same time,
though,
other photographs
were spread
as popular,
cheery postcards.
Photographs of black people
after they had been lynched
were mailed out
for friendly exchanges
with friends and relatives
and even swapped
like trading cards.
Roy Bryant
is the operator
of this small store.
It was here
that the Chicago Negro boy,
Emmett Till,
is alleged
to have paid
unwelcome attention
to Roy Bryant's
most attractive wife.
In 1955,
56 years after
the murder
of Sam Hose,
a 14-year-old black boy
named Emmett Till
had arrived down
from Chicago
to visit relatives
in a town called
Money, Mississippi,
a place where
just 10 days before,
Lamar Smith
had been shot dead
for political organizing
in a state
where 500 black people
had been lynched
in the past 60 years.
Just four days
before his murder,
Emmett and some friends
from town
had skipped church
and went to
Bryant's grocery store
and meat market.
There,
the boys bought candy
from store owner
Carolyn Bryant,
whose husband
was out of town
at the time.
When he returned,
she told him
that Emmett
had flirted with her
and harassed her.
Enraged
and armed
with a pistol,
Bryant and his
half-brother,
J.W. Millam,
pushed into the house
where Emmett
was staying
with his uncle
and found him sleeping.
They forced him
at gunpoint
into the woods,
beating
and mutilating him
before shooting him
in the head
and then sinking
his body
in the nearby river
where Emmett
would be found
three days later
by local kids fishing.
The lasting effects
of this brutal moment
in U.S. history
would come through
the actions
of Emmett's mother,
Mamie Till,
who made the choice
to have an open casket
for her son,
his face
so badly disfigured
as to be
unrecognizable.
Mamie asked
that the photo
be published
for the nation
to bear witness to
and it was printed
on the cover
of Jet magazine.
Over 50,000 people
would attend
Emmett's funeral
and that particular photo,
spread far and wide
in other newspapers,
has been noted
by many historians
as perhaps
the most important spark
to the coming
civil rights movement.
During the subsequent
jury selection,
both Black people
and women
were barred
from participating.
It took an all-white,
all-male jury
less than an hour
to come back
with a not-guilty verdict.
A jury member
was quoted as saying,
we wouldn't have taken
so long
if we hadn't stopped
to drink pop.
The men would later
admit their guilt
in a paid magazine article
under the protection
of double jeopardy.
But Mamie Till
was not through
with her work
and in partnership
with the NAACP,
she went on
a national tour
to talk about
her son's death
and raise money
for the organization
to work towards
civil rights.
It seemed to be
the first time
that a Black body
had been relatively
widely viewed
by white America
not as something
to celebrate
or explain away,
but as something
to deplore
and,
in the best of cases,
something to fight
actively against.
Here's Mamie Till
and James Baldwin.
I think it really
let us see
the ugly monster
that race hatred is.
It's almost
as if it was
embodied
in,
in,
uh,
his appearance
and his physical appearance.
In some sense,
it was myself
in the coffin.
It was
my brothers
in the coffin.
It was,
I can't describe it
precisely.
It was him,
but it was all of us.
Through the horrors
of World War II,
through the constant terror
of the nuclear threat,
America would design
an entire era
purified of death
when even the bomb shelters
were sold
as pretty little getaways,
sold with the newest
brands of food
to every fashionable
housewife
in bright green suburbia.
The more liberal decades
to follow,
though,
would usher in new ideas
about how to deal
with life after death
as well as how to avoid
the increasingly expensive
funeral industry
with new options
like cremation.
But still,
like Forest Lawn,
in classic American style,
it can cost a lot
to die,
and it can cost a lot
to try to live forever.
There are more and more
tech billionaires
investing in various
bizarre sciences
to attempt to live
as long as possible,
perhaps forever,
like Google's co-founder,
Sergi Brin,
co-founder of Oracle,
Larry Ellison,
and Amazon's own
Jeff Bezos,
to name a few.
Some are working toward
the preservation
of consciousness,
our minds uploaded
into the cloud,
living as a digital being
into perpetuity.
Some organizations
began housing
several coffin-sized
crypto-preservation canisters
kept at 320 degrees
below zero
for the purpose
of preserving
the bodies of the dead
until scientific advancements
make it possible
to revive them.
Others are working
to design tiny robots
called nanobots
that will monitor
and regulate
circulatory processes,
while others operate
as little baby
trash compactors
to replace
intestinal functions.
Google's director
of engineering
believes that by 2045,
immortality will be
fully achieved.
Dr. Jesse Karmazin
is talking about transfusions
with the young blood
from teenagers,
and he says it just
may turn back
the hands of time.
In the most haunting
of examples,
billionaire tech investor
and friend to Donald Trump,
Peter Thiel,
is helping fund
three U.S. companies
that are currently working
to transfuse
the blood of the young,
mostly ages 16 to 24,
into their own veins
like a vampiric fountain
of youth.
And there are rumors
that some have already
started this process.
But this dream
of immortality
by the elite
is nothing new.
In another example,
we can look back
to the 1930s,
in an age
where the pseudoscience
of eugenics
and social Darwinism
created a new basis
for the superiority
of whites
over all other races
and indeed
poor whites as well.
The elite were attempting
to cement the riches
and the power
that they apparently
inherited through their blood.
American inventor
and aviator
Charles Lindbergh
believed that the body
worked like a machine,
and he and Nobel Prize-winning
Dr. Alexis Carroll
worked together
to design a profusion pump
to keep organs alive
after being removed,
believing that they could create
the science needed
to make humans immortal.
In 1935,
the pump sustained
a cat's thyroid gland
for 18 days,
and the New York American
ran the headline,
quote,
one step nearer
to immortality.
But this immortality
had another purpose.
Lindbergh was outraged
at what he believed
to be the decline
of Western civilization
caused by white people
mixing with inferior races
who held weak
and deviant genes,
and his hope
for immortality
was largely based
in the hope
to create this immortality
for a group
of elite whites
so that they could rule
into perpetuity
over lesser beings.
This hope for human immortality
was directly related
to the hope
for the immortality
of rich white dominion.
So now that we have
some background
on the different ways
that Americans
have dealt with death,
let's try to figure out
why.
In the early 1980s,
three professors
of social psychology
used a Pulitzer Prize-winning book
called The Denial of Death
by Ernest Becker
for a new area
of research
that they called
the Terror Management Theory.
Sheldon Solomon,
Jeff Greenberg,
and Tim Pishkineski,
whose now well-respected ideas
were initially rejected
and ridiculed
by other academics,
would spend 30 years
conducting more than
500 studies
seeking to prove
that, quote,
unconscious efforts
to deny and transcend death
are behind much
of human activity.
Now, this theory
is very complicated,
so we encourage you
to explore more of it
on your own,
but here is our best attempt
to make sense
of the parts
that apply today.
The theory posits
that there are
two major things
this subconscious fear
of death makes us do.
To seek out a sense
of self-worth
or esteem
and to reinforce
cultural values
and norms.
Mainstream culture
and indeed humans
in general
don't want to face
death head-on,
but the knowledge
is always there
in the back of our minds,
and this seems to be
where many of our problems
become worse.
Some examples include
children gently questioned
about the concept of death
were less likely
to befriend immigrants.
White college students
showed a preference
for a black study participant
to neatly fit
their cultural stereotypes
of black men
after being reminded
of their own deaths,
and adults favored
an unwaveringly
self-confident
charismatic leader
over candidates
who emphasized
community building
or clear methods
of change
when they were
reminded of death.
In one study,
the researchers
asked two groups
of judges
to set bail
for a sex worker
in a hypothetical case.
Both groups were asked
to fill out
a short survey,
and one had a few questions
regarding their feelings
about their own mortality.
The group that was asked
general questions
without reminders of death
set bail at $50,
the standard
for the case presented,
but the group
that was reminded of death
set bail at an average
of nine times that amount,
revealing a human habit
of punishing transgressors
of our social norms
to a greater extent
when we're presented
with thoughts
of our own mortality.
Research also repeatedly
showed that Americans
reminded of death
reacted more positively
to those who praise
the United States
and more negatively
to those who criticize it,
even going so far
as to be willing
to cause intentional pain
to those who they perceive
to threaten cultural norms.
In one study,
which I consider
to be the most unnerving
and also the most important,
researchers found
that reading about the deaths
of perceived evildoers
actually reduced
a subject's own thoughts
of their own mortality.
This provides
the two coping mechanisms
of the terror management theory.
The self-esteem
needed to believe
that we are better
than our outgroup,
our perceived evildoers,
and then the confidence
we gain through reinforcing
our own culture,
a culture that lives on
well after we do
and thus can help us
feel immortal.
Every culture
has its outgroups.
In America,
our outgroup,
our perceived evildoers,
among so many other
marginalized populations,
have often been
black people
who are not only
considered lesser than,
considered of
a lower order,
which, by the way,
reinforces the self-esteem
of white people,
but have also historically
and currently
been accused
of false crimes
in order to render
them villains,
to make whatever punishment
they incur
into a necessity
to protect
American cultural norms.
If the terror management theory
is indeed sound,
then it seems possible
that when we punish
our outgroups,
we feel less afraid
of our own deaths,
lulled into,
as the Puritans put it,
a false peace.
In 1963,
James Baldwin
captured the problems
with our subconscious,
repressed fear of death
in The Fire Next Time,
as read by actor
Jesse L. Martin.
Life is tragic
simply because
the earth turns
and the sun
inexorably rises
and sets.
And one day,
for each of us,
the sun will go down
for the last,
last time.
Perhaps the whole root
of our trouble,
the human trouble,
is that we will sacrifice
all the beauty
of our lives,
we'll imprison ourselves
and totems,
taboos,
crosses,
blood sacrifices,
steeples,
mosques,
races,
armies,
flags,
nations,
in order to deny
the fact of death,
which is the only fact
we have.
It seems to me
that one ought to rejoice
in the fact of death,
ought to decide,
indeed,
to earn one's death
by confronting
with passion
the conundrum
of life.
One is responsible
to life.
It is the small beacon
in that terrifying
darkness
from which we come
and to which
we shall return.
In this spring
of 2020,
America is again
dealing with
a reckoning
of death,
not only those
of the present,
but also those
of the past,
the death
of white America's
historical
others.
Less than five
hours away
from where Sam
Hose was lynched,
Ahmaud Arbery
was falsely accused
by two white men
of robbery
and killed
while he was jogging
by shotgun
after being pursued
by the father
and son vigilantes.
Millions of Americans
saw this video,
again saw the death
of another innocent
black person
killed by white people
making false accusations.
And then came
George Floyd,
also seen dying
on camera,
uploaded for the
entire nation,
the entire world,
to see in a monumental
video whose lasting
effect may not be
unlike that photograph
of Emmett Till
65 years ago.
George Floyd
has become enormously
more than himself
and his death
has changed America's
future irrevocably.
But the funerals,
the homegoings
of black people
have so often
carried the burden
of the political.
It was at funerals
where the enslaved
were able to meet
in private,
so that's where
they organized
revolts and other
work toward freedom.
Maybe one day,
mainstream America
won't need death
to spark
these vital movements
to shock us
into the truth.
I was with
my beloved
grandpa
at the very
end of his life,
a man who made me
want to understand
the world enough
to stay in love
with it,
to be as kind
and unafraid
as he was.
He was so
unconcerned with dying
that he once
casually told me,
just burn me up
and put me
in the roses.
When that time
actually came,
I saw death.
I really saw it.
For the very first time,
I said goodbye
to a person
who had loved me,
who I had loved,
my entire life.
I was lucky enough
to put old pictures
of our family
in his pockets,
to touch
his wonderful face,
to say goodbye
before the young
undertaker
carried him away.
Before his death,
I had started
growing a rose
because he grew roses
and I wanted
to be like him.
And two,
I wanted to make
beautiful things
lined with sharp moments
that sometimes hurt.
That first year,
I had not learned
the proper care
for a rose
and I thought
that I'd killed it
over the winter
without caring
for it enough.
My grandpa died
a month later
and I sprinkled
his ashes
over the dark soil,
dreaming,
you know,
that its heavy flowers
would come back again.
They did come back
and I wanted
so badly
for that to mean
something
that somehow
the harsh truth
of beauty
wants to reach us
to tell us something.
But what?
Poet Frank Stanford
said,
all of this
is magic
against death.
At the close
of this season,
we are in the middle
of an uprising
unlike anything
the nation
has seen
since the civil rights
movement.
One is responsible
for life,
James Baldwin wrote,
urging us all
to earn our death
by confronting
with passion
the conundrum
of life.
to confront
the conundrum
of American life
before it becomes
the conundrum
of death.
The deeply
personal losses
that sparked
this new movement,
this grief,
don't belong to me.
But what does belong
to me,
to each of us,
is the responsibility
to decide
what will come
from them.
America once believed
in the good death,
that the way
a person died
signified both
how they have lived
and where they were going.
Perhaps now,
400 years later,
these deaths
instead show
how we have lived,
how America
has lived
for these long
and grief-soaked
centuries.
What remains
to be seen,
what we cannot
yet know
with any
assurance
of salvation,
what we cannot
face
with false
peace,
is what will
happen,
is where
we are going
next.
