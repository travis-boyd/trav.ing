8.92 82.66 SPEAKER_03  a cool interview out with this uh Hassan which I have not yeah it's okay I mean like I it was fun to write it I mean he kind of like did me a favor by letting me do it but I had it I had well maybe I don't know if I should talk about this or I don't know what you guys want to talk about but I I had a interesting phone conversation yesterday and today with a one Jimmy Donaldson wait that's that's Mr. Beast yes he contacted you because you kept calling him a like demonic no actually it's kind of it's actually pretty crazy like it's genuinely fucking insane because I've said this to people before and they like didn't believe me that I'm like you don't understand he keeps eyes on his ops like he actually keeps eyes on his ops if you cause problems for him he will follow you like he followed me on twitter a year ago when I did the demonic tweet yeah and he I'm not kidding the thing is like he's kind of the way that he talks is he's sort of like hey uh yeah it's me Jimmy like like like I think he wanted me to be like more excited that I was
82.66 88.96 SPEAKER_04  talking to Mr. Beast and I was like hey Jimmy what's up why why did what did he want from you
88.96 250.04 SPEAKER_03  to be like hey his newest video this is actually fucking crazy he wanted me to watch his newest video and give him like feedback he's like I'm trying to get data points on this like I want to know if people like it or not and yeah the leg the leg one the I give 2,000 people legs because I am god legs are coming soon he invented legs and I said yeah sure I'll give it a watch and then I I messaged him after that and I was kind of like you know what would be cool I have a sub stack maybe I could follow you around for a couple days and I could write about it and I literally said I think what I said was no press is bad press you know no press is bad press Jimmy and he's like well I want to talk I want to let's get to know each other is what he said and he asked for my phone number and literally like five minutes later I get a call from North Carolina that's fucking Jimmy and I'm like okay cool we talked for like 20 minutes and uh I'm like I don't know how he has time to fucking call my dumb ass yeah could you have an empire to run man it's like what are you doing dude and so anyway I watch I watched his video today and I gave him like notes I was like here are some notes on the video and then uh he called back this is the craziest thing genuinely the craziest thing the craziest fucking thing is I gave him the notes which were kind of like you know it was like light feedback it was sort of like I think you could be bolder like if you're going to criticize these things you should be more explicit like you don't have to like be explicit you know don't don't say it in the last 30 seconds of the video and tack it out at the end like yeah you know put it more out there like and I and I even said to him like I understand you probably feel like you're kind of in a pressure cooker because a shitload of people watch your stuff but like everybody hates for-profit health care like you're not going to lose any fans by saying fuck that shit but um so anyway he starts he calls me immediately and I'm like I sent you all my notes he's like well I want to know what you thought I'm like okay yeah like I watched he's like well did you like it and I was like yeah sure Jimmy like it was and then this is the fucking craziest thing that he says he goes was there any point in the video where you got bored oh he is so content brained this is crazy that's real content and I literally said to him the thing is it snapped me out of reality where I literally said you're fucking insane I said that I was like I was like bro you're fucking crazy and he's like what do you mean I'm like
250.04 260.88 SPEAKER_01  you're why you're calling one guy like you're calling me and you're like what did you get bored during the video it's like dude what this isn't like a
260.88 273.80 SPEAKER_00  this is not a test sample like what you're you're you're his uh test group yeah he sat you down he's like okay here's here's my slot what'd you think of the slot crazy crazy crazy move
273.80 301.10 SPEAKER_03  I fucking love that that guy's on the grind all times it's crazy it's next level I mean that's next level honestly he's okay well I want to talk to my haters well the funniest thing was yesterday when he called so I've had two conversations with him on the phone yesterday when he called he said well you know he was like nonchalant about it but he was like well you know like I know some people are critical of me like I think maybe you called me the devil like seven
301.10 314.20 SPEAKER_02  days ago and like I literally did I said this dude no one could convince me this guy is not the devil is what I said and he said that I'm like yeah sorry about that Jimmy
314.20 386.82 SPEAKER_00  yeah sorry about that Jimmy but no that's incredible I had experience with that too I didn't like do too much with it because there was that period like over a year ago where I was antagonizing him pretty heavily too I made the post about like his chocolate bar like the like his like slaves or whatever and then I posted the fake screenshot of like the Mr. Beast uh what did I call them the the mini beast uh store like movers where they would like shelve like properly organize the chocolate bars at like Walmart and I criticized him for like seemingly lying about the like the submarine the titan incident where he was like he was like I could have been on there and he posted like a screenshot and it was like from the wrong perspective I was like why are you replying to something you said you got a text from so after a while he just like he followed me he did the same thing he followed me on my old account um before I got suspended my original one and um he he would he started dming me he was like hey what's your like what's what's going on here what's the deal can you we talked we like low-key like we never talked on the phone but we like talked back and forth in the the dms for like two days it was really fucking weird he you're right he is on top of his
386.82 390.72 SPEAKER_05  ops he has a we should try and get him on the show but he'd probably have us killed at this point
390.72 428.78 SPEAKER_03  well seriously I mean you know look I'm super down to shadow him and write about it because I think it would be super interesting and cool like he you know and I don't know if he was serious or not but he did like yesterday when we talked he was like dangling the possibility of me going to Africa with him oh what so I do want to say Jimmy Jimmy if you're listening somewhere I will come with you to Africa but also I was like what if he kills me in Africa what what if he what if he just
428.78 436.90 SPEAKER_00  I split this one person into 1,000 pieces he's just like Alex go talk to that tribe and it's like

586.46 596.94 SPEAKER_05  shit I think he'd be into that oh he would and uh very special guest for this episode uh Alex2 aka Lolo how you doing pal I'm great
596.94 605.94 SPEAKER_03  I'm coming to you live from Langley coming to you live from Langley Virginia
605.94 639.46 SPEAKER_05  we got our own ops inside of us now hell yeah hell yeah okay uh you guys know what this is we've been doing this for fuck two years or something two years goddamn our longest running like little series that we do yeah uh it's the worst tweets of the end of 2024 and I say this every time we do one of these that it and it's true because the world is just getting shittier and worse like this this reflects that certainly there is some genuine heat in this episode the collective minds of
639.46 648.72 SPEAKER_00  humanity is just getting worse and it's reflecting in all the posts that we have to scroll through every day and I I personally love how insane everyone is yeah um it makes me laugh a lot
648.72 664.60 SPEAKER_05  okay let's uh let's uh just hop right into it here we got we're not going to do a ton of of runners up because uh Lolo we've got you for for both parts of this and I want to respect all your time usually we do a bunch of these but we've just got one page of runners up and it's really just
664.60 674.54 SPEAKER_03  I'm a very busy I'm a very busy I'm a very rich very rich life with a large family
674.54 686.94 SPEAKER_00  what's that wait hold on my wife's phone yeah okay you gotta take care of your fucking kids so beautiful
686.94 715.08 SPEAKER_05  sorry um no that's amazing let's see we got two here uh we don't I put like about I put about what is this like seven eight tweets from this one in the slideshow um but we only really need the whole story yeah we only really need to read the first one I just wanted to put it in there because uh this is about half of the thread but just read the first one June if you want to read the
715.08 752.52 SPEAKER_00  first one I'll read this yeah I'll read the first one and then I see all the way at the end there's a cybersmith oh is that a different one the cybersmith reply that's a different one okay okay I'll read the first one here one reason I don't get married and have a family this is calling out uh Alex directly here because you have a wife and many kids yeah most depressed family have yeah it's it's probably the worst you could be um okay one reason I don't get married and have a family is because I know there will be endless pressure for my so-called wife to get a real job she won't genuinely support my entrepreneurship dreams because let's face it she has her own stupid dreams that she wants me to fund
752.52 784.98 SPEAKER_05  I love this this is like my stupid bitch wife uh tweet when you're not even married that is the guy um he's making up a bitch wife to get mad at yeah this is like a 15 uh a 15 tweet thread about his his figurative bitch wife and why he'll never get married uh we don't need to read them all because it's not it's like you you've got what you need to out of it but again I wanted to put that in there for effect um didn't quite make the cut but I laughed so hard when I saw this I was like
784.98 795.58 SPEAKER_00  yeah this guy's gotta this guy's gotta no I think I think that actually is the first time I've seen someone make up a fake wife yeah like that I mean I haven't seen people make up fake wives uh like
795.58 799.12 SPEAKER_04  that usually it's like for clout they're like yeah I'm married and have kids of course I'm not
799.12 805.00 SPEAKER_05  yeah I'm not like what the fake's hypothetical I don't think anybody would do that nice twist
805.00 810.76 SPEAKER_04  yeah I'm certainly not a fellow alex they have too much integrity uh
810.76 818.16 SPEAKER_05  I mean I kind of I kind of agree like I I I see I see it that's the same reason I'm not married
818.16 841.76 SPEAKER_03  that's why I put this in here because I like I like this tweet in the thread I just don't understand the whole point of it especially when I don't have a strong desire to have children to begin with I genuinely believe it's just societal programming men want to have sex men don't want to take care of children and luckily for me I figured out sex you believe me I do hell yeah oh my god
841.76 846.38 SPEAKER_05  by the way I'm definitely that's a really good I need everybody to know that I'm having sex
846.38 853.98 SPEAKER_04  just so you all know y'all I'm happy okay I don't really I don't really know what sex is but I hope
853.98 874.68 SPEAKER_00  that I get to do it one day I'm gonna just read the last part of that too because I feel like it okay well it's a little cut off but I just like like you can just imagine where it keeps going yeah a little bit of imagination involved here yeah you can't lead a marriage family anymore like the old days men have been thoroughly neutered through and then it comes off there but it's you know
874.68 880.66 SPEAKER_03  what could it have been it could be where's the neutered stuff coming on from because zuckerberg just
880.66 898.56 SPEAKER_00  said that on rogan oh is he talking about how like women have like neutered like workplaces is that part of it yes I don't know it seems like I don't know these like weird pseudo right-wing and you know actually right-wing fascist people like all collectively learn a word at the same time I've noticed and
898.56 920.86 SPEAKER_05  I'll use it like right before you got in I was like longhouse theory took place towards the end of the election that was an interesting one what was the what what was it longhouse theory if you don't know what that is basically it's like a an indigenous people's like in a long house where they live collectively and like the women are essentially caretakers and the men are instructed what to do
920.86 926.24 SPEAKER_00  inside of the house or something it's like a patriarchal society or something I think my favorite thing
926.24 932.58 SPEAKER_03  that tick-tock developed is that people just make things up and they call it theory like it's something existed before
932.58 951.16 SPEAKER_00  no there there's there's so many thinkers these days everyone's a philosopher these days I think that's what's beautiful about being online is that everyone's a philosopher yeah uh okay so the next one
951.16 1015.42 SPEAKER_05  I'll read it it is something that I it's not in this bracket because it has anything to do with me so just stay just just bear with me for a second but friend of the show yorch torch games which uh some of you may know through uh the fact that he and I are now best friends he's the guy who says gamers with a comma and then says some insane stuff so I posted gamers can women be witchers and we're talking about the controversy around siri being a witcher in the upcoming witcher 4 game blah blah blah uh making fun of yorch torch and that's whatever not really that good of a tweet frankly I've been doing that bit for months now um we got a reply from friend of the show cybersmith and he completely ignored everything that I was saying and said for years you left-wingers have talked about quote class consciousness and quote well gamers are a class are they not they've become conscious they are collectively bargaining for their interests they have no you have no honesty if you complain about this they're doing precisely what you argued for
1015.42 1067.68 SPEAKER_00  I think I think the amazing thing about the whole gamers thing like I think we have to face the facts at least temporarily gamer gate has truly won like complete cultural gamer gate victory I I think sadly it's sad to admit it I think earlier this year when we were observing like gamer gate 1.5 there was like the oh this is like not really going anywhere but like the thing with like the cybersmith is like you say what you will about him he's usually on the cusp of of like modern day thinking like the it feels true theory of change that he has where yeah facts don't really matter it's just whatever feels true is true to society therefore that is more important what actually is true and he's right like gamers have collectively like woken up they are they are a class they they are a class of voters the gaming voter block is real at this point yeah it's kind of a canary in the coal
1067.68 1095.16 SPEAKER_04  mine isn't he yeah uh brief aside I watched the movie mortal engines this weekend which is like a big blockbuster that didn't do very well it's based on like some young adult books nothing of note in this movie totally bog standard like blockbuster except like the mayor of the town in this like steampunk post-apocalyptic future looked exactly like the cybersmith hell yeah hell yeah dude I love
1095.16 1099.68 SPEAKER_00  his fit that one iconic image of the cybersmith goes so hard whatever else you want to say about
1099.68 1105.24 SPEAKER_05  him like he looks cool and I'm sorry who if anybody's upset by that he genuinely looks cool to me I don't
1105.24 1113.62 SPEAKER_03  you're hearing from lots of people about that one what I really want to hear specifically is the
1113.62 1120.50 SPEAKER_00  menswear guy uh critique on his fit oh my god the menswear guy thread on cybersmith's uh getup
1120.50 1142.82 SPEAKER_05  I need we have the power to make that happen guys we could I think we should yeah okay uh let's get okay so these are the runners up we can move on uh let's go to the first one slide number three here uh let's see uh lolo do you want to read the first one and then I'll read the the second one sure
1142.82 1178.22 SPEAKER_03  this is stumbled upon r slash frugal I thought it would be cool tips and tricks for saving money but it's actually just a form mental illness and the image is I don't blame anyone for not using their blinker you only get so many blinks per bulb and depending on the novel they're not cheap to replace either obviously yes they are yeah they're extremely cheap they're so cheap what are you talking about obviously don't do this during traffic because you'll fall off but I don't use mine when I'm alone on the road I'm sure I've extended his
1178.22 1185.80 SPEAKER_08  lifespan by a couple of months at least do you want to help do this oh my fucking god
1185.80 1221.34 SPEAKER_05  I can't get past blinks per bulb that's like just for for context I did a little bit of research into this because I was just curious um the the through line is if you're replacing your bulbs your blinker bulbs enough to where it's bothering you something else is going on because those things are rated for four fucking thousand hours on average I don't think I've ever changed I've ever changed a blinker bulb I've done it a bunch of times but because I grew up broke and had shitty car old shitty cars but like it takes fucking 10 minutes and it costs like 15 dollars like it's
1221.34 1224.52 SPEAKER_03  maybe this guy's taking a lot of turns that you don't know about
1224.52 1231.46 SPEAKER_05  this guy if this guy's listening he's like you fat cat 15 dollars huh you expect us to grow it up
1231.46 1261.44 SPEAKER_00  you might be on to something oh my god no I I that that seems like a gold mine of content like that that place I I need to go go into our slash frugal our slash frugal is definitely a fun one but like I will say I I will defend him on when he's on the road alone I don't you know I don't use my blinker yeah because fuck that yeah like if you're on the freeway and it's just you and you're like turning off the freeway or something what's that for what do you mean what's that the king of the highway
1261.44 1293.70 SPEAKER_05  tweet god I love that king of the highway king of the highway uh okay so this next one I'll read uh this is from choppa and it's a picture of a little baggie full of a white substance supposedly ketamine and it's like a sugar to me yeah he says ket and then there's a reply this is a twitter group from sick come and the mod who's a moderator and says this is a crack only group if you want to post your little goo goo gaga bullshit bushwick drugs go to reddit
1293.70 1311.30 SPEAKER_00  uh he he kind of was right about the bushwick drugs part that you know the one time I was in bushwick yeah no the one time I was in bushwick people carry that on them like it's nothing like like
1311.30 1317.04 SPEAKER_03  it's a water bottle it makes special snorting devices specifically for ketamine
1317.04 1338.44 SPEAKER_00  it is it is baby goo goo gaga land out there damn oh my god I love the idea that like I don't know any groups like I I've always found like drug forums or drug groups to be like the funniest groups online ever like the heroin um reddit r slash heroin is r slash heroin is
1338.44 1358.18 SPEAKER_03  I love I love the meth one the meth one is so good or like have you ever seen the meth tiktoks where people are like just do a little bit of ice so I can like get the take the edge off and feel myself be the life of the party like yeah uh it's it's such good content oh my god fortunately or perhaps
1358.18 1377.16 SPEAKER_05  unfortunately depending on on how you're viewing this uh meth will be making an appearance later in this bracket shout out to meth shout out to meth friend of the show meth um okay so which one which who who do we got here do we got bushwick goo goo gaga or do we've got the uh the blinker the blinker
1377.16 1391.36 SPEAKER_00  money saver oh god these are both good they're yeah they're they're both kind of heater tweets is the problem uh shit this is hard actually this one's really hard I I you know I'm gonna have to go with
1391.36 1397.88 SPEAKER_04  like the cat one that's what I yeah because because calling it goo goo gaga bullshit is that's really
1397.88 1415.72 SPEAKER_00  like it's beyond reproach honestly just like a good insult like that's so funny like yeah to be like we do crack here actually yeah crack only not your baby bullshit uh lolo any any uh any do you want to
1415.72 1426.94 SPEAKER_03  speak on behalf of the the blinker nation I do like the blinker one I think it's silly but I think it's I think in terms of tweet content yeah I like the ketamine one better okay

1956.60 1967.80 SPEAKER_04  i love deleting this like no he ended up he ended up doubling the fuck down yeah he went in on this
1967.80 1973.52 SPEAKER_00  hard he dug in he tweeted about this referencing this like a couple of days ago again he's like
1973.52 1979.26 SPEAKER_02  still he's really trying to fuck these boys yeah well his whole thing was like his whole thing was
1979.26 2001.52 SPEAKER_04  like i know what i meant and you know what he was like i know what he was like i use that word deliberately to be provocative i mean he obviously used it because he's fucking dumb but he was like he was like you'll never they no one can believe that i used such a provocative word to describe what i was trying to say i i will he really just does not know what that word means like the two
2001.52 2053.02 SPEAKER_00  things that were going through my head when i witnessed this because this was like right before the election like a day or two before the election it was it was like right on the cusp and when i saw this first of all i was like why is he saying this like this is like i don't know just fucking bizarre kind of weird like why is he just saying like he would be gay if we were in a better world or something like that like that's kind of an insane thing to be like like as a conservative like yeah things were better you would be my little gay little boys like that's kind of wild but like the other thing is it's like i i did think kamala was gonna win but like of course but this was one of the things that like put a crack in that that theory because it's like this tweet i don't know this this tweet could not have been made in a world where kamala was gonna win right yeah like this this is a trump world tweet and it popped off it like i just couldn't believe what i was reading and it
2053.02 2075.04 SPEAKER_05  should have been the first time this is an inflection point dude this was an inflection point it was like oh fuck we're we're we're out like trump's gonna win um okay we should have known uh this next tweet if you can believe it or not makes me want to kill myself even more and it's from a friend of the show elon musk and it is a picture of elon musk uh with this real as iron man
2075.04 2079.56 SPEAKER_03  this is real it's yeah this is real though this actually is not you're not fucking around he
2079.56 2115.96 SPEAKER_05  actually tweeted this he actually seriously he actually tweeted this uh and he's done this same bit more how does he not kill himself every day dude i want to kill myself just through vicarious shame like i i don't know how he does this but okay so the picture is him and the tony stark iron man suit with the words irony man and the post is i will use the power of irony to defeat villains exclamation point oh you call yourself the joker then you can't tell a joke how ironic and it has
2115.96 2169.06 SPEAKER_00  225 fucking thousand likes i i don't know i i this dude does not understand like not that it necessarily matters but whenever he posts about like movies or anything like that that one he quote tweeted that godfather uh like edit where it's like the doge father and he quote tweets it with cue the music from the movie it's like what are you talking about what do you mean he like every like pop cultural reference he makes like that that evangelion one where someone is like please tell me you watch evangelion elon and he just says nerf like i just can't stand this guy oh my god how ironic kill yourself dog come on that would have popped off in 2007 for sure it would have been making the rounds on reddit absolutely just looking
2169.06 2179.56 SPEAKER_05  at it makes me upset i'm gonna be honest i can't stand looking at this we gotta vote i can't continue to look at this image uh i mean again we're in like a you're in like a pedophile
2179.56 2195.84 SPEAKER_04  there's we're in a no win situation they're both so fucking awful that's exactly right yeah i mean i uh seal team six pedophile or irony man
2195.84 2199.42 SPEAKER_05  wait it's a trick they're both pedophiles
2199.42 2219.64 SPEAKER_00  we got it with the best pedophile must win who's the best pedophile here you know i gotta say like the elon musk one is bad like it's it's a tweet that makes me laugh and hate myself at the same time but there's just something about the robert j o'neill one
2219.64 2224.70 SPEAKER_05  that's the fucking guy who killed bin laddie yeah and he's like yeah by the way i'm a pedophile
2224.70 2229.14 SPEAKER_00  if you vote for kama i will rape you i'm not just a pedophile i'm a gay pedophile
2229.14 2251.52 SPEAKER_05  like what are you talking about dog but also the the problem with elon that he makes it almost every time we do one of these we run into the same thing with like jordan peterson who's also never won you're just so consistently bad all the time it's like not shocking like god it just makes me makes me angry and like sick feeling to see anything that he posts they just have a high volume of
2251.52 2272.04 SPEAKER_00  insane or bad tweets yeah they're just super consistent at it but sometimes the non-consistent shooters like this guy are just like so shocking that's why i gotta go with my boy um six-year-old lover yeah yeah robert j o'neill sweet that's why i have to go with my boy the gay pedophile
2272.04 2287.64 SPEAKER_04  jesus christ what am i doing right now this is the worst episode we can barely get through this because we're all losing our fucking mind right now uh okay yeah let's go let's go with the gay
2287.64 2293.48 SPEAKER_03  yeah let's go with the gay pedophile gay pedophile yay
2293.48 2306.52 SPEAKER_05  okay uh next one this one okay we're pumping the brakes a little bit these are different kinds of i would like to read the first one let's read the first one yeah hit it
2306.52 2319.16 SPEAKER_00  i like that you saw the word this is me this is what i this is how i slide into dm chaser here
2319.16 2345.40 SPEAKER_03  i like all you wearing the same clothes because it keeps the clocking game playable it saturates the trans aesthetic to a more precise and this is like a fucking patrick statement yeah precise and easy to fetishize archetype over and over again possibly in an autistic way oh my god
2345.40 2374.12 SPEAKER_00  oh this this guy this guy rocks i i love no you're right this is this is the patrick bateman chaser this is incredible i i love i love that he's like yes we i don't know this this dude is the like every kind of chaser they want to be as honest as this guy this is like most chasers i feel like yeah yeah oh my god he's kind of cooking though he's like kind of cooking with that one
2374.12 2393.72 SPEAKER_05  okay and then the one on the right is uh a man named bruce who says canadians are getting fed up and it's a picture of a man in a santa claus suit out front of tim hortons with a sign that says whites are six percent of the world do not fund your replacement don't shop brown be racist or go extinct
2393.72 2421.08 SPEAKER_00  oh jesus christ no there's like i i have been like slowly learning more i've always kind of paid attention to like canadian politics but there's been like this weird thing recently where they they're like a little bit more i knew they were like slightly racist but canadians are like way more racist than i than i think even most americans understand like the tim hortons discourse i don't know if you guys have been following tim's tim hortons discourse over the last like year and
2421.72 2426.92 SPEAKER_05  because they did some like whatever diversity inclusion hr page on their website you know i don't
2426.92 2487.96 SPEAKER_00  know what it is specific it might be something like that but i think it started because there's like a lot of indian immigrants in canada right now and so it like all stems from like indian racism like indian racism is like on the rise in canada right now and like i've seen instances i've talked to people that like live in canada and know a lot about canada and it's like there's like like older generation indian immigrants in canada that are being racist to new indians like it's like shots on all side type of racism to like this new wave of indian racism and i think part of it is like a lot of them are working or just like a certain population work at like tim hortons now or something like that maybe because of like a dei style initiative but it's i don't know the the in the the canadian indian racism has been like insane and this is like the funniest one where it's like this fucking sign with the santa like hat thing i don't know this is it's like a really funny one i saw this one when it went up but i don't know people are getting really comfortable just being like evil like this
2488.52 2497.56 SPEAKER_05  yeah okay do we want the um whimsical chaser or he would choose us or tim hortons or profound races
2500.12 2504.52 SPEAKER_03  i love it obviously i'm all about i love the chaser i mean it's amazing
2505.88 2509.88 SPEAKER_05  but you know the chaser tweets kind of a chaser chaser clears the whimsical chaser
2509.88 2532.36 SPEAKER_00  the whimsical chaser versus profound racist is crazy it separates the trans aesthetic to a more precise and easy to fetish by bucket it's so good i i need a i need a patrick bateman uh voice like somebody doing that voice to read that off i think that would go crazy that would go crazy okay uh so
2532.36 2542.52 SPEAKER_05  now we are in the semi-finals here we've got uh ket versus crack versus the seal team six-year-old lover
2543.48 2550.84 SPEAKER_04  oof god that's a tournament of champions again i'll just reread the the reply for the for the cat
2550.84 2568.68 SPEAKER_05  tweet this is a crack only group if you want to post your little goo goo gaga bushwick bullshit drugs go to reddit and it's versus the the gay pedophile yeah oh you're not men your boys if there was no social media you would be my concubine says the guy who's shot bin Laden
2568.68 2587.72 SPEAKER_00  this is too hard fuck yeah does anyone have a case right now i'm like split down the middle i can i can be swayed either way at the moment if anyone has a case for either one of those
2589.48 2607.24 SPEAKER_04  i mean here's the here's here's what i'll say this is the one argument i'll make on behalf of the cat one is if it weren't the guy who if it wasn't excuse me if it weren't if it wasn't the guy who shot bin Laden this would not be it even it in there it wouldn't even be in the tournament that's yeah no
2607.24 2611.80 SPEAKER_00  because that there's like tweets like that every single day is the thing like like everyone like
2611.80 2616.76 SPEAKER_05  everyone has a quote tweet just like the gay pedophiles are all over x everything app now
2617.48 2631.48 SPEAKER_03  it's just this is one of the most notable one apparently like his whole life was leading to this moment actually it wasn't it wasn't killing obama i'm sorry sorry oh my god osama oh oh shit oh fuck
2633.16 2636.76 SPEAKER_04  finally making the connection the obamas never wanted you to make i think you mean
2636.76 2642.52 SPEAKER_03  he's saying obama yeah it wasn't about killing finlade it was about right this week
2645.32 2671.00 SPEAKER_00  yeah this i think this actually might be the last time he'll be publicly recognized in any serious context like he he will never be cared about like like like what's his name mr bone from the 2016 election like that was his time yeah this is this guy's moment this is his last moment he it's done for him after this and what a way to go out honestly i'm going gay pedophile honestly
2674.28 2676.12 SPEAKER_03  you're hearing that a lot from me
2684.04 2690.84 SPEAKER_00  yeah okay i'm gonna go gay pedophile as well i think yeah i'm i'm also yeah it's it's too good it's too good
2690.84 2705.16 SPEAKER_05  okay uh then we have next up for the semifinals is the whimsical chaser versus john the papist oh you need me to read either or both
2707.16 2747.96 SPEAKER_00  okay i'm gonna make the case for john the papist here because like okay like sure the chaser the the profound chaser or no what was insane the whimsical chaser kind of cooking kind of kind of amazing brain he has on him but like i have a specific fascination into like the the catholic red scarer like born again catholic type of people and it just it's it's an insanely perfect encapsulation of these people's minds and like the discourse they have like like i cannot think of i could not write a more perfect interaction outlining exactly how all of these people are um so i i i really do have to go with john the papist yeah i i think yeah i think
2747.96 2756.84 SPEAKER_03  you're right also the chaser one is almost like it's almost it's almost too pure for this world
2756.84 2794.92 SPEAKER_00  no he's like like i don't know like he's like there there's a there's a negative quality to him like most trans people do not like having these people in their replies for obvious reasons but like i don't know he's he's not nefarious he he just he just knows what he likes he's upfront about it you know yeah he's a pro he's not lying he's not calling he's not calling adults little boys who would be his concubine like come on yeah yeah uh okay yeah i agree with you guys
2796.28 2802.04 SPEAKER_04  also i'm like a i'm a cis straight white guy i can't i can't i can't make any judgments on yeah
2802.04 2817.88 SPEAKER_05  i actually by the way just like alex i don't i don't know anything about this is what i dm june about i was like i don't i can't because because this this did some numbers and like our discord loved that the chase the whimsical chaser tweet i'm like should i put this in like is it icky if i do

2915.88 2937.32 SPEAKER_00  they're they're both almost perfect tweets one one encapsulates the the modern like born again catholic the other one encapsulates the modern online conservative like brained person like almost perfectly like every conservative is is like exactly like like him you know it's i he's not a voting he's
2937.32 2966.12 SPEAKER_05  he's a follower since i'm not a voting member of this uh production i will say one thing the what you brought up june about the the seal team six-year-old lover was how it was kind of an inflection point like that is so true oh that it was like an inflection point we're like oh fuck like trump's gonna win yeah that's very true it was like some sort of tear in space-time fabric when this
2966.12 2979.32 SPEAKER_00  tweet was was written when when people in his world when when people feel comfortable enough to come out as a gay pedophile publicly uh yeah we're in favor of trump it's we're fucked yeah yeah that files for trump
2979.32 2983.56 SPEAKER_03  oh it's like dogs walking around on their hind legs or something
