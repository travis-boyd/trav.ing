0.00 14.24 SPEAKER_00  Welcome to another episode of Left on Red. It's me, your host, November Callie, joined, as always, by my friend Riley Quinn. I introduce things like Kill James Bond now, because I'm so used to introducing that, that it takes over the format.
14.76 18.00 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, that's right. We've watched a movie in book form.
18.00 40.42 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, we've watched a French Euro spy movie. No, it's November and Riley, and this is my pick. I had us read Anthony Weinstein's The Palestine Laboratory, which I thought would be timely, and in some ways is, and in other ways has been, I think, kind of vastly supplanted by events, which is, you know, not its fault, but the fate of a lot of books.
40.42 66.16 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, it's, the Palestine Laboratory is essentially about the Israeli defense and security industry, and how it, unlike every other Western state's defense and security industry, is willing to fund sort of terror, oppression, and sort of right-wing, say, state persecution around the globe.
66.16 83.36 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, and the thesis of the book is, Israel uses Palestine as a laboratory to test these things, to market these things internationally, whether it's weapons or surveillance tech or whatever, and the thrust of this is that if you do not care about Palestine, Palestine cares about you, because these are previews of coming attractions.
83.80 88.30 SPEAKER_01  This is the point that I think the book thinks it's making, which is what you've said now.
88.30 95.48 SPEAKER_01  I think the book, the point that the book is actually making is that Israel is 5% less...
95.48 96.20 SPEAKER_01  Subtle.
96.60 103.24 SPEAKER_01  Yes, exactly. It is 5% less subtle and 5% more venal than every other Western state.
103.26 139.00 SPEAKER_00  I mean, there is a thing in there, because, like, there's a lot of mention of Israeli arms dealers, for instance, and one of the things that sort of right-wingers internationally love them for is the kind of performative fetish for rudeness that I think a lot of the more kind of tactical industry in Israel cultivate of being like, oh, we tell it like it is. We're straight shooters. We're not like these woke Americans, because we will say that you have to racially profile people based on skin color and based on ethnicity, which is what these people want to hear anyway.
139.62 149.64 SPEAKER_01  The sort of... That affective innovation means that the Black Rifle Coffee Company was also born, in a sense, in Israel.
149.76 161.68 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, I mean, like, a lot of sort of... You can find not just a preview of what surveillance tech or what weapons are going to be used to corral a lot more people in both present and future in Israel.
161.68 172.86 SPEAKER_00  You can also find something of the affect, and it's, you know, as I think we're all a lot more intimately aware lately, fucking awful to be around or see.
173.30 179.98 SPEAKER_00  And we're going to see the sort of... The fascism of the future is going to be TikTok dancers on mass graves, which is not great.
180.50 204.20 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, and this is, I think, one of the ways in which we can talk about the book as being surpassed by events, because this is a book fundamentally about experts talking to experts, of high politics talking to high politics, of buyers and sellers, of big technology platforms largely talking to one another, as opposed to what we're seeing now, which is the kind of... That's still certainly happening.
204.32 206.58 SPEAKER_01  It has been happening. It will probably continue to happen.
206.58 220.64 SPEAKER_01  But the dominant mode of how, you know, the ongoing genocide, if you like, Israel's ongoing mode in Gaza and the West Bank, but Gaza especially, is now different from what is described in this book.
220.72 231.20 SPEAKER_00  Yeah. I mean, there's a particularly sort of like, not poorly aged exactly, but overtaken by events thing here, which I'm going to read.
231.20 240.92 SPEAKER_00  Back in 2002, three years before Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon withdrew 9,000 Jewish settlers from Gaza, Israeli historian Van Kreefold predicted division.
241.32 251.64 SPEAKER_00  The only solution is building a wall between us and the other side so tall that even the birds cannot fly over it, so as to avoid any kind of friction for a long, long time in the future.
252.08 259.26 SPEAKER_00  We could formally finish the problem, at least in Gaza, in 48 hours by getting out and building a proper wall.
259.26 263.80 SPEAKER_00  And then, of course, if anybody tries to climb over the wall, we kill him.
264.20 276.80 SPEAKER_00  Of course, we have all seen what happens when that wall inevitably is breached, which is that, you know, unsurprisingly, the people who are on the other end of that settlement, you have decided, go out to, like, kill indiscriminately.
277.14 281.26 SPEAKER_01  Would you say this, that was overtaken by events, or just the prediction is now...
281.98 282.56 SPEAKER_01  I think...
282.56 284.26 SPEAKER_01  Like, there's nothing left for it to predict.
284.26 289.08 SPEAKER_01  It has... its predictive value has been shown to be good, but it predicted something that has now already happened.
289.08 302.48 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, well, I mean, as a good Marxist, right, I believe that a lot of the sort of attempts by Israel to, as the book calls it, prevent an outbreak of peace, you know, contain seeds of their own destruction, right?
302.90 305.28 SPEAKER_00  And this being the prime example.
305.72 315.32 SPEAKER_00  I think it would have been a surprisingly foresighted book to have been able to predict this, to have been able to predict October 7th.
315.32 334.88 SPEAKER_00  And I think the pessimistic assumption is, in the book, is that not only is Palestine going to be a successful sort of, like, testing ground for Israel indefinitely, but that testing ground will sort of, like, expand to Kashmir or to the US-Mexico border.
334.88 338.58 SPEAKER_00  And it already has done this, in some ways.
339.10 346.14 SPEAKER_00  I just... I think it's gonna be less of an easy ride than the people instituting it hope for.
346.40 352.98 SPEAKER_00  And just by virtue of being the book that it is, it's mostly talking to those people, or people who deal with those people.
352.98 356.82 SPEAKER_00  You're not gonna, like, get in and interview Yaya Sinwa for this book, right?
356.82 370.86 SPEAKER_00  And so, what you're doing is you're interviewing people who are either, sort of, like, there's a lot of human rights lawyers in this, there's a lot of, like, Israeli veterans in this, and a lot of, sort of, like, arms dealers and politicians.
371.74 386.20 SPEAKER_00  And they vary on the kind of griminess involved, but in general, they all kind of take it as read that this is going to be something that's sustainable forever.
386.82 391.30 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, and I think the... if we want to talk about sustainability, I think you can also talk about...
391.30 399.78 SPEAKER_01  Looking at what the book talks about as Israel's own history as an arms and surveillance exporting nation.
399.78 403.90 SPEAKER_01  Because if I'm to understand it correctly, we sort of...
403.90 411.04 SPEAKER_01  There was a lot of arms selling in the 1980s to, sort of, fellow traveler states such as South Africa.
411.04 416.26 SPEAKER_01  And that has evolved more recently into things like...
416.26 427.78 SPEAKER_01  Things we've talked about on TF, on the mainline show, about the ability to monitor and create digital twins of everyone in a certain area so you can predict where they're going to be and then, you know, bomb everything within a mile radius.
428.00 428.68 SPEAKER_01  Things like this.
429.14 430.86 SPEAKER_01  Is that... am I to understand that right?
430.98 431.14 SPEAKER_00  Yes, yeah.
431.20 432.60 SPEAKER_00  And I think if you look at...
432.60 435.30 SPEAKER_00  It does give you a brief history of Israel.
435.30 453.92 SPEAKER_00  And it's never... there has always been a need seen on behalf of Israeli policymakers to make arms deals, to approve arms deals, to cultivate friends and allies because Israel is either already a pariah state or two steps away from being one.
454.24 455.94 SPEAKER_00  I have a quote here.
455.94 465.12 SPEAKER_00  In 1985, a former head of the Neset Foreign Relations Committee, Johanna Ramati, gave a speech at Florida International University that was brutally honest about his country's calculations.
466.06 467.60 SPEAKER_00  Israel is a pariah state.
468.02 471.64 SPEAKER_00  When people ask us for something, we cannot afford to ask questions about ideology.
472.08 477.58 SPEAKER_00  The only type of regime that Israel would not aid would be one that is anti-American.
478.10 484.86 SPEAKER_00  Also, if we can aid a country that it may be inconvenient for the US to help, we would be cutting off our nose to spite our face not to.
484.86 506.14 SPEAKER_00  And so you see time and again that Israel makes deals with all sorts of incredibly genocidal, anti-Semitic, sort of hostile dictatorial regimes throughout the world, often on sort of like as an extension, as like an arm's length extension of the US, often in defiance of the US.
506.40 517.48 SPEAKER_00  One of the things, the most interesting things in the book is the treatment that Ukraine gets from Israel, where Israel wants to stay sort of like on Putin's good side.
518.40 522.48 SPEAKER_00  And so Ukraine is like begging and begging for this Israeli technology.
523.48 528.30 SPEAKER_00  I remember Zelensky said that he wanted his vision of Ukraine was as a big Israel after the war.
528.30 536.38 SPEAKER_00  And the Israelis are like, no, because we need Putin on side because the Russians are in Syria.
536.74 539.84 SPEAKER_00  So, and it's just, it's pure realpolitik.
539.98 548.64 SPEAKER_00  And I think this is one of my critiques of the book is that there's a lot here and it's all revealing.
548.64 549.78 SPEAKER_00  It's all persuasive.
550.60 552.76 SPEAKER_00  Very little of it is revelatory.
553.00 561.42 SPEAKER_00  And it is mostly in rooms talking to people who believe that everything is going to like continue this way forever, which is not a settled issue.
561.60 563.72 SPEAKER_01  I want to stop you, I guess, for one second.
563.96 566.60 SPEAKER_01  Let's unpack this question of, yes, exactly.
566.68 570.28 SPEAKER_01  I would like to stop you forever and begin talking about my opinions.
571.34 573.04 SPEAKER_01  Warhammer 40,000, good or bad?
573.20 573.42 SPEAKER_01  Good.
573.42 574.56 SPEAKER_01  Okay, next.
575.20 575.60 SPEAKER_01  No.
576.28 586.38 SPEAKER_01  So I want to stop and unpack what you've said about like the, that this book talks to people who believe, and I think we can get into a few of the examples that Lowenstein uses later on.
587.06 593.66 SPEAKER_01  But that this book believes that sort of these processes kind of are just going to go on.
593.88 615.64 SPEAKER_01  And I wanted to, is this because ultimately even the people who are resisting it in the official capacities, people like human rights lawyers, as you say, sort of disillusioned or very eager, let's say, to brag, veterans are all sort of within the business of managing sort of Israel as a kind of rogue actor.
615.64 617.88 SPEAKER_00  I have a perfect example for you.
618.16 622.88 SPEAKER_00  So one of, another criticism I have for the book, it relies on relatively few sources.
622.88 635.66 SPEAKER_00  And a lot of it's sort of like domestic Israeli politics is coming from an interview with this Israeli human rights lawyer, Etai Mack, who does some like interesting, like liberal work.
635.88 646.16 SPEAKER_00  Like for a while, one of his causes was trying to get Yad Vashem, the Holocaust museum, to not invite whichever dictator Israel was currently wooing.
646.16 660.36 SPEAKER_00  And this is like a routine thing that like, you know, some of the like Burmese generals who are currently perpetrating a genocide went to Israel to buy arms and surveillance technology and got given a tour of the Holocaust memorial.
661.24 669.78 SPEAKER_00  But this guy, Etai Mack, if you look him up, it has sort of like publications in Haaretz are Israel is not committing genocide in Gaza.
670.60 674.30 SPEAKER_00  Unlike South Africa's ANC, Hamas is not waging a just war for liberation.
674.30 679.42 SPEAKER_00  Israel must topple genocide or Hamas, but not by killing countless Palestinian civilians.
679.82 688.94 SPEAKER_00  So this is like a guy who is as left wing as you can plausibly be in Israel without joining like Gush Shalom or something.
689.94 702.34 SPEAKER_00  And so that's a major limitation is just that there is not an Israeli left so much anymore that is willing to make these kind of criticisms, you know?
702.34 708.66 SPEAKER_01  You could say there was that one lady who ran a Taylor Swift fan account that went to jail.
708.86 709.66 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, pretty much.
709.70 710.92 SPEAKER_00  It's like a couple of kids.
711.04 721.26 SPEAKER_00  I mean, the thing is as well that a lot of the criticism when it comes from within Israel, when it comes from the diaspora is from a kind of liberal Zionist place, right?
721.26 729.20 SPEAKER_00  Of being like, well, Israel is a beautiful dream and we want it to live up to its ideals of being the moral Jewish state.
729.28 731.74 SPEAKER_00  There is some of this in like a conservative mode as well.
731.96 740.72 SPEAKER_00  Like some of the uglier, more secretive arms deals are sometimes opposed by sort of more traditional conservatives in Israel when they come out.
740.72 761.22 SPEAKER_00  And at no point is it kind of, in some ways, the real freaks, the real kind of like hardline right wing Zionists, and this includes like Ben-Gurion when you go back into stuff that he said, have a clearer eyed view of what it actually means to have a kind of Zionist state project, right?
761.22 768.36 SPEAKER_00  There's a quote from Ben-Gurion when he's in Iran secretly doing arms deals to prop up the Shah.
768.94 773.32 SPEAKER_00  And he says the relationship between Israel and Iran has to be like a love affair.
773.42 774.28 SPEAKER_00  It's better in secret.
775.02 776.86 SPEAKER_00  And it's just like, yeah, okay.
777.30 779.42 SPEAKER_00  These guys get it.
780.12 788.12 SPEAKER_00  The guys who are being sort of like performatively rude selling submachine guns to like Guatemalan cops get it.
788.12 789.12 SPEAKER_00  And then –
789.12 808.32 SPEAKER_01  Well, it's because they're allowed to look the situation in the face because they're allowed to say this is what is happening and it's good, as opposed to the people who are only – whose ability to see it is necessarily compromised because their criticisms of it, their work against it, must be within the rules.
808.84 810.06 SPEAKER_01  That means you can never see it.
810.38 812.16 SPEAKER_01  You can never know fully.
812.50 814.04 SPEAKER_00  Before October 7th as well.
814.04 825.90 SPEAKER_00  Like the Israeli left or the Israeli kind of like liberal opposition, such as it is, was already pretty sort of complacent because I think they had, like Lowenstein, this like pessimistic view.
825.96 827.34 SPEAKER_00  There's another quote here.
827.82 837.76 SPEAKER_00  Whereas in the years after the Six Day War, Israel faced a barrage of international criticism for its colonization policies, the 21st century has seen a growing alliance between Israel and many Arab states.
837.96 838.62 SPEAKER_00  It's gone now.
838.62 844.64 SPEAKER_00  Between nations in Africa and Latin America, Israel now produces most of its own missile defense technology.
845.06 849.48 SPEAKER_00  Global isolation never happened, despite the fears and wishes of some that it might.
850.14 858.14 SPEAKER_00  According to Israeli polling, a majority of its Jewish citizens do not overly worry about solving the conflict with the Palestinians, nor do they fear isolation.
858.64 861.12 SPEAKER_00  The status quo suits them just fine.
861.12 870.54 SPEAKER_00  There's actually a quote from Naftali Bennett in September of 2021, where he just says, Israelis don't wake up in the morning thinking about the conflict, which is probably true for 2021.
870.90 889.28 SPEAKER_00  Like, I think this policy of containment, of separation, of not thinking about it, of sort of like just covering, just throwing a big rug over it and hoping for the best, which as we've seen has like worked out not necessarily to Israel's advantage, is still like in full flow when this book is written.
889.28 892.58 SPEAKER_00  Let's also talk about something that we've hinted at, right?
892.96 910.12 SPEAKER_01  One of the things we've hinted at is, okay, well, there is this view of the occupation that is, I'd say, you know, promulgated by the Israeli right and then being sort of unable to be looked at by most mainstream critics.
911.18 918.78 SPEAKER_01  And that view of the occupation allows Israel to, as you say, develop things like their Pegasus spyware tooling.
918.78 923.10 SPEAKER_01  It also allows them to develop new legal technologies, such as like indefinite detention.
923.74 934.40 SPEAKER_01  I mean, let's talk about some of the examples that Lowenstein uses about what things that have been invented, sort of by Israel and Palestine, and then exported.
935.32 942.36 SPEAKER_01  So there's a, I want to start, there's a good passage at the beginning of the sixth chapter about mass surveillance.
942.52 946.20 SPEAKER_01  This is one I think that most news consumers will be very familiar with.
946.20 955.12 SPEAKER_01  Griselda Triana is a Mexican journalist, human rights activist, and activist whose husband, Javier Valdez Cardenas, was slain by a drug cartel in 2017.
956.08 961.60 SPEAKER_01  Valdez was the co-founder of the media outlet Rio Doce, which investigated corruption and crime and wrote about the drug war.
962.12 968.56 SPEAKER_01  A grenade was thrown into his office in 2009, but he'd received death threats in the months before his murder, nevertheless continuing his groundbreaking work.
968.98 972.96 SPEAKER_01  Ten days after the killing, Triana started receiving unexpected text messages on her phone.
972.96 987.46 SPEAKER_01  She had no idea that they were suspicious until almost one year later, when it was discovered that there had been attempts to infiltrate her phone with the Pegasus system, a phone hacking tool sold by Israeli surveillance company NSO Group, almost certainly by elements within the Mexican state.
987.80 991.02 SPEAKER_01  She said, Before Javier's murder, I did not know that we were being monitored.
991.62 1001.46 SPEAKER_01  Javier had never informed me about the possibility of phone hacking, but he knew the risks of reporting criminal activities, but even so was aware that someone had to document the atrocities of criminal organizations.
1001.88 1003.34 SPEAKER_01  My reaction to his death was tremendous.
1003.54 1009.98 SPEAKER_01  He was my husband and father of my two children, and I was shocked because he didn't even want to leave Sinaloa, even though he knew the cartels could kill him.
1010.18 1011.70 SPEAKER_01  But why they were targeted by Pegasus?
1011.70 1021.18 SPEAKER_01  She said she believed it was because, quote, They thought by tapping the phones they could get data from various sources of information or listen to calls related to Javier's investigations.
1021.58 1029.10 SPEAKER_01  But to this day, she has never been told by the Mexican state why it spied on her and no court case for the man accused of masterminding her husband's death.
1029.46 1036.88 SPEAKER_01  They claim the state and the company NSO claim that Pegasus is solely used for the purposes of fighting crime and terrorism.
1036.88 1048.60 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, so Pegasus gets everywhere, and it's sort of like the flagship tech surveillance product, or at least the flagship hacking product of Israel.
1049.02 1062.76 SPEAKER_00  It's curious, by the way, this company NSO, there's a couple of companies, NSO and Black Cube, there are more, but those are the two most prominent ones, that are often described as Israeli private companies, and they don't really occupy that position.
1062.76 1068.12 SPEAKER_00  They're closer to being like deniable state agencies.
1069.44 1078.26 SPEAKER_00  You look at the sort of like composition of them, the control of them, the, you know, the IDF has sort of like a veto over pretty much everything they do.
1078.34 1083.74 SPEAKER_00  The boards, the executives are all like sort of veterans of these like IDF second units and stuff.
1085.06 1091.12 SPEAKER_00  And yeah, so Pegasus is sold very, very widely, and is used often very clumsily.
1091.12 1108.10 SPEAKER_00  Like, this is a thing that I think does recurrent, is interesting, is that a lot of this stuff is, in many ways, less slick, and less subtle than people imagine when they think of as like state level, or near state level surveillance.
1109.34 1117.68 SPEAKER_00  Especially when it's in the hands of some, you know, like cartel compromised Mexican, like special agent or whatever, is people know that their phones are being fucked with.
1117.96 1119.74 SPEAKER_00  You start getting like weird calls.
1119.74 1123.88 SPEAKER_00  It's like the kind of 60s thing of hearing like, like tapping in your phone line.
1125.08 1130.36 SPEAKER_00  You know, people, people are very much aware of it, and it gets to some strange places.
1130.36 1146.40 SPEAKER_00  Like, even in Mexico, it's so sort of like useful and investigative tool that like, one group of people who were surveilled by the Mexican government with Pegasus, were advocates of a soda tax.
1148.52 1150.72 SPEAKER_01  This is the only just use of Pegasus.
1150.72 1160.46 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, they were surveilling the like, Mexican Mike Bloomberg to be like, no, you have to, fucking Haritos has people in the Mexican government, I guess.
1160.46 1164.36 SPEAKER_00  Um, no, they were surveilling Mexican Morgan Spurlock.
1166.52 1182.30 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, I mean, there's, there's a sort of like frightening or intended to be frightening quite about this surveillance, um, where, which is, um, today you're able to stop and identify, uh, identify and stop surveillance of the next Nelson Mandela before he even knows he's Nelson Mandela.
1182.68 1188.94 SPEAKER_00  Uh, in this case, it's, you're able to identify and stop the next Morgan Spurlock before he even knows he's Morgan Spurlock.
1188.94 1197.44 SPEAKER_00  Um, I mean, it's so like, we must preserve, we must preserve the sugar, the cane sugar content of Haritos.
1197.72 1209.48 SPEAKER_00  I mean, the thing is right, a lot of the marketing about this, particularly the, the cyber and like weapons are slightly different where weapons, you can have the guys go out to, to Guatemala or to Arizona and be like, yeah, listen, we're just like you.
1209.56 1210.82 SPEAKER_00  We are also racist, right?
1210.82 1218.36 SPEAKER_00  Uh, with the, the sort of the cyber thing, you want this idea of like sort of seamless, frictionless, very, very efficacious surveillance.
1218.36 1224.82 SPEAKER_00  Uh, and then the people that you sell it to, and to be honest, even the people who are selling it are just dumb thugs.
1224.98 1229.86 SPEAKER_00  And so like they sold Pegasus to, to Saudi Arabia, to, to Mohammed bin Salman.
1230.02 1238.32 SPEAKER_00  And one of the things that the, uh, MBS did with it was hack Jeff Bezos, his phone, because Bezos texted him one time and he got his number.
1239.34 1245.06 SPEAKER_00  It's just, it's, it's so, um, it's so stupid is the thing.
1245.24 1260.68 SPEAKER_00  And when you look, why, when you trace this back, when you pull the thread that goes from NSO back to, uh, the, uh, like IDF surveillance unit, unit 8, 200, and you talk to the veterans of it, some of them feel bad.
1260.76 1269.48 SPEAKER_00  Some of them feel good about it, but most of what they're doing is ultimately, like, you are getting into people's phones in order to blackmail them.
1269.48 1278.40 SPEAKER_00  You are getting into their phones to find out that they're gay and then blackmail them with that to become an asset or that they're in debt or that they're cheating on their wives.
1278.84 1291.10 SPEAKER_00  Um, and it's, it's all really very tawdry stuff, but the way that it's sold internationally is, you know, lots of kind of videos of like, uh, code appearing on screens and big, like swooshing satellites and stuff.
1291.22 1295.92 SPEAKER_00  And it's actually what it is, is reading a guy's like grinder messages or something.
1296.44 1299.40 SPEAKER_00  Um, and again, it's interesting.
1299.48 1311.38 SPEAKER_00  because, um, there's basically no one that Pegasus cannot be sold to except for Ukraine, who keeps begging and begging for it.
1311.52 1312.68 SPEAKER_00  And, and the Israelis are like, no.
1313.10 1320.32 SPEAKER_00  Um, and the U S because Pegasus is designed from the ground up so that it cannot be used to surveil a U S based number.
1320.74 1323.48 SPEAKER_00  Um, it, it works on the like country code.
1323.56 1326.78 SPEAKER_00  And if it has a plus one country code, which is the U S then it can't be.
1327.22 1333.32 SPEAKER_01  The funny thing is Canada, Canada ends up under that umbrella entirely by accident and without consideration.
1333.32 1333.70 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1334.14 1348.12 SPEAKER_00  Um, but, but the thing is then what NSO did, uh, the company that makes it is they offered a, a workaround to that, to the Americans to be like, Hey, Hey, do you want to spy on your own people's cell phones with this?
1348.62 1356.40 SPEAKER_00  And I, I don't know that the FBI or the CIA need with the NSA, I guess needed, uh, needed Pegasus to do this.
1356.40 1364.62 SPEAKER_00  But it is very funny that it's like, you kind of, you can sell the thing, uh, and then also sell the work around, you know?
1365.56 1365.80 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1365.88 1365.98 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1366.04 1377.88 SPEAKER_01  It's the, um, and then sort of going back to sort of talking about Palestine as the laboratory for this stuff, you know, it's, um, you can say, okay, well, this is, this, this is where I sort of always think it's a bit strange, right?
1377.94 1393.42 SPEAKER_01  Where again, we sort of think about overtaken by events because these are things that, you know, Israel might've been concerned about in Palestine at some point, which is gathering like plausible evidence about someone enough, or at least appearing to do that, right?
1393.74 1396.12 SPEAKER_01  Before then doing something to them.
1396.52 1399.36 SPEAKER_01  But the pretense of that has gone now completely out the window.
1399.48 1400.84 SPEAKER_01  It has been out the window for a while.
1401.12 1401.30 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1401.54 1401.70 SPEAKER_01  Right.
1401.76 1409.36 SPEAKER_01  So the, you don't need to hack someone's phone anymore when you've declared everyone an enemy combatant, which is effectively not really an Israeli innovation.
1409.36 1410.70 SPEAKER_01  It's a U S innovation.
1410.70 1414.06 SPEAKER_00  I mean, you know, Britain in many ways was here first.
1414.46 1419.36 SPEAKER_00  I, at some point want us to read something about Frank kits and then sort of like invention of counterinsurgency.
1419.94 1426.78 SPEAKER_00  Um, but yeah, it's sort of, um, both NSO and, and black cube, black cube is, is different.
1426.92 1433.36 SPEAKER_00  So black cube, um, if, if the NSO is sort of like an extension of the IDF, black cube is an extension of Mossad, more or less.
1433.36 1438.28 SPEAKER_00  Like these are sort of like things that were spun off by former intelligence officers.
1438.44 1445.58 SPEAKER_00  Uh, and for, uh, you know, the NSO is the sort of like military, very intelligence, uh, guys and black cube is the civilian intelligence guys.
1445.92 1450.88 SPEAKER_00  Um, also the firm that Harvey Weinstein hired to surveil his accusers, by the way.
1451.24 1463.58 SPEAKER_00  Um, but there, that sort of related part of what their branding is, is be, is sort of be that much edgier to be like, we will go to the places that NSO won't, we'll do the things that they don't do.
1464.00 1468.72 SPEAKER_00  Um, and the result is inevitably much dumber.
1468.94 1471.86 SPEAKER_00  Like, uh, the sort of, I have a quote here.
1472.00 1480.58 SPEAKER_00  Does it matter as a, as a number of respected national security journalists told me that black cube operatives are often exposed as amateurs who cannot competently do their jobs?
1480.58 1489.34 SPEAKER_00  A number of intelligent sources told me that the company's willingness to go further and push the legal limits more than many other firms meant that it stood out as desirable to potential clients.
1489.70 1497.56 SPEAKER_00  But according to Barry Meyer, a former New York Times journalist and author of a 2021 book spooked on the private spy world, black cube wasn't good at what it did.
1497.56 1502.98 SPEAKER_00  The firm, despite the high prices it charged clients, kept recycling tactics from one case to another.
1503.24 1506.96 SPEAKER_00  The result was that some of its operations looked like bungling low-rent clown shows.
1507.34 1512.82 SPEAKER_01  Well, again, this is, how different also is that really from any of their US equivalents?
1513.26 1542.54 SPEAKER_01  You know, whether you want to talk about like the, um, the official, uh, sort of US intelligence, uh, efforts to infiltrate Cuba that resulted in a kind of series of hilarious, like, uh, candid camera TV documentaries, or, you know, more in a more modern sense where, you know, the, the 11 guys decided to go have a, have a quick coup on Venezuela or indeed our favorite, um, you know, Tim Spicer, Mark Thatcher, and the rest, uh, deciding to have a go, have a pop at Equatorial Guinea.
1542.76 1547.38 SPEAKER_01  It's you again and again, these people show themselves up as immense amateurs.
1547.70 1548.64 SPEAKER_00  They're both incompetent.
1548.64 1552.96 SPEAKER_00  And also these are things that are difficult to do well, even if you're not incompetent.
1553.20 1564.26 SPEAKER_00  And I, I think I do get the impression, from this book and from other things that Israel is like, notably worse at this than a lot of other countries doing it.
1564.30 1567.56 SPEAKER_00  It's just that they export more widely in the course of doing this.
1567.64 1571.14 SPEAKER_00  Something which is also like a sort of like state program, right?
1571.14 1578.94 SPEAKER_00  If you, if you're putting Pegasus in, in your systems, I just assume if you buy anything from like a state, that state's intelligence agencies will have access to it.
1578.94 1579.12 SPEAKER_00  Right?
1579.12 1585.04 SPEAKER_00  So like anyone using Pegasus, uh, is gonna sort of like, that's, that's going back to Israel.
1585.22 1588.90 SPEAKER_00  Israel has like its own sort of like countermeasures against that.
1589.14 1593.86 SPEAKER_00  Um, and so the, the result is that like you, you sell this thing, you make some money on it.
1593.88 1598.82 SPEAKER_00  And by the way, you also have a bunch of details of people who wanted a soda tax in Mexico city, I guess,
1599.18 1601.58 None  you, you know, which ones are gay.
1601.58 1602.38 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, exactly.
1602.46 1606.98 SPEAKER_00  I'm, I'm assembling, it's like a come town, but I'm assembling a database of gay Mexicans.
1607.56 1611.08 SPEAKER_00  Like, what is the use of this?
1611.18 1612.18 SPEAKER_00  Dunno, might come in handy.
1613.32 1614.20 SPEAKER_00  Look, look,
1614.24 1620.32 SPEAKER_01  you'd rather need and you'd rather have and not need a database of gay Mexicans. You need and not have it.
1620.48 1625.36 SPEAKER_01  You'd be so embarrassed to be caught short without your database of gay Mexican soda activists.
1625.36 1629.00 SPEAKER_00  I'm going to Mexico city and I want to have gay sex.
1629.00 1631.38 SPEAKER_00  If only there was someone I could call about this.
1631.58 1634.62 SPEAKER_00  And a guy from black cube just hands me his business card.
1636.74 1644.14 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, I mean, and inevitably, like when this does spill over and get detected, there are like huge repercussions.
1644.24 1650.54 SPEAKER_00  If the way that you can judge how competent people are at doing these things is how often they get caught doing it.
1651.58 1655.38 SPEAKER_00  For Israeli surveillance, like the answer is fairly regularly.
1655.38 1661.34 SPEAKER_00  Like, um, they get caught spying on BDS activists in the US.
1661.58 1663.42 SPEAKER_00  Uh, they get caught in Mexico.
1663.42 1686.50 SPEAKER_00  And essentially, like, when the, the sort of like investigative journalism, uh, and, and whistleblowing discovers the logs of like what Pegasus has been used for in part, um, the sort of the answer from the top of NSO is, well, you know, we knew this stuff was time limited anyway, whatever, you know, uh, we, we got out while the going is good.
1686.60 1689.12 SPEAKER_00  And now we have this database of gay Mexicans.
1689.12 1691.22 SPEAKER_00  So it was, it was worth it.
1693.86 1695.96 SPEAKER_01  I just love a worked example, you know?
1696.80 1697.24 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1697.52 1725.00 SPEAKER_01  So this is, this is, I think it's, it's worth, there is just a, again, like list item after item, after item, after item of, uh, in this book of examples of like this, uh, technology being used, uh, either by like the authoritarian, like the daughters of, of a previous authoritarian state leaders to dig up dirt on like the current governments, or, uh, as you say, Harvey Weinstein, or it's endless sort of subversions of what you'd consider to be sort of basic decency.
1725.40 1728.10 SPEAKER_00  That's the sort of phone end of the surveillance.
1728.26 1739.14 SPEAKER_00  The other end of it is the kind of like predictive surveillance, predictive policing, um, in particular, there's this, the idea of like digital clones, right?
1739.28 1743.76 SPEAKER_00  Um, do we want to talk about, I think it's called black wolf here.
1744.18 1744.70 SPEAKER_00  Yes,
1744.84 1745.12 SPEAKER_01  please.
1745.50 1749.26 SPEAKER_00  It's blue wolf. As you know, your phone is being hacked.
1749.40 1755.48 SPEAKER_00  You're also being surveilled by, by cameras, by soldiers, um, in the occupied territories.
1755.88 1768.76 SPEAKER_00  And, uh, I, I know here starting in 2019, Israeli soldiers used the blue wolf app to capture Palestinian faces, which were then compared to a massive database of images dubbed the Facebook for Palestinians.
1768.76 1774.86 SPEAKER_00  A classic surveillance industry thing here of being like, it's the civilian product of surveillance.
1775.28 1778.60 SPEAKER_00  Um, it's, it's the Uber of, yeah.
1779.14 1784.42 SPEAKER_00  Soldiers were told to compete by taking the most photos of Palestinians and the most prolific would win prizes.
1784.42 1795.86 SPEAKER_00  Blue wolf was a smaller version of the wolf pack database, which contained the personal details of virtually every Palestinian in the West Bank, including educational status, photos, security level, and family history.
1796.46 1806.82 SPEAKER_00  Soldiers in the West Bank were instructed in 2022 to enter the details and photos of at least 50 Palestinians into the blue wolf system every shift, and were not allowed to end their shift until they did so.
1806.82 1819.74 SPEAKER_00  Which, again, doing the kind of like tech industry precariat work on like occupation conscripts is profoundly fucking bleak, right?
1819.88 1821.92 SPEAKER_00  But it, it means that you, and again,
1822.00 1824.04 SPEAKER_01  ask, where's the innovation, right?
1824.38 1838.94 SPEAKER_01  So there's the, some, because some of the innovation, yeah, in the terms of the like, the actual technology being used is, um, is, is, is invented in Israel, at least made in Israel with 5% fewer guardrails than it is elsewhere.
1839.62 1846.02 SPEAKER_01  But, you know, that, that kind of, um, work incentivization, that's, uh, that's a, that's around the world.
1846.12 1850.62 SPEAKER_01  That's a sort of, that is a kind of West wide, if you like,
1850.78 1851.20 SPEAKER_00  invention.
1851.20 1856.02 SPEAKER_01  That just ends up getting sort of poured into this toxic combination in Israel.
1856.10 1865.22 SPEAKER_00  Yeah. And, and the point of this is ostensibly security, and there is really no security rationale for doing this, as we have had, you know, it's a uselessness proven.
1865.24 1865.72 SPEAKER_00  Right.
1866.14 1868.44 SPEAKER_00  Um, but it doesn't matter.
1868.44 1868.72 SPEAKER_00  Right.
1868.72 1874.16 SPEAKER_00  Because it's, it, you know, a way of, uh, maintaining the defense industry.
1874.16 1880.30 SPEAKER_00  You can sort of like then say, well, it's, it's being used in the West bank or in Gaza right now.
1880.40 1887.26 SPEAKER_00  Uh, therefore you, you know, a dictator in South Asia or wherever need to buy this technology.
1887.70 1898.64 SPEAKER_00  Um, and I think the thing is there's Israel had constructed this occupation with no real understanding of how, how to measure its effectiveness or ineffectiveness.
1898.64 1907.60 SPEAKER_00  Um, and so you were left in this environment where owners of these firms could then say, well, this is absolutely essential.
1907.60 1921.62 SPEAKER_00  you know, it is absolutely essential that we make every conscript in the West bank take like 50 photos of Palestinians a day, um, in order to like secure those contracts in order to, uh, to, to keep that money rolling in.
1921.62 1932.24 SPEAKER_00  when most of the like stuff that Israeli, uh, intelligence thought was most effective was the grimy kind of like, uh, is this guy gay or not?
1932.28 1936.26 SPEAKER_00  Which you're not finding out in the course of like taking photos of people on the street.
1936.84 1936.94 SPEAKER_00  Um,
1937.40 1946.98 None  well, I, I, I guess there's some of the logic that you're, that you're outlining here is kind of just the logic of any amount of war occupation.
1946.98 1956.98 SPEAKER_01  And we could even sort of take it back to when we talked about security in the field of security studies and how security is to be politically understood, which is that the thing about security is that it's potentially infinite.
1957.18 1963.90 SPEAKER_01  You can all, because, because you will never know 100% sure whether you have mitigated some risk or another from happening.
1964.08 1966.84 SPEAKER_01  There is all, there is always more things you can do.
1966.84 1974.18 SPEAKER_01  And so, you know, the, you can do one, one million ineffective things, right?
1974.26 1977.94 SPEAKER_01  Because you need to, the most important thing you can assure yourself of is security.
1978.68 1986.06 SPEAKER_01  And off the back of it, you basically get, as, as Lowenstein describes, a laboratory for developing products for sale to anyone with money to buy them.
1986.64 1995.20 SPEAKER_01  And so, you know, it doesn't, it's, and so you, you get one million ways of measuring whether or not this occupation is effective that don't really measure whether or not it's effective.
1995.46 2001.12 SPEAKER_01  That, and that doesn't really matter because you're just, you're making a gadget and throwing it at a thing.
2001.12 2009.94 SPEAKER_01  And because it's a security issue that you're throwing it at, all that matters is that it, it does something, that it, that it whizzes a bang.
2010.08 2011.32 SPEAKER_01  It doesn't have to be effective.
2011.32 2014.84 SPEAKER_01  It just has to be shown to be in operation in some way.
2014.94 2021.72 SPEAKER_00  I have a sort of great example from the, the weapon side, which is not addressed as much in the book, but, but is important.
2022.14 2025.24 SPEAKER_00  The great march of return was both a lab and a showroom.
2025.52 2034.20 SPEAKER_00  Most sophisticated new weapon used against the Palestinian protesters was the sea of tears, a drone that dropped tear gas canisters on a desired area.
2034.82 2041.12 SPEAKER_00  Despite Israeli claims of accuracy, a tent full of Palestinian women and children had tear gas dropped onto them, as did groups of reporters.
2041.54 2048.08 SPEAKER_00  I mean, obviously not that that's necessarily a flaw from the Israeli perspective, but I think two things here.
2048.18 2060.82 SPEAKER_00  First of all, having your sort of like, are we the bad guys moment of being like, well, what have you designed to deploy against this peaceful, or like, uh, what have you designed to deploy against this peaceful march for, you know, to the border fence?
2060.90 2063.50 SPEAKER_00  Oh, well, you know, the, the sea of tears drone.
2063.88 2066.34 SPEAKER_00  Um, we, we, we called it that cause we're the good guys.
2066.56 2075.86 SPEAKER_00  Um, but, but also like what it actually is, is it's a quad copter with some like CS gas grenades strapped to the underside of it.
2076.42 2077.24 SPEAKER_01  Like so many things.
2077.24 2081.06 SPEAKER_01  This goes back to their innovation is just their willingness to do.
2081.28 2081.66 SPEAKER_00  absolutely.
2082.22 2089.36 SPEAKER_00  Which again, is like, this is something that the fascists, that the far right sort of like see much more clearly.
2089.88 2098.38 SPEAKER_00  Um, you know, I, I think if you sort of like are approaching this from, uh, like a liberal Zionist perspective where it's like, well, how could they do this?
2098.46 2113.34 SPEAKER_00  The answer is, well, how could they not, you know, because, uh, as far as, uh, the Israeli right, the concern, the reason why there is an Israel is because of solely the willingness to like, do and keep doing the sort of the brutal and the unthinkable.
2113.94 2137.36 SPEAKER_01  And if you want to talk about sort of how some of that then gets paired up with similar areas in the U S Loenstein talks about the, um, Arizona, Israel access where, you know, like, like guys like Sheriff Joe are all too eager to show a, that they're very tough because they like hanging around with some of these rough and tough talking, um, uh, uh,
2137.36 2144.70 SPEAKER_00  sort of Israeli colonels. Like, yeah, I, I, I have a quote here, um, from, from Colonel Danny Tirza, who was architect of the West bank wall.
2145.14 2149.80 SPEAKER_00  if the sheriffs in the United States have one thing in common with the Israelis, they are not polite.
2150.18 2155.42 SPEAKER_00  They are straight talkers, which, uh, oh, to be a fly in on the wall in that room.
2155.84 2171.66 SPEAKER_00  Um, there's, there's actually a quote from like the mayor of Tucson, um, who's like speaking at one of these conventions where he's trying to get like, um, Israeli arms dealers and, uh, American like sheriffs and border guards in the same room where he's like, you know, in Arizona, it, it looks like Israel.
2171.66 2174.32 SPEAKER_00  You spin yourself around a few times and you could think that you're in Israel.
2174.78 2177.34 SPEAKER_00  It's sort of similar terrain, right?
2177.70 2177.88 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
2177.94 2182.52 SPEAKER_00  It's, it's, it's very effective marketing this, but it's, you know, not just there.
2182.74 2185.08 SPEAKER_00  Uh, Europe is absolutely as implicated.
2185.38 2187.52 SPEAKER_00  There's a lot about frontex in this book,
2187.58 2191.64 SPEAKER_01  which is Greece, uh, Greece, you are the shield of Europe.
2191.90 2198.88 SPEAKER_01  Please again, take some of these exact tactics that Israel would, would deploy on the great March of return, for example, use them here.
2198.96 2213.26 SPEAKER_00  This is the thing that like not to be like the Israelis are all cheap thugs and Europeans are much more subtle about this because Europe has plenty of cheap thugs, but frontex has a layer of ideology over it where when it buys Israeli drones, right?
2213.28 2217.02 SPEAKER_00  When it buys the fucking sea of tears without the tear gas canisters on it.
2217.22 2226.46 SPEAKER_00  Um, it's using those for humanitarian purposes because the surveillance that it's doing is looking for migrant vessels, which are presumably going to be in distress.
2226.46 2248.04 SPEAKER_00  Um, and what this ultimately does, if you do as frontex has, and like forced, uh, international humanitarian ships out of the Mediterranean to vastly empower the Libyan coast guards and heavy air quotes, uh, and, you know, empower the Greek coast guard to do forcible pushbacks, uh, and, and even sinkings.
2248.42 2251.20 SPEAKER_00  What you're doing there is, well, I have a quote here.
2251.20 2257.58 SPEAKER_00  If an actual armed boat or suspicious looking vessel is approaching the drone operator alerts a patrol boat, which will arrive at the scene.
2257.92 2264.80 SPEAKER_00  If it looks like a leaky refugee boat, the drone operator could always take his time and the patrol boat will leave too late so that there is no one left to save.
2265.10 2266.34 SPEAKER_00  This is the key difference.
2266.34 2273.10 SPEAKER_00  And the real reason that the drones are a technological upgrade for the coast guard, it gives them the option to let refugees drown.
2273.68 2286.64 SPEAKER_00  So in the course of seeing more clearly in the course of having more surveillance, it allows more, uh, inhumanity because it allows you to lie about it's your own sort of like inefficiency.
2287.26 2289.74 SPEAKER_01  You're, you, you know where to put your inefficiency.
2289.74 2289.88 SPEAKER_00  Absolutely.
2290.06 2296.16 SPEAKER_00  And the Israeli Greek, uh, diplomatic relationship is explored sort of like at length.
2296.30 2301.58 SPEAKER_00  Um, it's, it's sort of like the one thing that all Greek parties more or less can agree on is to keep the Israelis on side.
2301.82 2307.68 SPEAKER_00  Um, and there is one fascinating detail which, uh, really, really struck me.
2307.68 2308.74 SPEAKER_00  It's just sort of thrown in.
2308.74 2310.14 SPEAKER_00  It's not really of consequence in the book.
2310.56 2328.42 SPEAKER_00  Um, Israel's defense minister, Benny Gantz in 2022 suggested that Greek islands should be bought to create a haven for the Jewish people in case of emergency as a place for Jewish refugees in times of war, which I thought that's what it, the point of Israel was supposed to be, to Zionist.
2328.60 2329.66 SPEAKER_00  Double Israel.
2329.66 2331.92 SPEAKER_00  Israel too is going to be a fucking Mykonos.
2332.02 2332.26 SPEAKER_00  Okay.
2334.18 2350.52 SPEAKER_00  It's just, that is like a small detail of like a guy who has, been a lifelong Zionist who has devoted his entire life to the service of, uh, like Israel as a state being like, we should probably have a backup to this just in case, you know, he, he just wants his hurts.
2350.52 2350.92 SPEAKER_00  or whatever.
2350.92 2352.08 SPEAKER_00  Or Kios or whatever.
2352.72 2353.12 SPEAKER_00  He's like,
2353.18 2357.58 SPEAKER_01  if, if you will it again, it will still not be a dream a second time.
2359.04 2360.74 SPEAKER_00  It's just, just baffling.
2361.10 2371.16 SPEAKER_00  But, um, but yeah, and, and so from Greece, these things sort of, or, uh, from Italy, um, these things like percolate into the inner European union.
2371.64 2382.78 SPEAKER_00  Um, and this is sort of like, I would say one of the stronger parts of the book is that like, you think this stuff is used on the periphery and then it's course, inevitably it's used in the Imperial core.
2382.78 2389.80 SPEAKER_00  Um, you know, the, the stuff gets used in, in, in Kashmir and Indians are like, uh, and then it's used all throughout India in the same way.
2390.18 2397.12 SPEAKER_00  Uh, you have Israeli, uh, technology that's being used in, uh, like in the Mediterranean is then used in Europe.
2397.20 2405.32 SPEAKER_00  Um, and so both Hungary and Bulgaria had this idea of getting the Israeli company that built the border walls.
2405.42 2411.30 SPEAKER_00  I say border, uh, the walls around like Gaza and the West bank to build like walls for them.
2411.38 2411.82 SPEAKER_00  Right.
2412.14 2419.80 SPEAKER_00  There's, there's this quote by Netanyahu a couple of years ago where he says, um, uh, they will become more like us than we will become like them.
2419.80 2420.26 SPEAKER_00  Right.
2420.36 2432.52 SPEAKER_00  So his, his vision of Europe is one that is being sort of like led by Israel into this place of, uh, sort of like recognition that, uh, it's constantly under siege from the barbarians.
2432.52 2432.76 SPEAKER_00  Right.
2433.22 2440.20 SPEAKER_01  This is the same thing to be also said of, uh, of the, uh, the, the border wall in the American, in Arizona.
2440.42 2440.88 SPEAKER_01  Right.
2440.94 2459.38 SPEAKER_01  You know, I, you say, talking about, of Elbit, a, uh, the oft protested Elbit, uh, it's most contentious project has been the building of a sophisticated surveillance system and towers worth 20, 218 million American dollars across 62 miles of the native American land in, uh, Arizona and the Mexican state of Sonora.
2459.38 2466.46 SPEAKER_01  Well, some indigenous leaders improved to the plan, arguing that implementation of the Elbit plan would reduce the need for a physical border being built across their territory.
2467.20 2474.30 SPEAKER_01  Uh, other locals oppose this border wall, including, uh, Ophelia Rivas, who told me of her lands being scarred by the Elbit construction site.
2474.62 2480.64 SPEAKER_01  You know, and it's the, uh, they say the intercept, uh, quoted again in the book, attended an Elbit live demonstration in Arizona.
2480.64 2485.52 SPEAKER_01  It was shown how the system was designed to operate using a command and control design built originally for the IDF.
2485.52 2491.36 SPEAKER_01  The company displayed its ability in the day and the night using either long range infrared cameras or laser illuminators.
2491.36 2507.28 SPEAKER_01  The post 9 11 environment across the U S Mexico border was a rapid acceleration of a military style state where migrants and native Americans were constantly framed as threats to be managed and harassed, leading to a record number of migrants dying between 2021 and 2022 along the U S Mexico border.
2507.84 2529.68 SPEAKER_01  And then goes again about goes into the similarities between the U S treatment of its own southern border and, um, Israel's treatment of its, uh, sort of, um, uh, walls, again, along its occupied territories and how those are essentially growing, you know, and whether that, and so we talk about again about like the, you say we will make them more like us.
2529.68 2534.86 SPEAKER_01  I mean, in, in this case, yeah, it's like by sell, by beat, by showing you the willing, right.
2534.86 2535.48 SPEAKER_01  To do this.
2535.48 2541.52 SPEAKER_01  Cause an American company and Earl has also promised to basically do the same thing, create a kind of virtual border wall.
2541.52 2546.76 SPEAKER_01  I guess the L bit sales pitch here is again, we have already done something like this.
2546.82 2551.18 SPEAKER_01  We were willing to do it and look, civil society stayed basically.
2551.52 2572.70 SPEAKER_00  You, you, you take sort of October 7th in this analysis as, uh, globally kind of speed bump, but also, um, like a failure of marketing for these Israeli companies that sort of, uh, sell this idea of securitization and compliance and, uh, you know, pushing things under the rug.
2573.48 2576.68 SPEAKER_00  And, you know, I think you can still take this very pessimistic view.
2576.78 2583.08 SPEAKER_00  I think in total, you can still believe that like the world is going to get more like this.
2583.20 2596.78 SPEAKER_00  I, I appreciate the fact that the book, uh, links, you know, borders in the Mediterranean, borders in Arizona, um, sort of occupied territories in, in Kashmir, uh, genocide and ethnic cleansing in Xinjiang.
2596.78 2601.36 SPEAKER_00  Uh, all of these, uh, sort of like they exist in an ecosystem.
2601.54 2611.36 SPEAKER_00  Israel is one player in it and Israel is able to use, or has been able to use Palestine as a sort of like marketing tool more than anything else there.
2611.46 2618.10 SPEAKER_00  It's, it's less so much about doing actual R and D so much as it's about this image of toughness.
2618.10 2631.18 SPEAKER_00  And I think the, one of the useful things about having the kind of like history of Israeli arms deals, um, at the sort of like front half of the book is to say that like, you didn't need to be able to pack people's phones to do this.
2631.48 2633.20 SPEAKER_00  It's like, it's the same thing.
2633.26 2634.12 SPEAKER_00  It always has been.
2634.38 2639.52 SPEAKER_00  And it's the same thing that like all States do just with like an air of unsubtlety about it.
2639.70 2641.64 SPEAKER_00  I have a few problems with this book, right?
2641.74 2652.92 SPEAKER_00  And yes, so I think I'll get to tone and style later, but in, in terms of structure, like I said, I don't think a lot of this is revelatory, right?
2652.94 2655.56 SPEAKER_00  If you, it's, it's useful information.
2655.70 2663.50 SPEAKER_00  It's collated usefully in one place, but it's not anything that I think is really going to shock you.
2663.50 2678.22 SPEAKER_00  If you know about Israel or if you just know about States, like if you like, I don't know many American BDS activists, who would be shocked at the idea that Israel was spying on them, or was trying to get into their phones, for instance.
2678.82 2694.98 SPEAKER_00  I think the extent to which it's sort of like, likewise, if you're a Mexican journalist, the fact that the, you know, spyware on your phone was made in Israel and sold to the Mexican government by Israel is like, interesting, but I don't think determinative.
2695.40 2698.00 SPEAKER_00  The Mexican government wants that spyware in it.
2698.18 2698.46 SPEAKER_00  Absolutely.
2698.58 2701.24 SPEAKER_01  If it doesn't buy it from the cartelized elements,
2701.24 2705.60 SPEAKER_00  we'll have to read Oscars of Alistair. Drug cartels do not exist at some point.
2705.98 2710.68 SPEAKER_00  But yeah, if it, there are lots of sellers in that market.
2710.68 2713.20 SPEAKER_00  And if you don't want to buy it from Israel, you can buy it from China.
2713.32 2715.28 SPEAKER_00  You can buy it from the U S you can buy it from the UK.
2715.28 2716.78 SPEAKER_00  You can buy it from France, wherever.
2717.28 2718.42 SPEAKER_01  Israel's you know what it is.
2718.48 2719.44 SPEAKER_01  It's buying it from Israel.
2719.50 2723.20 SPEAKER_01  It's a bit like buying it from a gun show, like buying a gun from a gun show in the States.
2723.34 2725.74 SPEAKER_01  There are a few fewer performative checks you have to go.
2725.88 2726.32 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, exactly.
2726.48 2734.68 SPEAKER_00  And you, you might get like a vacation in Israel where you can go and see Yad Vashem and a sort of like glaring display of hypocrisy or whatever.
2734.68 2747.14 SPEAKER_00  In general too, I think the book identifies the sort of like the politics of Israel as becoming more right wing, right?
2747.28 2753.52 SPEAKER_00  As, as sort of like, but it identifies it as like something that's being driven by the U S as well.
2753.74 2764.06 SPEAKER_00  For instance, I have a quote here, Jerusalem post editor in chief, Yaakov Katz, head of a pro settler media outlet admitted in 2022, that a significant percentage of Israel has taken a turn to the far right.
2764.42 2767.80 SPEAKER_00  They use terminology borrowed from white supremacists in the U S.
2768.18 2773.04 SPEAKER_00  It was an extraordinary admission, led to few suggestions by the paper beyond pushing for better education.
2773.64 2778.32 SPEAKER_00  And then we, we see the sort of effects of this in a 2016 poll conducted by Pew Research Center.
2778.40 2784.84 SPEAKER_00  And this is all of course like years pre October 7th, nearly half of Israeli Jews supported the transfer or expulsion of Arabs.
2785.16 2789.08 SPEAKER_00  Some 60% of Israeli Jews backed complete separation from Arabs.
2789.08 2799.34 SPEAKER_00  According to a study in 2022 by the Israeli democracy Institute, the majority of Israeli Jews polled online in 2022 supported the expulsion of people accused of disloyalty to the state.
2799.74 2821.72 SPEAKER_00  And so it has these two pieces in its mind from, from the history part in the beginning, which identifies that like Israel has these strange centralized holdovers where like a lot of it is a sort of thin glass of democracy over like sort of 40s and 50s, like autocracy, like to the point that, you know, anything published in Israel goes through the IDF center.
2821.84 2831.22 SPEAKER_00  That's a fact that like a lot of people do not think of when they think about Israel or the only democracy in the Middle East is like, Oh, there's a military center who approves everything for publication.
2831.22 2832.92 SPEAKER_00  It has that in one part.
2833.00 2845.76 SPEAKER_00  And then it has the kind of like sort of global right wing interconnectedness of guys, you know, determining each other's language and determining each other's affects and being like, are you triggered?
2845.94 2855.28 SPEAKER_00  And extending that from like Israel to the U S to, to India, um, you know, and all of the sort of like Indian reply guys, uh, who are like pro BJP, pro Hindu.
2855.28 2859.24 SPEAKER_00  And it, it never really like synthesizes those.
2859.50 2861.22 SPEAKER_01  Kashmir is laboratory too, sir.
2861.76 2862.24 SPEAKER_00  Legitimately.
2862.38 2863.02 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, absolutely.
2863.26 2867.22 SPEAKER_00  Like, um, there's, I think there's particularly, there's a detail about Kashmir.
2867.34 2876.60 SPEAKER_00  There's, he cites a Kashmiri author, Paré, uh, who writes in his book, Cups of Nunchai, our current masters do not even want to exploit us.
2876.90 2881.92 SPEAKER_00  They would rather we cease to exist so that they can have an empty land to fill with their fantasies of paradise.
2881.92 2888.28 SPEAKER_00  And so you, you have this sort of like a global right wing tide that encompasses all of that and Hungary and Romania and all of this.
2888.84 2893.74 SPEAKER_00  And then I, I don't know, it just kind of notes it figures.
2894.04 2898.94 SPEAKER_00  This is going to get worse forever in a sort of perfectly seamless way.
2899.34 2901.42 SPEAKER_00  Uh, and therefore you should be worried about it.
2901.46 2910.68 SPEAKER_00  And I think there's a particular kind of tone about this where it stops one step short of its conclusion.
2910.86 2911.30 SPEAKER_00  Right.
2911.30 2918.40 SPEAKER_00  And I think a lot of this, it, it, as a book, I, I don't mean to call out Verso specifically as a publisher here, right?
2918.42 2932.52 SPEAKER_00  Because they're not the, the only ones doing it, but there is, there are a lot of books that are of a kind published by Verso where you have a kind of like left wing analysis, uh, and you say a bunch of things which are correct, like observably correct.
2932.62 2934.84 SPEAKER_00  And you do some, a little bit of analysis about them.
2934.86 2936.08 SPEAKER_00  And then you go, there you go.
2936.14 2936.68 SPEAKER_00  That's your book.
2936.94 2938.44 SPEAKER_00  Um, the bad things are bad.
2938.44 2939.68 SPEAKER_00  The bad things are bad.
2939.78 2943.36 SPEAKER_01  Here is how exactly how it works in pretty forensic detail.
2943.36 2952.10 SPEAKER_00  The global and shitification, uh, and, and, you know, the thing is, it's kind of, it, it frustrates me, right?
2952.14 2955.40 SPEAKER_00  Because there's kind of two genders here, right?
2955.44 2962.88 SPEAKER_00  You have the like, quite serious, like, Verso type book of, here's how, uh, everything is fucked.
2963.32 2976.46 SPEAKER_00  And then you have the kind of like popular thing, which is the, you tend to see in like mainstream bookstores of here's how the world is fucked and how to fix it by, you know, disgraced ex prime minister, longtime columnist, whatever.
2976.66 2982.18 SPEAKER_00  And, and they're sort of like, they have the prerogative or the kind of like comfortableness with, with speculation.
2982.70 2987.88 SPEAKER_00  Whereas a lot of this kind of thing goes, it's probably going to stay bad forever.
2988.36 2989.94 SPEAKER_00  This is why I love the left, right?
2989.94 2999.88 SPEAKER_00  Um, uh, and it just kind of, in particular in this book as well, there's a kind of, I don't think it knows what tone it wants to adopt.
3000.00 3004.46 SPEAKER_00  There are a couple of moments where it takes on a kind of like narrative flourish.
3004.84 3013.48 SPEAKER_00  And then it goes back to being this kind of like, you know, this, this essay, this white paper about how, um, not even a white paper because it has no policy proposals.
3013.84 3021.06 SPEAKER_00  Uh, but it goes back to being this essay about how, um, Israel sort of like uses Palestine as a, testing ground and marketing gimmick.
3021.16 3025.46 SPEAKER_00  And it's like, I vastly preferred the attempt at narrative.
3025.46 3036.48 SPEAKER_00  You know, I've, I've vastly referred to like make characters of these people, uh, to like string these things together, uh, in a more sort of like a more compelling way.
3036.54 3037.76 SPEAKER_00  And it just kind of abandons them.
3037.86 3046.98 SPEAKER_00  And I, I really wish that it had had taken on sort of more of that because I think the better kinds of book of this mode does do that.
3047.24 3051.10 SPEAKER_00  You know, it develops into a narrative rather than a list.
3051.22 3052.76 SPEAKER_00  Well, it's something that could be expressed as a list.
3052.76 3053.54 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, absolutely.
3053.94 3059.66 SPEAKER_00  Uh, this, it's kind of, this felt encyclopedic for better and worse, you know?
3059.74 3063.40 SPEAKER_00  And I, I, I think that's a source of frustration to me.
3063.50 3070.96 SPEAKER_00  And then it, it's kind of, it's the limits of its worldview as well, which I think we've, we've just seen sort of very violently exposed.
3071.10 3071.46 SPEAKER_00  Right.
3071.80 3073.78 SPEAKER_00  And I would be curious.
3073.86 3075.36 SPEAKER_00  I think this is a useful building block.
3075.36 3096.00 SPEAKER_00  I am glad that I read it, but I, again, I think in terms of ways of thinking about Israel, uh, and ways of thinking about what Israel means for the global sort of like pull towards fascism, uh, and, and occupation and dispossession and brutality, barbarism, then I, I don't know.
3096.04 3097.86 SPEAKER_00  I, I, I wanted more from it.
3098.28 3098.32 SPEAKER_00  Indeed.
3098.44 3098.68 SPEAKER_00  Well,
3099.20 3103.88 SPEAKER_01  uh, Anthony Lowenstein, when you write the sequel, uh, but I, I do.
3104.06 3104.32 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3104.42 3104.90 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3104.90 3105.84 SPEAKER_01  I do think right.
3105.88 3109.36 SPEAKER_01  That this is, I go back to sort of who's the audience for it.
3109.62 3110.06 SPEAKER_01  Right.
3110.48 3119.00 SPEAKER_01  Where if you're reading it, this will not, basically anyone who would read this book would not be surprised by any of its contents.
3119.28 3120.04 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, absolutely.
3120.12 3124.66 SPEAKER_00  I think that that's precisely what I mean when I'm, when I'm fucking making fun of Verso, right.
3124.66 3130.48 SPEAKER_00  Is that it is exactly that is books of people who are not going to be surprised by what they find in them, you know?
3130.78 3141.68 SPEAKER_01  And, you know, that's where things like storytelling come in, because the facts will not themselves be surprising, but the storytelling can bring some new way to relate them to other people.
3141.78 3145.36 SPEAKER_01  And that's the innovation as opposed to the forensicness with which they're compiled.
3145.36 3146.04 SPEAKER_01  Again,
3146.44 3159.06 SPEAKER_00  I think one of the things that really sets out like great writing or great journalism in this mode is a sense of the weird. For a country as weird as Israel is, you only get a couple of glimmers of that.
3159.18 3167.78 SPEAKER_00  Like Benny Gantz being like, yeah, we should just buy Coase, I guess, is, is, is like a profoundly weird detail that goes completely unexplored.
3168.30 3171.74 SPEAKER_00  And I, yeah, it just, it, it's businesslike.
3171.98 3175.74 SPEAKER_00  The soda tax, the, the, the database of gay Mexicans, right?
3175.98 3176.96 SPEAKER_00  Completely unexplored.
3177.32 3177.74 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3178.20 3192.60 SPEAKER_01  Well, I guess this comes, this comes back to some, I think something that we go back to again and again in the mainline podcast, as it were, which is that one of the striking things about the people who are trying to do weird things is the fucking weird things they're trying to do.
3192.80 3193.32 SPEAKER_00  It's surreal.
3193.56 3203.52 SPEAKER_01  It's, uh, you know, but, but in trying to create a kind of, uh, forensically argued encyclopedia, you sort of end up flattening all of the strange.
3203.66 3204.14 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, absolutely.
3204.30 3214.48 SPEAKER_00  I mean, it fucking John Forster, one of the apartheid prime ministers of South Africa was invited to Yad Vashem, the, the like Israeli Holocaust memorial.
3214.50 3225.72 SPEAKER_00  Um, and during the war, he had been a member of a fascist pro Nazi Afrikaner terrorist group, um, like quite openly.
3225.92 3233.84 SPEAKER_00  And you sort of think, what is a South African Nazi think going around Yad Vashem?
3234.20 3246.56 SPEAKER_00  And the answer is sort of not speculated upon because we just kind of talked to Ataimak about his, his sort of campaign to have Yad Vashem stop bringing people like that.
3247.02 3247.30 SPEAKER_00  You know,
3247.66 3254.76 SPEAKER_01  it goes back to one of the, uh, sort of when Trump came to visit Yad Vashem, so happy to be here with all my friends.
3254.86 3255.48 SPEAKER_00  Have a great summer.
3255.48 3265.10 SPEAKER_00  There's another really weird one too, which is, um, so he talks to a, a Colombian anti-communist militia leader, one of the most fascist guys on earth.
3265.34 3274.58 SPEAKER_00  Um, and, and he says in Spanish on TV, we've even been accused of being the Israelis of Latin America, which makes me feel really proud.
3275.02 3280.78 SPEAKER_00  And that's such a strange confluence of things for a South American fascist to be saying.
3281.72 3293.20 SPEAKER_00  That, I just, again, the construction of, uh, Israeli masculinity and Israeli violence and, you know, all of this is like, interesting.
3293.20 3297.78 SPEAKER_00  And then this is just kind of like a list of arms deals, you know,
3298.14 3303.54 SPEAKER_01  I guess, I guess it's, this is a call to verso to embrace the strangeness of the things that you cover.
3303.80 3304.24 SPEAKER_01  Legitimately.
3304.48 3304.70 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
3304.84 3311.04 SPEAKER_00  And honestly, like with the best will in the world, and it's, it's not like a personal criticism.
3311.04 3314.42 SPEAKER_00  I, I, I do think this needed like another edit.
3314.66 3324.70 SPEAKER_00  It, it just, it, I think it could have been so much more compelling, compellingly arranged, you know, and delivered, but what can you do?
3324.98 3326.90 SPEAKER_00  You know, please don't stop sending us books.
3326.98 3327.30 SPEAKER_01  Verso.
3327.60 3328.08 SPEAKER_01  Basically.
3328.88 3329.28 None  Yeah.
3329.36 3329.72 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3329.72 3330.16 SPEAKER_01  Come on.
3330.18 3334.46 SPEAKER_01  If you're working and you feel like, you're working at Verso, uh, forget, just forget you heard anything.
3334.76 3335.50 SPEAKER_01  Just walk away.
3336.12 3336.48 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3336.62 3337.20 SPEAKER_00  Just, just,
3337.34 3340.42 SPEAKER_01  I'm, uh, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm going to run here.
3340.74 3350.44 SPEAKER_01  Uh, so I think that's probably as good a place as any to leave it, but thank you very much for picking this for left on red and also for, I think, supplying many of the ideas.
3350.46 3350.92 SPEAKER_00  Thank you.
3350.98 3354.84 SPEAKER_00  I, it's, uh, I mean, thank you to the listener for, for joining us.
3355.24 3362.44 SPEAKER_00  Um, you're already on the Patreon, but the $10 tier on the Patreon, we, we do a second episode of left on right a month.
3363.10 3367.90 SPEAKER_01  Oh, the year was 1778.
