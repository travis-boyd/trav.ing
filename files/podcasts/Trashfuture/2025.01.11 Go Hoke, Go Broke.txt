0.00 63.38 SPEAKER_02  so i just think like if you're proto-indo-european jordan belfort and you want to do like a sales technique you could be like hey sell me this wheel which he would have called a interesting um which is related to there's another kind of well an indo-european word for wheel that's at the root of our world for our word for rotate and they were so into wagons that they had different words for different types of wheels that we don't even have we're so conceptually limited i got ripped off by the used wheel dealer that's what the phrase wheeler dealer comes yeah but if you were proto-indo-european jordan belfort and then you'd be like okay instead of selling this pen like sell me this wheel and it's like well you're gonna you're gonna have to come to my city on the edge of edge of the step grassland and how are you gonna do that without a wheel interesting interesting yeah that's
63.38 80.42 SPEAKER_03  right yeah and that's how they invented the unicycle it's it's entirely possible that the people who spoke proto-indo-european language were making business deals the likes of which we can only kind of like glimpse you know like oh yeah well this posits the existence of proto-indo-european trump
80.42 86.12 SPEAKER_01  yeah yeah we got a lot of words for wheel more more words than than anyone else actually

315.96 332.06 SPEAKER_03  it's terribly terribly unreliable yeah the the avanti tribe with two eyes at the end those guys they're really they're like a kind of like silk road state they're really exploiting their monopoly on the like geographic position between our two capitals yeah but it has it has created some
332.06 338.64 SPEAKER_02  incredible mosque construct like very beautiful intricate mosques yeah preston and like wigan
338.64 360.50 SPEAKER_03  northwest there's a beautiful blue tiled mosque because of this as a caravan of commuters are forced to like get off and wait and in preston for like four hours those people just kind of like had their like a caravanserai built around them and from that this like center of uh center of like
360.50 378.04 SPEAKER_02  islamic learning and theology yeah yeah there's actually a lot of greek knowledge was ancient greek knowledge was preserved in madrasas in preston that came up as a result of the silk road okay no we are we are jumping so far in time from step like because we're talking about step culture
378.04 395.28 SPEAKER_03  and like it's it's like a horrible like mutilation of history but that's fine that's what people will come to us for it doesn't matter this is the the first time that the phrase madrasa in preston has been used on a podcast that wasn't astoundingly racist that's right well you know what get ready
395.28 424.26 SPEAKER_02  for more of that uh because 2025 no more talk of uh step stuff because 2025 is the year of the step okay that's when we step-pilled that's what yeah i look i've been step-pilled for a while but i'm making it official no we are um we know what i'm doing this for actually is that google is starting to try to make its own podcast with ai and i want to confuse it as much as possible the more we can talk about this we're basically poisoning the training data set for google no this is tf i'm
424.26 445.88 SPEAKER_03  gonna get off step stuff for now i but the thing is i know i can pull you back easily you think you can sinusize yourself and you can you can kind of like settle down and forget your nomadic ways but like it turns out that actually any serious domestic political challenge is gonna like show that you've built your house on sand and you're gonna have to sort of like restore the
445.88 477.10 SPEAKER_02  the sort of like step way of living sorry are you suggesting and i'm let me to phrase this very carefully are you suggesting that nomadic horse rider takes uh ancient bureaucratic exam in perfect chinese and shocks han majority really good yeah horse milk in perfect chinese that's right all right no no we're uh we're we're doing we're doing tf now uh i mean god protect patrick wyman when he comes back on i mean god protect
477.10 483.00 SPEAKER_04  patrick wyman in general oh yeah that guy's great yeah yeah not that he needs protection
483.00 520.92 SPEAKER_02  oh he's a big guy i want to start by revisiting an old friend volocopter uh just to remind everybody volocopter was a german air taxi company that was one of neom's strategic partners they were going to do all of the flying taxis that were going to make neom work and were pretty much i would say completely essential to all of the big sports plans that neom had yeah yeah yeah i remember volocopter sure volocopter obviously i just i haven't i haven't read this the articles come up i assume it's going to be volocopter the german air taxi developer backed by saudi arabia's neom giga project has gone from strength to strength yeah it's going to be things continue to be good
520.92 525.58 SPEAKER_04  because we hope that things are well as i say with neom would would go bust oh oh i'm sorry i'm
525.58 541.96 SPEAKER_02  sorry i'm i'm reading the rest of the article here i'm i can't believe i misled you like this volocopter the german air taxi developer backed by saudi arabia's neom giga project has filed for insolvency oh oh i am sorry to have misled you all you're telling me that running running this sort of
541.96 550.16 SPEAKER_03  like mooted flying taxis between like you know 2034 world cup stadia on a line wasn't a
550.16 557.50 SPEAKER_02  profitable business model on second examination it appears that no okay no it was not now a
557.50 561.78 SPEAKER_04  mass cut to a branch of samsonite in hamburg that have just sold a lot of suitcases
561.78 582.68 SPEAKER_03  yeah the entire volocopter stuff have all driven to the same airport getting out of one big mercedes like s600 like a clown car trying to flee the country yeah well they wouldn't want to go in one of their own craft have they even did they this is my question right did they make a single aircraft
582.68 598.18 SPEAKER_02  they so they were forced to scale back plans to ferry athletes and officials around paris during the olympics this summer uh as it was did they have to scale them back to zero so i'm getting here they they have they have piloted prototypes but they have never done a commercial flight okay so they
598.18 618.08 SPEAKER_03  they have made like one or two that exist and like fly around okay sure wait we scale back our plans from plans to not plan so it's like one time i'm looking at this thing now and it looks like biblically accurate helicopter um it's by some margin one of the dumbest things i've ever seen and you're telling
618.08 644.46 SPEAKER_02  me that again that this did not work yes i i need you to if you can just suspend your disbelief now also i know that we're all big fans of volocopter ceo dirk hoke on this podcast right yeah of course yeah we're all hoaxters you know you've got you've got no bob hope and dirt coke that's right we're we're all absolutely um hoke pilled we're dirk maxing yeah we actually the thing is you think the

884.84 901.42 SPEAKER_03  just get bought okay you know i mean are there any buyers out there are the saudis gonna come in and like auto rotate this failed startup is is that like because like neon like the line doesn't work without the stupid helicopter bullshit or the stupid train bullshit um you need that stuff to
901.42 907.02 SPEAKER_02  shuffle people between louis vuitton stores so but the saudis are worried about their own money
907.02 913.80 SPEAKER_04  situation at the moment so the saudis are not coming to the pub tonight they're actually they've
913.80 927.64 SPEAKER_02  overspent a bit this month yeah the saudis are waiting till payday until they're like the saudis are like like googling klarna yeah on the line three easy installments of 15 trillion dollars
927.64 947.04 SPEAKER_03  three easy installments of about 80 kilometers three to be real with you quite difficult installments these are gonna be some really challenging klarna just straight up leveling with you based on your like actual finances three pretty challenging installments yeah installments that are really
947.04 952.92 SPEAKER_04  gonna test like the laws of physics the migratory patterns of birds things of that nature we have some
952.92 963.70 SPEAKER_02  we have some more neom content for the end of this one actually okay because whoever it is who works at neom that just routinely leaks their documents to the wall street journal has done that again
963.70 980.22 SPEAKER_04  yeah someone who's impervious to being bone sword i presume yeah like wolverine yeah yeah yeah someone in a kind of like darth vader type situation before they've cut off like one arm already
980.22 987.00 SPEAKER_03  and then just like more and more but he keeps leaking documents yeah like a sort of bionic man yeah i i may
987.00 991.38 SPEAKER_02  leak a lot of blood from the bone size but i will never stop leaking documents to the wall street journal
991.38 997.02 SPEAKER_03  anyways the wall street journal kind of the war thunder forums of saudi arabia so i also want to
997.02 1029.16 SPEAKER_02  talk about another thing another government that like saudi arabia is out of ideas is gripped by a sort of sclerotic ruling class that's unable to let go of of power or reform itself really where there was quite an unexpected transformation of the country's politics in 2015 as well interesting of course i'm talking about britain because keir starmer that's where i your government yeah oh well after this segment you might want to be like oh no britain i want keir in the full arab garb i want
1029.16 1040.26 SPEAKER_04  mohammed bin starmer yeah we all that would be great imagine just keir starmer just turning up with that much drip one day and just never addressing it i mean charles does it right like he does the
1040.26 1045.70 SPEAKER_03  whole sword dance thing every time he goes to saudi arabia so yeah why not keir why not keir him and
1045.70 1049.88 SPEAKER_04  charles both doing a joint press conference both dressed like that both not addressing it
1049.88 1058.50 SPEAKER_03  you could convince about 20 of the british population minimum that that has already happened yeah
1058.50 1070.72 SPEAKER_02  the country has gone muslim we won't elaborate for because of the silk road because of those silk road mosques in preston so your government is practically brimming with ideas keir starmer how
1070.72 1075.28 SPEAKER_04  do you decide on the best one and this is your momentum your campaign is a momentum runaway freight
1075.28 1108.98 SPEAKER_02  train indeed that in an environment where i believe the last three quarters uh of the british economy were recorded as having like basically no or it's like negligible growth for a second i thought you meant we were down to the last three quarters of the british economy we've lost a whole quarter i mean last three courses in an american sense three yeah yeah and we're taking it all to the slot machine it actually does baffle me that it does baffle me that that was the official advice given to councils which provide the vast majority of the services that provide the living standards for
1108.98 1113.76 SPEAKER_03  the vast majority of people in the country is gamble yeah it's like i've just had a text from michael
1113.76 1125.08 SPEAKER_04  gov and it just says vegas baby but there's a there's a venn diagram overlap here between the financial plans of uk councils and the guy who's leaking all of the neon documents and it's one
1125.08 1170.92 SPEAKER_02  armed bandit so no but we we talked i think last episode and i actually can't remember about how there is no plan and there never was a plan like how starmer walked into number 10 and there was no plan reeves had no plan all they had a plan to do was to be the other team when the first team fell apart and get elected in a majority of three people given that there was no plan for growth other than just really try if you can cut taxes and cut and cut regulations the right way the smart way as the responsible managers rather than the sort of reckless tories it would the foundations of the british neoliberalism would just get fixed so this is the um this was reported uh at the end of last year the prime minister the chancellor and the business secretary jonathan reynolds have written to watch dogs including off gem the fca and the cma to demand that they all come up with a plan for growth
1170.92 1187.16 SPEAKER_04  oh i'm glad someone's gonna do it you know yeah like it feels like it's been a minute yeah he might as well have included the xl bullies why not fuck it let's get all the dogs involved we've not got any ideas why don't you have a go you know what people love is a quango so all of these uh sort of
1187.16 1193.36 SPEAKER_02  regulators have been asked to submit plans to finally get the uk economy growing and they're they're due in
1193.36 1204.04 SPEAKER_03  the middle of january they each need to come up with like a no bad ideas go around the room somebody because somebody's got to have like a wild kind of plan to get us out of this spot we're in type
1204.04 1215.32 SPEAKER_04  thing yes everyone these these are like the fucking the different frat houses now like off gem they're all in like togas and they're like fuck stormer wants the assignment tomorrow he's gonna close off
1215.32 1240.12 SPEAKER_02  gem if we don't come up with a plan for growth dude fuck we have to we have to stop this kegger waking up a guy who's passed out but just in the most bureaucratic suit you could imagine we gotta get the the cmas we gotta get the nerds on this one anyway so the letter to watch the the all the watchdogs and a wider drive for regulatory form is the is the brainchild of course of who else but
1240.12 1257.12 SPEAKER_03  varun chandra from hakloit oh the the the guy from the like intelligence services linked think tank the very same yes cool the guy who definitely doesn't work for mi6 anymore that's the best that like mi6's alumni could come up with was all right let's go around the room no stupid ideas
1257.12 1263.50 SPEAKER_02  uh bake sale what what if what if the country puts on a car wash
1263.50 1282.70 SPEAKER_04  charity car wash what do you think with mi6 to be fair never had that many ideas like you know 50 years ago just been like well we've tried all being in the closet and mostly just giving information to the russians that didn't really help there may be a bake sale better probably better
1282.70 1319.28 SPEAKER_02  than just giving it all to the russians you got to believe in something george something beautiful so one regulatory source this weekend said it was from varun chandra the letter urged regulators to identify how government could remove barriers to economic growth where regulatory objectives were getting in the way and that the watchdogs were expected to supply their five-point plans each of them has to do a five-point plan uh-huh of what how i got the economy growing this summer by the competition and markets authority oh it's a little icebreaker yeah uh now that's they're supposed to submit those plans by mid-january so i'm i am itching to see exactly what they come up with six days
1319.28 1325.06 SPEAKER_04  left boys well five days when this comes out six days at the time of recording they do group projects
1325.06 1331.56 SPEAKER_03  the same way i do just panic just leave it and just kind of wait until you know there's a week to go
1331.56 1348.54 SPEAKER_04  i just just put some shit in a google doc it'll be fine i hate being the guy at the competition and markets authority who's actually been doing all the work on the how to get the economy growing project and then everyone else is just going to come in at the last minute and put their name on it that's the guy who runs britain that that's that's yeah everyone else comes in and is like oh no i'm
1348.54 1359.12 SPEAKER_02  char i'm in charge of decorating like the foam core board i i put on like the pipe cleaners sparkles you know how complicated competition and markets are we're a regular we're not supposed to
1359.12 1364.30 SPEAKER_04  be involved in getting the economy great it's not in our purview i've spent 10 hours compiling this
1364.30 1397.02 SPEAKER_02  document it doesn't even make any sense yeah i've spent 10 hours compiling this document and sticking it onto a diorama yeah that's right now so but basically right this is part of my uh ongoing there's no plan watch the final watchdog the secret one yeah well that's that's me i guess and how the sort of no one has any ideas and the best idea they can have as you say november is let's just go around the room no bad ideas and this is being the reason i'm talking about this now this is being done against the background of i would say another possibly brewing economic crisis in the uk
1397.02 1402.66 SPEAKER_03  oh good it was about time we have one of those because things have been so quiet and sort of like
1402.66 1406.94 SPEAKER_04  you know relaxed otherwise yeah stuff's going good i think we could do with being taken down a few
1406.94 1470.00 SPEAKER_02  pecs actually yeah so the basically what has happened is that the pound has fallen to a and by the way i say possible economic crisis because when these things are sort of in their incipient stages they can be seen off for a little while right but the factors that cause them to keep coming back aren't getting fixed so i'm not saying this is going to then roll into an economic crisis i'm saying this is an example of the kinds of underlying factors that cause economic crises threatening to cause one yeah yeah it might have an opportunistic infection kind of yes gotcha yeah exactly and we're also just like we have an opportunistic infection and we have like a jehovah's witnesses attitude towards like antibiotics and blood transfusions uh-huh so the pound has fallen to a 14 month low against the dollar and 10-year bond yields are around where they were when liz trust did the mini budget right and we're not even going to get any birthday money because of jehovah's witnesses that's fucked oh okay all right i guess we i said we said no bad ideas but i guess we can take off birthday money from the plan i'm jehovah's witness keir starmer and i do have a plan which is
1470.00 1493.92 SPEAKER_04  that we need to accelerate the coming of the rapture i think if i negotiate properly we can get everyone in in the uk into the chosen ones who get to go into heaven immediately and then there will no longer be a need to run the uk economy it's the best i can do i'm talking to him tomorrow to talk about bringing forward the date i i talk to him every night okay summer and god in bed in little nightcap
1493.92 1507.68 SPEAKER_02  yeah so um yeah and the 30-year bond yields in the uk are now at the highest level since 1998 when russia defaulted oh we're not gonna worry about that for 30 years come on uh so basically like just a
1507.68 1534.68 SPEAKER_03  a brief explainer please because every time we do a kind of like very financial very economic story on this podcast i always feel like an oaf and i'm like so if you could like what does this mean why is this happening uh and and what could be done about it and ideally it's like a shorter format as possible because i've got subway surfers open um and also listening to like the quran translated to chinese at two times speed in this year so in terms of a burger yeah okay so imagine the uk
1534.68 1624.94 SPEAKER_02  is a tribe of i don't know let me just grab something out of the air nomadic horsemen in the pontic caspians no no i'll explain it briefly right basically if the bond yield is up right the currency also should be up then the bond yield goes up because there's like bonds tend to be sold at auctions and so they'd be like will anyone take it at one percent how about two percent three percent and then like the the yields go up because people wait to then be like okay yeah i'll invest in uk government debt right and so when the yields go up because investors need yield like they need they'd be given back percentages of things and the currency should go up because then you should buy pounds to buy british bonds yeah and the higher the yield on your government debt the more generally fucked you are because it means the other people are like no but then it's those guys somehow sometimes these things like like balance out because if your yield goes high but people but investors basically think that your country is credit worthy then they'll be like oh what a great opportunity i can get some good yield that i'm that will be paid back and then they buy it and then the value of your currency goes up and then you're more and then if you're import dependent you can import more things more efficiently these things tend to be in balance and so when they go out of balance when the yield goes up and the currency gets less valuable it's like we're not even able to get people being like oh yeah that's i think that's a good investment because we we're not even we're not able to induce them to invest in us at the moment to put this in context italy and spain are seen as more credit worthy than the uk oh uh-huh oh good yes so well to be fair those guys really have their shit
1624.94 1629.72 SPEAKER_04  together i mean i can't see i mean they're hard to compete with in the financial stakes yeah so
1629.72 1657.48 SPEAKER_02  and you know and all of this is to say right that it's easy like lots of people are trying to make different kinds of political hay out of this but they're trying to be like oh this is it's the exact same things are happening under you know like under the current government that were happening under trust and i don't want to spend too long on it but it's like what what trust did was she like freaked out all the bond investors who then ran away what's happening here is there's just kind of there's sort of no reason to be involved with us i guess is one of the best things
1657.48 1661.26 SPEAKER_03  you could say instead of giving bond traders anxiety we've given them depression
1661.26 1675.62 SPEAKER_00  liz trust sort of freaked them out with her kink they couldn't match her freak but with star where it's just like oh this man has this man has no freak at all this is not even like it wouldn't even be a vanilla situation it would be like awkward handshake at best he's never soiled a
1675.62 1693.70 SPEAKER_04  bath not even in his student days yeah yeah his arm is going to be like investors prefer spade well let's let's see about that because i'm going to catch spade off guard between the hours of 1 and 3 p.m yeah let's see how safe an investment spade is yeah and so i get basically without like
1693.70 1735.84 SPEAKER_02  trying to sort of completely drain this concept what you're looking at is just from the perspective of the financial managers of the economy is you're looking at within the fiscal rules that labor has set out that they're unwilling to break all of the spending that they wanted to do they now can't in fact they're going to have to do cuts real terms cuts oh more of those fantastic the treasury this is from the ft the treasury sought to reassure markets by stressing the government's commitment to its fiscal rules and ensuring stable public finances quote no one should be under any doubt that meeting the fiscal rules is non-negotiable and the government will have an iron grip on public finances and i don't know of any other country that does this by the way like there are very few other countries that do this they're so committed to giving like international bond vigilantes
1735.84 1745.70 SPEAKER_04  whatever they want all the time yeah it's like this and smack bomb p wet are like the two things that other countries do not do under any circumstances maybe well maybe that'll be one of the ideas that
1745.70 1756.54 SPEAKER_00  like is given at the round table like a new version of the smack bomb p wet it's like oh has anyone has anyone considered putting like the grease batter onto a potato and would that be a
1756.54 1768.40 SPEAKER_04  thing would that be like popular would people buy i would like to invite the bond investors to have a wig and kebab i'll say there's lots to invest in in the uk you know we are straightjacketed into
1768.40 1792.44 SPEAKER_02  this baffling set of fiscal rules that basically all it does i mean look i go i go back to this thing right where i say that the what people look for from a government what people have been looking for from a government is to say look there's a very scary economic world out there and again what people especially in like in developed countries and like the global north say is i want you my government to shield me your voting public from the global economy yeah the government should be riley
1792.44 1798.24 SPEAKER_04  and and then the public of the rest of us yeah i guess yes essentially we're like explain it to me in
1798.24 1845.68 SPEAKER_02  terms of burger yes yeah and but we have this thing where the ft uh alphaville said it very well that we have this set of fiscal rules that has the practical effect of reifying global market moves into your local hospital getting turned into a port-a-cabin phase yeah that's good and this is this it's been like this forever right austerity says that you know um the global financial crisis was caused by too many libraries in wolverhampton right that was that logic is that you know we we must do whatever the market says immediately uh and be very reactive to it and what that caused us to do is to stop ever investing in in this country which meant that like the things like steel plants in port talbot which meant that like um car manufacturers which meant all of these things that we were making and then exporting or making and then not having to import stuff stopped happening
1845.68 1859.44 SPEAKER_01  well that was the problem in wolverhampton we all got addicted to reading because of all the libraries and then the more that we read eventually we ran out of books and we had to start reading the the manifestos for cdo's and then and then it brought the whole thing down really because
1859.44 1917.02 SPEAKER_00  well these don't look very good it's so cool that like i spent at least half of my primary school life in a port-a-cabin like half of my primary school education took place in a port-a-cabin and now like i've started like i'm starting to like look for schools for like our kid because he's got to like go to like nursery next year and like three of them in our area of six or seven are in port-a-cabins so it's like not unrealistic that his school's like learning will also take place in a port-a-cabin and it's just like i don't know it's in in one way like bonds me to him in the sense of like oh we both have sort of experienced this very unique aspect of like british misery in this building that we're in this sort of like unit that is supposed to be temporary but nevertheless has come to sort of like define most aspects of like engaging with the british state at like the most basic level um and that's just it for like perpetuity yeah why don't we build the whole country out of the well why don't we make housing out of port-a-cabins why don't we like turn churches into port like make churches out of port-a-cabins i don't know like why you know why not just go well why not just fully
1917.02 1936.84 SPEAKER_04  port-a-cabin mac i've been reading a book about the successes of the eurasian step back it's given me an idea okay what if stately port-a-cabin we moved everything into port-a-cabins because what is the port-a-cabin but the modern version of the yurt it worked for the step nomad it could work for us
1936.84 1984.80 SPEAKER_02  and i mean i i guess i don't want to go too much as well into like bonds right uh but ultimately i'd say like the it's this is um the chief investment strategist at russell investments go andrew peace said andrew andrew uh smack barn paywet said it's a global sell-off but being compounded in the uk by a toxic combination of a flatlining economy sticky inflation and a worsening fiscal outlook just means growth isn't coming inflation is staying high and the way to manage that right is we are sticking with the thing that got us there because again i'll being brief with this if you basically cut all of your investment and spending and everything in response to you're not having much growth what that is going to do is it's going to mean you're going to have less growth in the future you are essentially slowly eating your own body yeah for calories are
1984.80 1991.28 SPEAKER_03  you suggesting that the the united kingdom is in ketosis i think the united kingdom is has long been
1991.28 1996.86 SPEAKER_02  out of ketosis and is now like sucking on the marrow of its own detached femur yeah delicious
1996.86 2008.52 SPEAKER_04  we like that guy in uh that guy in tasmania who broke out of jail in the 19th century and ate all the guys he escaped with but if he escaped alone but remained equally hungry just ate himself yeah i
2008.52 2120.14 SPEAKER_02  mean look and partly is right is that the role as i said like the role of governments in like the developed world global north is keep my living standards at a certain minimal acceptable level regardless of what the global economy is doing right sure and you know the the sort of the the plan of what's been slowly happening to the british economy in 40 years is that the amount of people who that gets done for is less and less and less and less often a lot of the protection will be provided through like an employer like in terms of private health care whatever whatever right that gets less and less and so standards of living are getting less and less protected for more and more people the governments are been as we've said over and over it's worth repeating in the face of this crisis that it's the same thing it's not new it's that the political dimension of the financial problem is that the government is being asked by its constituents to please keep living standards at an acceptable level at least for enough people that they maintain faith in this system while at the same time being perfectly reactive to bond markets by eating itself so you can see how this is crashing like the and what we're seeing now in like i want to say what we're seeing now in bond markets like this isn't a podcast that started with six minutes of hooting about like the proto-indo-europeans but what you're seeing now in financial markets is a symptom of that and what you're seeing in like just political like implosion is a symptom of that it's a symptom of we are basically being unwilling and unable to manage the impact of the global economy of living standards in the united kingdom and not caring and you know the all of the and again and again we say who's complicit in that the press is absolutely complicit in that right because the press are the people who are saying well what we're gonna do is we're gonna have another grooming gangs argument what we're gonna do is we're going to you know seriously wonder about like oh you know if andrew tate's got a new political party so he's gonna of course have to go on question time and if not him it's gonna be like someone else
2120.14 2125.22 SPEAKER_04  we're gonna have a full employment economy yeah everyone's gonna be a pedophile hunter
2125.22 2172.62 SPEAKER_02  and then that'll stimulate the economy so you know how do you keep high standards of living politic which is politically necessary without investment when without exporting anything largely off the back of city financial services which are you know as in a world that i would posit is a little bit less borderless right in a world that where like the instead of being one big canvas of a sort of a borderless network of trade it's now maybe a few separate canvases where like that model that we've built ourselves perfectly to be the manager of an economic model that is kind of fading and is sort of mostly faded actually and now we don't do or make much else one of our last best exports was higher education and we sort of blew that up on purpose oh yeah well because it went woke it well it went woke but also it went woke but also
2172.62 2176.56 SPEAKER_04  cockney rhyming slang for woke it's all fucking dirk in here
2176.56 2209.34 SPEAKER_02  yeah you know it's like so the fact is right like the reason the current plan for growth involves phoning around off what and asking if they have any bright ideas is because there is no solution to this that doesn't involve making changes that everybody on top finds unpalatable so you know it was never possible it was not possible to maintain high uk living standards or at least high enough for enough people that your political system stays broadly thought of as legitimate without providing a reason to the rest of the global economy for them to be high that meant investment
2209.34 2359.50 SPEAKER_00  it's probably also worth noting but like this isn't a new phenomenon by any means like the sort of stagnation in turn like in sort of the ability to produce stuff and the ability to like make stuff has sort of like we've been sort of stagnant for decades but it's largely been masked by surging asset prices and like i don't know it's like the manipulation of many people into believing they were a lot more wealthy than they were because they were living in bricks and mortar that were like you know worth way more like way way more than like it should be and you know in doing so like you know the justifications for austerity of the justifications for like selling off assets for you know which is still kind of being used is very much built and like it was very much sort of fermented at a time when you know you could manipulate a lot of people into thinking that they were you know very well off and you like that the government was providing as you mentioned like you know the minimum amount needed to sort of like convince them that they were being looked after and that they lived in the first world country and the fact that like all these walls are now falling and like the british government successive british governments just haven't even been willing to admit that and now like the current labor government like has no choice but to sort of confront it but they are you know epistemologically unprepared for like what to do next and so they look like headless chickens in part because they don't actually they cannot imagine anything else and but they also can't manipulate people into thinking that like they're actually better off than they are so it's sort of like it's kind of bizarre it's really amusing to watch it's really bizarre to watch as well but it's also just like ah we kind of know where this goes and it's not to sort of say that like any of the populist alternatives are going to like solve this problem because like you know like reform or whatever like also don't really have any like solutions to this problem other than like we're going to try do what liz trusted again so it's quite interesting more racist exactly but it's what i mean like the conservative party are basically trying to do that right now anyway i feel like the sort of ramping up of racism is really like you know what like when you were sort of talking about like you know all the stuff to do with like grooming gangs and just like me andrew tate stuff and just all these sort of distractions and the fact that like the political class have become really much more like indulgent in that and part of that is driven by like a sense of you know it's sort of capturing kind of a political economy well like a sort of political situation where um no one can really pay attention for longer than a few minutes but the second like the much broader issue is that like well none of them are really sort of willing to confront like the structural problems of what is actually going on or the structural challenges about what is going on and in doing so like what would be the only way then that you can really enact politics is through this type of like bizarre like you know all these sort of like bizarre kind of discussions or debates that really serve well you spectacle that really like serve more
2359.50 2388.96 SPEAKER_02  as entertainment than like anything material yeah and you know this this that that just get every day that gets sharper and sharper and sharper and sharper by the way what i want to go off something you mentioned about um asset values just to hop over to the u.s for just a moment is you're not going to be able to insure like a house in los angeles anymore oh yeah that's good you're not but you're you're not able to insure houses also in like florida now like home insurance is getting like dropped for huge majorities of people in disaster prone areas in the states which is getting to be quite a bit of
2388.96 2399.40 SPEAKER_04  the states and so again that we're like battling like kind of like the financial apocalypse and the u.s is battling like the actual apocalypse like the plagues of egypt happening to them i i mean yeah
2399.40 2420.54 SPEAKER_02  so the other thing right is what what happens there when again the foundations of your economy which is property owning democracy where the everyone's retirement plan is the idea that your house is going to be worth more than you paid for it right but what happens when those houses are uninsurable and so you can't get mortgages on them so you can't sell them what happens then i wouldn't worry i mean
2420.54 2431.88 SPEAKER_00  you're going to create more luigis probably a bowser a bowser probably will sort of show up at some point there'll be a lot of like loose like tortoise shells like in the debris of los angeles yeah i mean this
2431.88 2486.06 SPEAKER_02  is something that we we talked about before you were back hussein like yeah that is just what's going to happen there are going to be a lot more people who have a lot of very incoherent quite enervating beliefs who are going to take matters into their own hands luigi mortgage homie yeah that's right you know so i guess it also is it's worth saying as well just to end this segment before we go into neom is that i i there are a couple of people who i can sort of call to be like so what's what's going on with the government right what's going what is what are they actually what do these people actually think i asked them and they and i asked are the people in charge aware of the fact that they're like are they aware of the fact that their plans haven't worked and won't work are they or are they in denial about like are they personally in denial about what can only be described as like britain having to reckon with no longer with being a developing country now or being an emerging market
2486.06 2494.66 SPEAKER_04  you talking to the government source is like when they go to the fucking mortgage at trader expo in in las vegas in the big short and they're like they're fucking delusional they don't fucking know
2494.66 2501.90 SPEAKER_02  anything and the answer is uh yeah they're in denial about it oh great yeah yeah they are
2501.90 2547.42 SPEAKER_03  yeah to be fair that was that was all the response you needed yeah yeah no i i just i was going to say well in some ways that's preferable right to them to them thinking oh yeah this is great light it all on fire right but um yeah no i i i feel uh you know obviously we're we're thinking about kind of like very very late soviet union vibes but to me this is this is something like pre-world war one austro-hungarian empire where everybody kind of knows it's a joke apart from the people who are like in the bureaucracy who are like so focused on themselves and their sort of like various ridiculous mustaches that they're like yeah no this is gonna go great invade serbia perfect should be fine not
2547.42 2580.86 SPEAKER_02  even worried about it like genuinely yes genuinely yes i i know also that you know it's not like i i think that there was a realistic possibility that like the labor government are accelerationists or something like they must believe some element of this will work but the question really is do they understand the scale of the challenges they face versus the scale of the tools that they have left themselves to confront it and the answer is they do not they do not understand that their tools are not equal to the job they think they're doing well well thanks riley that's really cheered me up
2580.86 2611.52 SPEAKER_04  actually sorry i feel a lot better after that ah yeah it's a shame that we don't have an even more sclerotic culture like japan because then at least kirstama would have to commit seppuku you know he would like the bond the bond yield would go up to six percent and he would be like i have failed the people of this country and disembowel himself before rachel reeves takes off his head i've offered my seppuku poem to ken charles iii and they're both dressed as arabs
2611.52 2622.40 SPEAKER_03  rosas are red violets are blue markets yield blossom
2622.40 2698.38 SPEAKER_02  look this is uh i want to end on this this is a little more neom news breaking i said we get to this i've been saying we get to this for episodes and episodes but we i've it's always been bumped but i want to talk about it so the wall street journal last year a mckinsey consultant died in a head-on crash at night in neom after safety all 200 meters of it like what do they mean remember it really into a volocopter horrible yeah remember neom is the region the line is the city right okay yeah so what we're talking about is p is the the real city they had to build beside the fake city so that the people living in the real city could build the fake city yeah right okay yeah yeah if he thought the line was such a fucking good idea how come the real city that they built for people working on the line to live in isn't also a line yeah they don't believe in it oh sorry neom no you're thinking of dr neom's monster yeah so last year mckenzie consultant died in a head-on crash at night after safety staff warned neom management about the dangers of driving late on the region's roads well they didn't put it in powerpoint format so he hadn't read that well also it's just this is about like the dysfunction of the neom project itself uh laborers at one of the migrant worker camps mounted a violent protest over frustration with food quality and children as young as eight have been
2698.38 2722.76 SPEAKER_04  caught driving trucks no this is cool actually sorry occasionally a detail just comes out i'm like yeah that whips i hope they were smoking cigarettes at the same time it's like eight year old boy who has like a wife like you know he's like driving a truck he's got like a wife and a kid somehow in the in the fucking visor he's like chaining camel yellows like oh another day driving
2722.76 2732.22 SPEAKER_02  the fucking neom truck so current and former neom staff say the incidents illustrate what can go wrong when so many people arrive in an isolated part of the world to build a highly ambitious
2732.22 2738.74 SPEAKER_03  project on an aggressive timetable it's almost as if this was some kind of a stupid idea so white
2738.74 2743.94 SPEAKER_04  collar workers i'm just trying to get home so i can watch ben 10 come on mate get a move on white
2743.94 2772.24 SPEAKER_02  collar workers began moving to the site on the edge of the shores of the red sea in 2020 and since then clusters of modular housing compounds have sprouted uh giving the project many of the problems associated with a small city but without any mechanism to deal with them so yeah that's the what crazy the one thing neom didn't plan is that we're going to import like a hundred thousand people 25 000 of them european glasses guys and their families but we're not going to create the infrastructure for them to
2772.24 2784.44 SPEAKER_04  exist the only solution is kid zania kid bin men kid traffic wardens that were like laying on the horn it's fucking spaghetti oops tonight come on so current and former employees say there's a lack
2784.44 2845.64 SPEAKER_02  of investment in emergency services needed to keep any city safe an independent report commissioned by neom in 2022 which again clearly has been leaked to the wall street journal said the state of emergency services exposes everybody to catastrophic risk circo uh wrote there's no evidence of a single cohesive strategic emergency plan covering the whole of neom when circo is slagging off your logistics you know it's fucked yeah so it used to be right that they all all the white collar workers worked in riyadh and then they all got relocated 20 in 2020 to show that there was like belief in the project what they've actually demonstrated is that not only is there not belief in the project but also it will kill you yeah it's like there's we can't invent a fake city that doesn't work and we also can't invent a real city that doesn't work yeah so what we've done we've created like jones town instead so people regularly ate together and saying there was a spirit of camaraderie in the early days at the time emergency services were fragmented among different government organizations across a vast area meeting the needs of a pop of a saudi population of only tens of thousands for example the nearest
2845.64 2850.60 SPEAKER_03  major hospital was two hours away i mean that's gonna suck when you get hit by the volocopter if
2850.60 2877.56 SPEAKER_02  nothing else uh as the region's population swelled road safety proved a challenge driving is a white knuckle affair mostly because you can't see over the dashboard former employees are quick to volunteer anecdotes of times they swerve to avoid crashes with trucks or oncoming vehicles careening around curves and they saw saudi children driving vehicles servicing the project subcontractors in 2021 an eight-year-old saudi boy driving a water tanker hit a pickup truck carrying two people
2877.56 2891.28 SPEAKER_04  at neom jesus come on mate i can't lose my license my wife's just started school julie burge julie burge will score driving awards as anchor in neom at least there's no one
2891.28 2921.60 SPEAKER_02  so the greatest danger to personal safety across neom is connected to its use of cars which again supposed to be a car-free city how come they couldn't just build a little version of it and then build no no no anyway they said you might say it's impossible to build at any size the report's authors said that people drove vehicles the wrong way along highways crud across the medium it overtook beyond the maximum permitted speed they launched a road safety campaign after uh three more people died as as a result of driving a vehicle off an unfinished highway which wasn't marked off
2921.60 2927.86 SPEAKER_04  this is like looney tunes shit now driving it off the end of the road just then and just trying to use
2927.86 2938.54 SPEAKER_03  the same tools that they have to discipline workers and being like if you drive your car into a tunnel that appears real but has been painted onto a cliff face and survive you will have all your limbs
2938.54 2951.92 SPEAKER_04  bone sawed off yeah this is the problem with um eight-year-old truck drivers is that their main experience of the of these things is like video games so they see that like the road just stops happening and then they're like oh it's just a glitch because when you just get close it just spawns in
2951.92 2966.24 SPEAKER_02  the following year a mckenzie consultant died in a head-on collision at night according to the neom report in the accident uh the mckenzie spokesperson said the company remained quote perfectly fine with this please keep paying us no sorry uh deeply saddened by the tragic road traffic accident yeah
2966.24 2972.58 SPEAKER_04  an 11 year old mckenzie consultant was sadly killed in a head-on collision look they get them out of
2972.58 2977.88 SPEAKER_02  out of university but they take them from really really good like key stage three programs and so
2977.88 2982.22 SPEAKER_04  like they pick it up quickly yeah yeah yeah they oh i was i was a gifted and talented kid at school
2982.22 3008.72 SPEAKER_02  when i when i was 12 they skipped me ahead to mckenzie a person familiar with the incident said that the mckenzie consultant was driving to a hotel at the time some consultants working for neon were commuting to the project from hotels two hours away much of neon's permanent real estate is of course years away from completion so they keep on building more temporary modular housing for white collar employees the similarities between saudi arabia and britain actually do kind of keep stacking i was about to
3008.72 3018.52 SPEAKER_00  say that like you know the universal thing does seem to be porticabins like 20 like the 2020s does seem to be the year of like if there's one thing to go bullish on it is porticabins um a friend of mine
3018.52 3066.02 SPEAKER_04  from uni who i've not i've not seen in years because he's always working abroad i saw him recently and he he's just got a job working for a big consultancy firm in and he's going to saudi arabia probably to work on the the mega projects and i was like i was like i mean i respect you for getting the bag but that that is crazy and then he was like why is it crazy and i was like well because they're all like fake like you know they're building impossible cities in the desert and he's like no they're doing incredible things over there and i've realized that now in our society you like even even as like if you're like from the sort of like whatever like the intelligent educated like segment you're you're now you're choosing to leap on one side of the opening bridge or another which is like engaging with reality or not and i now know so many people who are like no yeah the south yeah they're gonna build the fucking the death star in the desert yeah it's gonna work 100 yeah so former employees said that
3066.02 3103.62 SPEAKER_02  staff of white collar staff drove scooters drunk around the camps sometimes injuring themselves a worker at neon was found a white collar worker at neon was found naked and inebriated outside the camp's perimeter and taken back to his room which in the northwest desert region of saudi is a perfect way to die yeah great he yeltsin did a full yeltsin yeah saudi staff are aware of booze at the camps but generally don't report drinking unless employees cause trouble another way it's like britain yeah yeah that is true yeah they have added a rule requiring helmets while riding scooters festooning the camps and facial recognition cameras to trigger tickets for employees caught riding helmetless you can ride a
3103.62 3110.80 SPEAKER_04  scooter age six but you've got to have a helmet on come on man i've only had like three ribenas i'm
3110.80 3144.16 SPEAKER_02  just trying to get home that year 12 security guards from from the different camps brawled amongst one another leaving one person unconscious after an attack with a rock former employees said and in march last year laborers mounted a violent protest over the quality of food at the neon regulated camp uh throwing utensils and serving trays at the chefs before hurling debris at the building they're all school children well no i think they're they've got a point yeah they've got a point but the uh yeah so uh let's say things in neon looking worse than we thought they can't even build the real city for
