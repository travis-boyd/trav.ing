0.00 20.22 SPEAKER_02  Soap, unless I lovingly tuck your hair behind your ear in the next five minutes, the Russians are going to let off an atomic bomb over West London.
20.70 25.04 SPEAKER_02  Soap, Soap, we have to infiltrate a B&B in the Lake District.
25.64 28.18 SPEAKER_02  Soap, this next mission requires us holding an hand.
28.18 32.20 SPEAKER_02  Soap, we're going deep cover. We're going to Mamma Mia the musical.
34.18 37.32 SPEAKER_02  I've booked us in at ZZ's for a pre-fiat and me a little help us blend in.
40.58 42.06 SPEAKER_04  Hi everybody, it's GF.

43.80 44.68 SPEAKER_04  It's a free one.
44.86 45.66 SPEAKER_02  It's all of us now.
45.86 46.78 SPEAKER_02  Soap, it's a free one.
47.12 53.36 SPEAKER_04  Although, I have to share some sad news, which is that Alice is no longer with us.
53.36 58.58 SPEAKER_01  That's true. I feel like every time we talk about the startup ambulance, we get a different host.
59.50 67.40 SPEAKER_01  I'm finally doing a thing I've been trailing on Twitter for the longest time of changing my name to November, like the month, like the nasophonastic alphabet.
67.40 68.54 SPEAKER_01  Because you respect the troops.
68.76 69.16 SPEAKER_01  Exactly.
69.52 73.52 SPEAKER_01  Because, you know, I want to go on a romantic getaway with Captain Price.
74.00 77.54 SPEAKER_01  And I thought the best way to do that would be to change my name to something military sounding.
77.54 80.02 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, no, so this is 100% serious.
80.22 81.98 SPEAKER_01  All of it, including the Captain Price bit.
82.84 82.98 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
83.62 87.30 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 4 got very interesting.
87.30 89.34 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, Call of Duty Modern Warfare is an automate.
89.76 91.26 SPEAKER_01  It is a dating simulator.
91.84 93.52 SPEAKER_01  And that's the correct way of playing it.
94.18 95.38 SPEAKER_01  But yeah, I am fully changed.
95.38 97.54 SPEAKER_02  We're the only two men who understand each other, Soap.
98.06 100.66 SPEAKER_02  After all these years, we've been through the same things.
101.48 102.80 SPEAKER_01  It gets easier, Soap.
102.80 107.52 SPEAKER_01  You just have to do a lot of really romantic stuff in SAS selection, you know?
108.02 109.42 SPEAKER_01  It's mostly about wine pairings.
110.56 111.88 SPEAKER_01  I'm sorry, please carry on.
112.28 113.46 SPEAKER_01  No, no, no, that was it.
113.52 117.26 SPEAKER_01  That was my whole bit is I am changing my name from Alice to November.
117.58 118.40 SPEAKER_01  Please and thank you.
119.02 120.06 SPEAKER_01  It's, yeah.
120.48 123.36 SPEAKER_01  So you're out one host, but you're up one new one.
123.36 127.42 SPEAKER_01  But also joining us from beyond the grave, it's Hussein.
127.80 130.86 SPEAKER_00  Technically not beyond the grave, very much inside the grave.
131.52 132.58 SPEAKER_00  One foot in the grave.
132.58 133.44 SPEAKER_00  You're Victor Mildred.
133.98 137.66 SPEAKER_00  The backstory of this being that I did have to go to a funeral earlier this week.
138.08 144.06 SPEAKER_00  And as I was walking back from burying one of my relatives, a very sad moment.
144.70 148.64 SPEAKER_00  I was on my phone, as you'd expect.
149.20 156.72 SPEAKER_00  And in a cemetery, there are several, like, the way in which they make the burials more efficient is to sort of like half dig it.
156.98 160.46 SPEAKER_00  So that when the bodies come in, like, you don't have to like dig new ones.
160.46 169.12 SPEAKER_00  And so long story short, I tripped into, I tripped and fell into a shallow grave.
169.12 179.62 SPEAKER_00  And when that happened, when that happened, and I was very much in full view of everyone, some of whom were just sort of shaking their heads at me.
179.90 181.70 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, a weird wooden box.
182.56 183.94 SPEAKER_00  There was no box in there.
183.98 191.12 SPEAKER_00  It was just like a pre-dug grave, which like, I think has its own sort of like, you know, that has its own spooky connotation.
191.12 192.50 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, I mean, think about it.
192.60 196.22 SPEAKER_01  The person they buried in that grave wasn't even the first person in that grave.
196.66 197.56 SPEAKER_01  Like, I can't imagine that.
197.58 198.68 SPEAKER_01  It's that hot desk game.
198.76 200.00 SPEAKER_01  I hadn't even thought about that.
200.16 201.90 SPEAKER_01  You like, broke it in for them.
201.98 203.38 SPEAKER_01  And so you like, pre-warmed their grave.
203.40 211.56 SPEAKER_00  That's not like, they'll like, when they're sort of buried and like, you know, the spirit will be like, yo, this be smelling funky.
212.52 214.16 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, it smells of vape in here.
214.16 218.90 SPEAKER_01  I just want a really clean drop of you saying, this be smelling funky.
220.08 228.28 SPEAKER_00  But this, when this did happen, I did immediately tell you, because I thought it'd be very funny, and I did not expect to have to retell that story on the show.
228.38 231.90 SPEAKER_00  So I do appreciate, I do appreciate the lowlights reel.
232.16 234.16 SPEAKER_01  Look, this is a sacred pact that we're in.
234.26 238.86 SPEAKER_01  Anytime any one of us humiliates ourselves one way or the other, it's going into the show.
239.10 242.36 SPEAKER_00  I mean, I'm taking all your secrets I know about you to my shallow grave, so.
242.36 244.48 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, now you're out of it.
244.56 246.14 SPEAKER_01  Now you've got a little, like, achievement.
246.56 249.70 SPEAKER_01  One of the relatively few people who have climbed out of a grave.
249.90 255.80 SPEAKER_00  What I will say is, falling into a grave and like, sort of having to lie there for a few seconds, it does really change your perspective on the world.
256.36 258.12 SPEAKER_01  Why did you have to lie there for a few seconds?
258.22 260.38 SPEAKER_01  Were you doing the, like, Yamcha, like, death pose?
260.58 266.50 SPEAKER_00  Well, my thinking was more like, oh, this is probably never going to happen again until I am actually dead, by which point I probably won't appreciate it.
266.64 268.26 SPEAKER_00  So, um.
268.76 269.88 SPEAKER_04  Might as well appreciate.
269.88 272.02 SPEAKER_04  You don't want to be in a kill bill situation.
272.02 274.04 SPEAKER_00  Why not enjoy it for a few more seconds?
275.16 276.02 SPEAKER_04  Anyway, anyway.
276.28 291.22 SPEAKER_04  Um, we're going to talk about the, um, some items in the news today, and then we are going to, in honor of our new co-host, revisit Ambulance, the first thing that you talked about when you first came on as a guest many years ago.
291.24 292.54 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, and I made myself indispensable.
293.38 294.28 SPEAKER_03  That's right, yeah.
294.28 296.52 SPEAKER_03  Um, first news item, graves.
296.64 297.88 SPEAKER_03  Are people stealing them?
298.66 301.18 SPEAKER_03  I turned up to bury my grandmother, there was someone in it!
301.74 303.54 SPEAKER_03  There's this podcaster, you know?
304.06 305.50 SPEAKER_03  Goldilocks and the three graves.
306.30 310.12 SPEAKER_00  I mean, I'm now just imagining, like, um, a land, like a grave, like a landlord.
310.62 311.42 SPEAKER_00  A grave lord?
311.42 313.30 SPEAKER_00  You know, a grave lord.
313.74 319.40 SPEAKER_00  That's just like, this plot that you're squatting in is actually 2,600 a month.
319.64 321.48 SPEAKER_01  He'll dig you up if you don't pay the rent.
321.88 328.34 SPEAKER_01  If you're just like, if you're just laid there, if you're just stayed there, you would have had, like, you've got started on adverse possession.
328.70 330.20 SPEAKER_01  You know, you would have had the squatter's rights.
330.62 347.82 SPEAKER_00  There are stories of it happening very quickly, because I can't remember where it was, but, like, there was sort of, like, a cemetery that was owned privately, and the guy who owned it wanted to sell the land, and, um, I don't know what happened to it, but the idea was if he was going to sell the land to developers, like, they would have to dig up the graves and sort of put them somewhere else.
348.30 348.66 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
348.86 351.02 SPEAKER_03  It's a lovely, uh, single aspect space.
351.02 355.70 SPEAKER_03  Uh, it's about, uh, six feet by, by two feet by, uh, by six feet.
355.84 356.76 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, you could put a kitchen in there.
356.76 359.20 SPEAKER_03  They're using it as a grave, but, like, a home office.
359.20 361.10 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, it's a brandless note, you know?
361.18 362.02 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, that's right.
362.56 363.40 SPEAKER_04  All right, all right, all right.
363.62 363.98 SPEAKER_04  Storage.
364.56 370.00 SPEAKER_04  Let's, let's, uh, weirdly, I was going to say, let's leave the graveyard behind for a jarring change in tone.
370.38 382.32 SPEAKER_04  We must, I think, discuss, I think, before we move on, the ongoing, I would say, the grim conclusion to the media circus that has surrounded, uh, the murder of Brianna Jai.
382.66 388.80 SPEAKER_04  Um, and I think we can start with the fact that in Parliament, while Starmer was doing his usual thing.
388.80 389.72 SPEAKER_04  PMQs, yeah.
390.18 395.70 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, Brianna Jai's mother, Esther, was in the sort of galleries, right?
395.90 400.78 SPEAKER_04  And Sunak comes up to the dispatch box and says, well, I'm ready to use the line.
400.94 405.12 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, he's doing it, but I'm like, it's, BBC News has since described this as a jibe.
405.20 406.78 SPEAKER_01  I've seen it elsewhere described as a joke.
407.12 414.62 SPEAKER_01  So Sunak comes up with his Tommy Cooper fez on to the dispatch box and says, have you heard the one about, about knowing what a woman is?
414.68 415.22 SPEAKER_01  Just like that.
415.42 415.64 SPEAKER_01  Boom, boom.
415.64 416.00 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
416.40 419.90 SPEAKER_01  The weird thing was he died at the dispatch box and no one knows for 45 minutes.
420.58 420.70 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
421.14 432.86 SPEAKER_04  So, and so he does the one, he does the thing because he's, he has been conditioned like a dog to be like, I know how to make all of these, you know, like hooting morons clap for me.
432.94 433.08 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
433.08 436.58 SPEAKER_01  And he doesn't even know what a woman is, which is not a trans woman, apparently.
437.00 447.94 SPEAKER_04  Oh, Starmer is saying, you know, he's saying he knows what's going to happen, but he doesn't even know what a woman is, which is the, the line that they use over and over and over and over again.
448.24 450.42 SPEAKER_04  And it's always reported as trouble for labor.
450.62 455.74 SPEAKER_04  Is it unable to define what, of course, labor is able to, to define what a woman is.
455.80 457.56 SPEAKER_04  They use a very transphobic definition.
457.84 458.14 SPEAKER_01  Yes.
458.46 458.68 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
459.32 461.02 SPEAKER_04  Not transphobic enough, John.
461.34 461.50 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
461.50 465.84 SPEAKER_01  But so this, this kind of seemed to surprise shock, even Starmer.
466.36 474.04 SPEAKER_01  And he, he since did the, like, you know, how dare you at a time like this, any other week of the year would be totally acceptable.
474.04 476.86 SPEAKER_01  And I would, you know, completely fold to what you're saying.
476.86 484.64 SPEAKER_01  But, you know, as we know, in our sort of like liberal understanding, the most important person in relation to trans rights is parent of one.
485.08 490.52 SPEAKER_01  And so what you've done is you, you have transgressed here by, by being rude and cruel.
491.52 498.80 SPEAKER_03  Well, because it's still parent of dead child, regardless of transness, which as we know, marks it down a few points in their eyes, but still dead child parent.
498.96 499.64 SPEAKER_03  That's pretty sympathetic.
500.10 500.88 SPEAKER_01  So, yeah, absolutely.
501.42 505.60 SPEAKER_01  And so now Sunak is, is sort of like doubling, tripling down on this.
506.02 509.16 SPEAKER_01  And I just, the thing is.
509.48 510.58 SPEAKER_03  It was a bit of banter.
511.32 513.74 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, it was, it was, it was, I was doing irony.
514.24 535.72 SPEAKER_01  I guess the thing is that it occurs to me that this is grotesquely, grotesquely cynical on Starmer's, part, like given the, you know, the transphobia is still abundant in the Labour Party, given the fact that fucking, like had Brianna Jai, like not died on the spot, had she gotten to hospital, his shadow health secretary wouldn't have let her in a women's ward.
536.40 552.62 SPEAKER_01  There's like, it's absolutely grotesque to, to make the Labour Party, the kind of like lesser of two evils here, which is barely, especially given that he, he met with, with her mother after the fact and said, we need more like mental health support for kids, fucking human gelatin mold that he is.
552.74 567.36 SPEAKER_01  It just, it occurs to me, right, that this really did rattle him, because what you might dimly describe as his values are those of kind of like, you know, metropolitan, middle class prosecutor of, it's nice to be nice.
567.54 568.86 SPEAKER_01  This is both cruel and weird.
569.32 572.98 SPEAKER_01  I'm sure that he personally knows, likes, respects trans people.
573.32 577.72 SPEAKER_01  It just doesn't matter to him when it's sort of convenient to, to gain power.
578.00 581.94 SPEAKER_01  And so this sort of moment where he was like, wait a second, this is really gross.
582.30 603.60 SPEAKER_01  I have this feeling that like, this is not going to change anything in that sense, but the sort of, the best prospect for making Britain less transphobic within the electoral process, within the political process, is ultimately going to have to rely on that kind of like repulsion of, uh, repulsion, that revulsion of liberals being like, this is gross and weird.
603.70 608.54 SPEAKER_01  And it's, it's important to just be nice to people who you think are weird anyway, you know?
608.62 626.64 SPEAKER_01  And if, if they can kind of like repeat that, which was very successful in terms of like marriage equality and lots of gay rights stuff, if they can repeat that thing of like, it's important to be tolerant to people, even though we know they're weird, you still have to be nice, then it, it will still be, terrible, but it will be a bit less terrible.
626.64 633.26 SPEAKER_01  And I think if this moment can be sort of like used for those purposes, then all's the good, but I don't, I'm not holding my breath.
633.64 633.68 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
633.68 638.84 SPEAKER_03  Cause we've said this before that so much of like the, the really rabid transphobia stuff is just so weird.
638.88 639.10 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
639.30 639.44 SPEAKER_03  True.
639.52 645.50 SPEAKER_03  It's like, it's hard to sell to the electric cause it's just like, well, if you saw a trans person in the supermarket, would you behave like this?
645.50 647.18 SPEAKER_03  Or would you simply go about your day?
647.26 649.34 SPEAKER_03  I reckon probably just go about your day for most people.
649.56 650.96 SPEAKER_03  You don't have to understand it.
651.06 652.06 SPEAKER_03  You just have to ignore it.
652.16 652.26 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
652.26 653.32 SPEAKER_03  That's all you have to do.
653.54 655.20 SPEAKER_03  You don't have to get involved in any way.
655.32 655.48 SPEAKER_03  Just,
655.54 672.54 SPEAKER_01  just ignore it and go about your day. See, like doing this reminds me a bit of the DeSantis black sun campaign ad, you know, where it's like you have hitched your wagon to a bunch of extremely online freaks who think this is the baseline cultural thing of how we're going to like divide society.
672.54 677.04 SPEAKER_01  And then people look at it and go, this makes you look like an obvious Nazi.
677.60 678.70 SPEAKER_01  Why are you doing this?
678.92 679.54 SPEAKER_01  Stop doing this.
679.54 679.72 SPEAKER_01  And he would say,
679.86 680.66 SPEAKER_06  mmm, hungry.
681.28 693.22 SPEAKER_04  Well, so this is, this is actually what, I think we can link this as well in, in these terms anyway, into like the, the ongoing story of the British conservative party sort of descending into online strangeness.
693.28 693.58 SPEAKER_04  Oh yeah.
693.78 695.48 SPEAKER_01  We've got some Liz Truss later about that.
695.48 695.92 SPEAKER_01  Exactly.
696.42 702.54 SPEAKER_04  Liz, Liz Truss is back and not realizing, right, that her career in British politics is over.
702.66 707.36 SPEAKER_04  She now has to be an American lecturer, which will be way more lucrative and she'll have more fun with it.
707.60 708.00 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
708.18 710.14 SPEAKER_01  Sort of course convener at the University of Austin.
710.50 710.72 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
710.84 711.60 SPEAKER_04  We support this.
711.86 712.06 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
712.16 722.40 SPEAKER_04  But talking, go get the bag, Liz, but launching her movement, popular conservatism, which is finally trying real conservatism, but she didn't get a chance to, when she was in office, I guess.
722.40 725.44 SPEAKER_03  University of Austin, bankrupted by the bathrobe.
725.48 725.78 SPEAKER_01  Bill?
726.44 726.80 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
726.92 727.28 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
727.28 728.94 SPEAKER_01  Real conservatism has never been tried.
729.24 730.38 SPEAKER_03  She can't get through them.
730.42 731.34 SPEAKER_03  We had no idea.
732.16 734.56 SPEAKER_03  I got boys bringing truckloads of them up to our office.
735.30 741.98 SPEAKER_04  This is, this is Liz Truss saying almost proudly, you know, too many of our colleagues are looking at what jobs they get when they leave parliament.
742.12 743.88 SPEAKER_04  They want to be popular at London dinner parties.
744.18 745.90 SPEAKER_04  I never get invited to those parties.
746.28 746.42 SPEAKER_04  Well,
746.44 747.72 SPEAKER_01  because it clashes with foreboding,
748.00 749.42 SPEAKER_04  you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
749.42 749.50 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
749.62 763.40 SPEAKER_04  Also lambasting, wokeism, net zero immigration, saying that governments are being stymied when trying to respond to, in a conservative way, saying, I believe a fundamental issue is that for years and years and years, the sequel to years and years, conservatives have not taken on the left wing extremist.
763.70 766.76 SPEAKER_04  This is, she's the honorable minister for going on the computer.
767.10 768.30 SPEAKER_04  And so is Rishi Sunak.
768.30 769.44 SPEAKER_01  And so are the rest of them.
769.44 775.72 SPEAKER_01  You know, this Liz Truss thing is like specifically, it's like when a band who were one hit wonders put out a greatest hits thing years later.
775.88 777.78 SPEAKER_00  And you have to have all of the stuff.
777.78 777.88 SPEAKER_00  A lot of remixes.
778.36 778.54 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
778.70 778.82 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
778.92 779.00 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
779.22 781.96 SPEAKER_01  So like Liz Truss is like, not like one hit.
782.30 783.78 SPEAKER_01  I am going to crash the economy.
784.24 786.04 SPEAKER_01  That's like track one side one.
786.16 791.42 SPEAKER_01  And then the rest of it is wokeery, you know, environmentalism, socialism.
792.38 793.44 SPEAKER_03  She's the Venger boys.
793.78 793.96 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
794.12 798.52 SPEAKER_03  I was going to say, so I listened to the Jeremy Vine show today, as I often do.
798.52 798.70 SPEAKER_01  Of course.
798.94 805.78 SPEAKER_03  And there was like a, one of the topics that he had on it was sort of just people just debating like what they made of like Sunak making this comment in the comments.
805.82 820.62 SPEAKER_03  And it was amazing watching like media people and even members of the general public, most of whom were being pretty disapproving of it, all being in a kind of fairly milquetoast way, just struggling to find an explanation of why he would say something like this.
820.62 830.12 SPEAKER_03  It isn't just like Rishi Sunak's a stupid cunt who doesn't like, who didn't think about any of this because even strategically, strategically, it's just a stupid thing to say because what's going to happen is this.
830.56 837.82 SPEAKER_03  Like if it, it just makes you look like a stupid cunt, but it was so like British media where it's like, well, of course we can't consider the proposition that he's a stupid cunt.
838.16 843.38 SPEAKER_03  We've got to, we've got to come up with some like master plan, be it Machiavellian or otherwise, why he's doing this.
843.40 844.92 SPEAKER_03  It's like, no, he's a stupid cunt.
845.08 846.98 SPEAKER_01  And that's why he said it open and shut.
847.52 863.66 SPEAKER_01  I may be going to hand it to Starmer that maybe this is part of the Starmer master plan, because if you're playing poker against someone who like folds every hand, 500 consecutive hands, then maybe one time when you like trip over your own dick because you expect him to fold and be like, yeah, Mr.
863.74 866.04 SPEAKER_01  Speaker, I actually don't know what a woman is and I'm gay.
866.42 872.34 SPEAKER_01  Then like the one time that doesn't work out for you up until then, it's been a winning strategy.
872.88 873.86 SPEAKER_03  Starmer jutsu.
873.96 875.26 SPEAKER_03  We're all in the starmy army.
875.44 875.64 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
875.74 885.40 SPEAKER_01  If you just get like to like 99% transphobia levels and just stay there, then eventually your opponent will hit the 100% marker and will flip over again.
885.70 885.74 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
885.88 889.38 SPEAKER_03  When your enemy is making a mistake, be sure to say, um, excuse me.
891.26 893.56 SPEAKER_03  Well, I don't think there's any need for that.
893.80 902.20 SPEAKER_04  I think this, right, this goes, it's, this goes back around where it's easy to say, right, that the only norms these people respect are polite, are politeness.
902.34 910.22 SPEAKER_04  There's no sort of thoroughgoing idea of like actual, you know, liberation for these, these groups of people that they actually care about.
910.78 932.52 SPEAKER_04  But I think it goes back to this broader theme, which is that the more specifically that the right with its, uh, I'd say political space now thoroughly occupied by labor, the more that this is forced them into, into a very strange place and they are going to be strange for quite a while.
932.52 946.58 SPEAKER_04  And they're probably going to be quite off putting for a while, but eventually, right, they, even after these, all of these issues, like just as like, I think, I think the, in the nine nineties and two thousands, I think as you sort of compared this alluded to earlier, right?
946.62 949.30 SPEAKER_04  Nova, this is a little bit like with equal marriage.
949.36 952.20 SPEAKER_04  They went, they just got too weird with opposing it.
952.30 955.50 SPEAKER_04  When the conservative right starts talking about like, nothing wrong with it.
955.54 962.90 SPEAKER_04  So getting, getting too lurid in their details of what a person marrying a dog would be like, you get like, okay, you're off putting now.
963.00 963.64 SPEAKER_04  This is weird.
964.48 965.76 SPEAKER_04  I'm going to go away from you.
965.76 966.20 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
966.40 981.22 SPEAKER_01  You sort of hope in liberalism's ability to kind of like fence off an acceptable discourse and get to the point where like, what is a woman or like, is a trans woman a woman becoming the sort of question, you know, analogous to, is gay sex sinful?
981.56 981.74 SPEAKER_01  Right.
981.80 989.38 SPEAKER_01  Because a question that a journalist only ever asks when they know that the person they're interviewing has a weird wrong answer to it.
989.50 990.06 SPEAKER_01  You know?
990.06 998.44 SPEAKER_03  I mean, to be fair, they really read the room wrong when they tried to appall the British electorate with the idea of a man marrying his dog.
999.96 1001.74 SPEAKER_03  Like, would you kiss and fuck your dog?
1002.14 1004.26 SPEAKER_03  Yes, mostly, is what most of them would say.
1005.06 1010.70 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, the British electorate, which is like, you know, solid plurality white women is like, yeah.
1011.12 1012.52 SPEAKER_01  Would you tongue kiss your dog?
1012.66 1014.36 SPEAKER_01  Yes, I dodged you last week,
1014.40 1019.90 SPEAKER_04  yeah. Well, Gloucestershire has gone very hard for not one of the usual parties.
1022.36 1025.26 SPEAKER_04  Lord Buckethead on his dog kissing platform.
1027.30 1029.80 SPEAKER_03  It's what you need to stand on to kiss Clifford the Big Red Dog.
1029.80 1039.14 SPEAKER_04  But before we move on, I want to talk about one other thing regarding this sort of whole story, which is the role, which is the mother, Esther Jai.
1039.66 1051.72 SPEAKER_04  She then goes on Laura Koonsberg, and engages in what appears to be the only form of sort of bottom up political advocacy that is allowed anymore.
1051.74 1053.10 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, the grieving parent campaign.
1053.26 1056.96 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, the parent of a murdered child requests a crackdown.
1057.30 1068.00 SPEAKER_01  Yes, because what she wants is to, you know, ban kids from going on social media on their phones, which is, I think we can agree, probably a pretty bad idea for all sorts of reasons.
1068.50 1070.82 SPEAKER_03  And more to the point, just simply unworkable.
1071.00 1073.10 SPEAKER_03  That won't work, no point suggesting it, can't be done.
1073.20 1076.48 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, but like, she's not the only one to be doing this.
1077.00 1092.76 SPEAKER_01  So, um, Sinead O'Malley, who is the, the mother of, uh, this like young woman, the student who got murdered by like, a guy on a rampage in Nottingham, she's been campaigning for like mandatory prison terms for people found carrying knives.
1093.14 1094.32 SPEAKER_01  Also a terrible idea.
1095.32 1099.60 SPEAKER_01  And it strikes me that this is, as you say, Riley, this is a sort of acceptable space.
1099.70 1112.82 SPEAKER_01  One of the few left to do policy proposals is, if your child has been murdered and you're grieving, then a journalist will sort of like stick a microphone in your face and be like, well, what policy do you want to be different because of this?
1113.46 1115.48 SPEAKER_03  You've won one change to society.
1115.58 1115.68 SPEAKER_03  Yeah,
1115.74 1115.92 SPEAKER_01  exactly.
1115.92 1117.90 SPEAKER_03  What kind of hanging would you like to bring back?
1118.00 1121.20 SPEAKER_01  Exactly. That, that change can only be more repressive.
1121.60 1128.72 SPEAKER_01  Uh, you know, we would ideally like it to have as little to do with, uh, how your child died as possible.
1128.72 1129.96 SPEAKER_01  Uh, get after it.
1129.96 1131.88 SPEAKER_01  And I, I just feel so exploitative.
1131.88 1138.20 SPEAKER_01  And the thing that strikes me as well is I think, I think a lot about Stephen Lawrence's parents, right?
1138.22 1145.00 SPEAKER_01  Because they were kind of like, in many ways, the original campaign and grieving parents and the media didn't hand shit to them.
1145.08 1147.04 SPEAKER_01  They had to like pursue that.
1147.08 1151.84 SPEAKER_01  And they were sort of like surveilled and, uh, sabotaged length by like huge segments of the British government.
1151.84 1155.94 SPEAKER_01  And what they wanted was entirely just and, and reasonable and correct.
1156.08 1159.58 SPEAKER_01  And the mail worked out that they could use that to sell newspapers.
1159.96 1168.32 SPEAKER_01  And since then, I think there's been a recognition that like grieving parents is, is a good way to sort of like activate the campaigning press mode.
1168.80 1174.04 SPEAKER_01  And now that we've sort of, we've, we've done the, the one where the press is going to campaign for something good to happen.
1174.14 1179.28 SPEAKER_01  Now we can just do it for like, so just some other shit, whatever, you know, make it illegal to vape.
1179.40 1180.62 SPEAKER_03  A grieving parent.
1180.62 1184.40 SPEAKER_03  He's like, I want, I want Katie price to have those tits brought back up to size.
1184.68 1184.94 SPEAKER_01  Well,
1185.14 1187.20 SPEAKER_03  that's what they want. It's what they,
1187.56 1189.94 SPEAKER_01  it's not up to us. We've got Katie price on the line.
1189.96 1191.58 SPEAKER_01  It's like disrespectful to them.
1191.68 1193.30 SPEAKER_01  If you, if you don't think that that's a good idea.
1193.30 1193.62 SPEAKER_01  Right.
1193.92 1195.92 SPEAKER_01  It just, it just feels nakedly exploitative.
1195.92 1201.38 SPEAKER_01  And it feels like, I think even as someone who has a lot of political opinions, right.
1201.74 1213.00 SPEAKER_01  If I like, God forbid ever like had my child murdered, I think I would be in like absolutely no frame of mind to do fucking policy white papers.
1213.00 1224.32 SPEAKER_01  And anyone who asked me to do that, I think would so transparently like have an agenda about what they wanted me to say that I would feel really gross.
1224.32 1225.30 SPEAKER_01  And this feels really gross.
1225.42 1229.08 SPEAKER_03  Well, it's like the dichotomy between, do you want to enact this bad policy that won't work?
1229.12 1231.04 SPEAKER_03  Or do you not care about murdered children?
1231.18 1231.62 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, exactly.
1231.70 1239.16 SPEAKER_01  And particularly with Brianna Jai's mother, it's like, do we want to address any of the, any of the stuff that like is responsible for her death?
1239.16 1243.74 SPEAKER_01  Well, not really because that's all stuff that both parties have been trafficking in for years.
1244.18 1247.34 SPEAKER_01  So I guess we can pin this one on social media again,
1247.66 1256.42 SPEAKER_03  you know? And it's also like getting, getting someone who's clearly like probably not in, not in their best state of mental health and just being like, what do you think the nation's media?
1256.58 1259.04 SPEAKER_03  And we're going to like pull apart whatever it is that you say.
1259.12 1259.30 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1259.38 1261.82 SPEAKER_03  And it's like, maybe just let her be sad about her dead child.
1261.90 1262.68 SPEAKER_03  Like maybe we don't need.
1262.96 1263.28 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1263.44 1265.08 SPEAKER_00  Because like so much of like media training.
1265.22 1270.86 SPEAKER_00  And I say, this is someone who, I say, this is someone who like had to sort of do it, like all the door stopping.
1272.26 1285.24 SPEAKER_00  And that sort of sense that like the door stopping, you know, cause I, I think I've told the story before, but I remembered one time that I had sort of said that, Hey, like if someone's kid died, like, is it necessarily good to go do that?
1285.32 1287.48 SPEAKER_00  Like, why wouldn't you just be able to sort of give them some space?
1287.56 1288.60 SPEAKER_00  And be like, Nope, you just got to do it.
1288.64 1289.48 SPEAKER_00  That's just what we all do.
1289.84 1290.92 SPEAKER_00  Don't think about it too much.
1291.72 1293.48 SPEAKER_00  Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump out.
1293.48 1296.24 SPEAKER_01  And you're just like, and go to the next grave over.
1296.24 1296.48 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1298.30 1298.66 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1300.50 1307.60 SPEAKER_00  And so, and so it does sort of feel like, okay, well, even in your worst moments, you are still sort of coerced into like the media system that runs British society.
1307.64 1311.52 SPEAKER_00  And like, at a certain point, like you end up in like, it's the worst case thing.
1311.52 1314.00 SPEAKER_00  So like for a parent, like have to accept that.
1314.04 1314.14 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1314.14 1328.28 SPEAKER_00  Like, you know, whatever we sort of know about all the structural issues, that sort of all the structural problems that led to like these types of tragedies, ultimately you then become this part of this sort of performance, which exists completely externally and outside of you.
1328.32 1336.82 SPEAKER_00  And the whole point of it is that like, you know, unless you sort of have a lot of charity and like support behind you, like that will just sort of be forgotten.
1336.82 1354.00 SPEAKER_00  And I think, you know, the sort of stuff that happened in parliament today, or like in, in the comments today and like the sort of comments that Rishi Sunak made, is just really indicative of the fact that like, well, she sort of served her purpose of like kind of lukewarmly endorsing the sort of, what you call it, the online safety bill.
1354.10 1357.12 SPEAKER_00  And like it's sort of more reactionary elements, like, you know, now you're done.
1357.52 1370.24 SPEAKER_03  Well, cause also like whenever you get something like this, that's like a kind of like tragic, but very unusual case, not to say the transphobia is unusual, but specifically a child being murdered by other children is thankfully very unusual.
1370.24 1371.34 SPEAKER_03  It happens extremely rarely.
1371.74 1374.24 SPEAKER_03  Everyone's like, well, this has never happened before.
1374.24 1376.10 SPEAKER_03  And now it happens every Tuesday.
1376.28 1376.76 SPEAKER_03  It's a crime.
1376.84 1380.84 SPEAKER_03  And it's like, well, like children have always murdered other children again, very occasionally.
1380.92 1382.50 SPEAKER_03  It's not like a new thing.
1382.50 1384.94 SPEAKER_03  It's not like, it's not phones making them do it.
1384.94 1387.72 SPEAKER_03  Like the James Bolger case when I was a very young kid.
1387.72 1390.70 SPEAKER_01  And no one, no one was asking his parents shit.
1390.70 1396.82 SPEAKER_01  Like no one was sort of like sticking a microphone in their face and being like, what do you, what do you want done about this?
1397.00 1397.32 SPEAKER_01  You know,
1397.44 1403.34 SPEAKER_00  there's a lot of like, I think there's a lot of similarities to like the stuff that we were talking about regarding like knives and stabbings and stuff as well.
1403.42 1411.86 SPEAKER_00  Well, like the sort of like the scale of like stabbings in London are like massively overinflated and like massively exaggerated for like broadly political purposes.
1411.86 1416.24 SPEAKER_00  But like, okay, if you want to talk about the increase in like knife violence, like, yeah, you can do it.
1416.26 1417.20 SPEAKER_00  There's a lot of literature on it.
1417.24 1420.82 SPEAKER_00  There's a lot of like evidence to sort of suggest that, you know, that's gay.
1420.92 1421.66 SPEAKER_00  We're not having any of that.
1421.88 1421.98 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1421.98 1424.96 SPEAKER_00  But you can't do it because you, because talking about structural issues is gay.
1425.12 1425.44 SPEAKER_00  Right.
1425.70 1426.76 SPEAKER_00  And you're not allowed to do that.
1426.76 1433.10 SPEAKER_00  So instead, like it just sort of goes back to like, you know, the only answers that are sort of, you know, you, you are there to sort of give.
1433.12 1433.52 SPEAKER_00  And that's it.
1433.54 1436.22 SPEAKER_00  It's like when they ask you like, Oh, what do you think about this stuff?
1436.22 1453.64 SPEAKER_00  Like the most insulting thing is that if you actually do think critically about what happened and be like, Hey, I think there were like lots of, lots of sort of social situations and like lots of sort of, you know, the fact that we have sort of a decaying state and like that affects people on a personal level, you know, and it affects everyone eventually, like you're not allowed to say that.
1453.64 1457.26 SPEAKER_00  Like that is a thing that you will sort of be booed at for saying.
1457.68 1462.98 SPEAKER_00  And so you sort of recognize at a certain point, but like, okay, your job is just to sort of be reactionary as possible.
1463.34 1472.08 SPEAKER_00  Or your job as like a journalist, as someone who actually does get the access to like speak to a parent and like does have policymakers, like actually listen to them.
1472.40 1479.18 SPEAKER_00  Your job is really just, just to sort of justify kind of bills that are like struggling through like the commons or the lords.
1479.72 1480.78 SPEAKER_01  It's quite coercive in its way.
1480.84 1496.88 SPEAKER_01  And I think, again, I'm still thinking about the Lawrence because like that was the stuff that they wanted was again, sectioned off and like cauterized so, so quickly, even by the, you know, the papers that were ostensibly supporting them.
1496.88 1500.66 SPEAKER_01  Like as, as we know, it didn't make the Met police much less racist.
1501.00 1501.14 SPEAKER_01  Right.
1501.50 1503.72 SPEAKER_01  Having this sort of inquiry into structural racism.
1504.06 1511.36 SPEAKER_01  But it was something that allowed, you know, the, the police and papers to kind of like dust their hands and be like, good, we've addressed this.
1511.56 1512.26 SPEAKER_01  Thank you.
1512.84 1518.54 SPEAKER_01  Let's not think about this or any implications that might have now or at any future time.
1518.90 1521.20 SPEAKER_04  So just sort of drawing a circle around all of it before moving on.
1521.66 1536.28 SPEAKER_04  You know, I think that if you, if you look back at the entire story, it is once again, at every point, everyone from sort of the political and media sphere has treated it with the maximum amount of pure cynicism.
1536.96 1544.24 SPEAKER_04  And at every point, the, I think, murdered child has taken a kind of backseat.
1544.62 1544.72 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1544.92 1545.20 SPEAKER_01  Hopefully.
1545.32 1549.90 SPEAKER_01  If you, if you get murdered in a sort of like gruesome enough way, then you just kind of become public property.
1549.90 1558.28 SPEAKER_01  Um, and the way in which, uh, this country and its media particularly treats people who become public property is nauseating.
1558.98 1568.50 SPEAKER_04  So, uh, I would like to jarringly shift the tone again because we are revisiting an old friend for the rest of the episode.
1569.06 1569.78 SPEAKER_04  Ambulance.
1569.96 1570.44 SPEAKER_04  Ambulance.
1570.44 1574.00 SPEAKER_04  They changed their name from ambulance to ambulance.
1574.50 1575.94 SPEAKER_04  They've taken out another vowel.
1576.10 1577.06 SPEAKER_03  They're not fucking around.
1577.06 1578.82 SPEAKER_03  Pretty soon they'll just be.
1579.34 1583.20 SPEAKER_03  We're going to, we're going to keep removing vowels until you take notice.
1583.68 1584.40 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1584.64 1585.00 SPEAKER_03  Blum.
1585.28 1585.60 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1585.84 1589.84 SPEAKER_04  So then start adding vowels in again and they deliver you a little salmon pancake.
1590.10 1590.28 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1590.38 1590.52 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1590.52 1590.72 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1590.72 1592.44 SPEAKER_03  Um, fucking Ron, Ron DeSantis.
1592.44 1594.40 SPEAKER_03  When someone shows him a room full of balloons,
1594.58 1599.56 SPEAKER_04  this is ambulance, which we talked about.
1599.56 1603.86 SPEAKER_04  If you remember, it was basically a kind of Uber for ambulances.
1604.08 1604.16 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1604.16 1606.98 SPEAKER_04  Uh, and this is from a medium article about it in 2019.
1607.18 1609.20 SPEAKER_04  I hate the surge pricing when you're trying to get an ambulance.
1609.44 1609.80 SPEAKER_03  Basically.
1610.34 1617.38 SPEAKER_04  Um, after applying and interviewing with ambulance, Corey, this person that's being written about, if under a fake name, received an offer.
1617.38 1620.20 SPEAKER_04  He went to the company's office in Carson, California for orientation.
1620.72 1633.98 SPEAKER_04  The office he remembers was pretty legit and modern looking, reminding him of an Apple store, but his experience quickly soured, saying that in his orientation class of approximately 32 people, most employees seem quite strange as if they were turned down by every other ambulance company.
1634.16 1642.44 SPEAKER_04  He says one new hire told him that his only previous work experience was 12 years as a seasonal Halloween scare actor at Universal Studios.
1645.02 1647.08 SPEAKER_03  Quick, we need to wake this guy up.
1647.60 1650.28 SPEAKER_03  He's too sleepy, but you can't touch him.
1650.48 1651.80 SPEAKER_01  Just like we wake him up without touching him.
1651.80 1655.48 SPEAKER_01  Just like doing the, like bursting the inflated paper bag thing with a bag valve mask.
1655.62 1656.06 SPEAKER_01  Just like.
1656.06 1659.68 SPEAKER_01  This guy's called the hiccups.
1660.20 1661.40 SPEAKER_01  He's called an ambulance.
1663.10 1667.02 SPEAKER_04  No, we, we, we, we're only, we're an ambulance that only deals with frivolous things.
1667.22 1667.66 SPEAKER_04  That's right.
1668.48 1672.48 SPEAKER_04  So, uh, though he said he'd been told in his job interviews, he'd be paid $16 an hour.
1672.60 1675.04 SPEAKER_04  The orientation, he was told that the rate was only 12.
1675.40 1679.62 SPEAKER_04  An ambulance told him the station he'd be working at had changed for location an hour further from his home.
1679.96 1681.80 SPEAKER_04  After 20 minutes as an employee, he quit.
1682.30 1685.62 SPEAKER_04  He signed a resignation form, received a check for four hours of work.
1685.62 1702.20 SPEAKER_01  I mean, the thing here is, and I think I may have said as much on the first, the OG, like ambulance episode, uh, under a different name that, um, I think it's, there are a lot of private ambulance companies that are like this or more like this than anyone would like to admit.
1702.40 1707.62 SPEAKER_01  This is just putting a kind of like startup gloss on it, but I am excited to find out all the ways in which it's worse.
1708.22 1708.66 SPEAKER_01  Oh,
1708.90 1712.70 SPEAKER_04  it's stupid. And there are some fellas with some names and get involved.
1713.02 1713.38 SPEAKER_04  Awesome.
1713.78 1715.10 SPEAKER_03  Have they taken the vowels out?
1715.62 1715.90 SPEAKER_04  Uh,
1715.94 1716.94 SPEAKER_03  no, they left them in.
1717.16 1718.70 SPEAKER_04  These names who are spoiling us.
1718.84 1719.06 SPEAKER_04  I'm,
1719.06 1720.16 SPEAKER_03  I'm Stivjins.
1721.12 1727.78 SPEAKER_04  Okay. Uh, so, so basically the way to understand their corporate structure is that there's a company called DocGo.
1728.22 1728.70 SPEAKER_04  Great.
1729.12 1729.60 SPEAKER_01  DocGo,
1729.70 1730.34 SPEAKER_04  the search engine.
1730.46 1731.06 SPEAKER_01  Gotcha. Yeah.
1731.20 1731.38 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1731.48 1732.54 SPEAKER_04  The DocDocGo.
1733.06 1733.74 SPEAKER_04  DocGo, yeah.
1733.90 1744.48 SPEAKER_04  And they own a number of subsidiaries, all of which are basically related, all of which basically do the same thing, which is patient, like non, often non-emergency patient transport.
1744.66 1744.84 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1745.26 1745.42 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1745.96 1747.52 SPEAKER_04  Like getting people from here to there.
1747.56 1747.70 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1747.70 1748.08 SPEAKER_01  Sick people.
1748.08 1748.30 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1748.30 1749.26 SPEAKER_04  Getting them to the hiccup doctor.
1749.34 1749.72 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, exactly.
1749.82 1756.44 SPEAKER_01  If you have like the chronic hiccups, then you got to get the sort of like ambulance to and from the hospital for your weekly, like, uh, hiccup appointments.
1756.44 1759.38 SPEAKER_01  For your weekly paper bag, Yeah, exactly.
1759.38 1761.68 SPEAKER_01  They've got the like scare actor in there with you.
1761.76 1762.30 SPEAKER_01  So yeah,
1762.30 1766.40 SPEAKER_03  we've, we've triaged your hiccups and whilst bad, they're not life threatening.
1766.40 1768.86 SPEAKER_03  So we're going to take you to the day center.
1769.14 1769.26 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1769.26 1769.66 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1769.70 1779.08 SPEAKER_01  I mean, again, like, so that kind of non-emergency patient transport is one of the easily outsourceable bits of ambulance services.
1779.08 1787.88 SPEAKER_01  This is like another one of these like things that we look at so, so often where it's like public service looking at what the most easily like, what the easiest off cuts are.
1788.02 1788.48 SPEAKER_01  And this is why.
1788.58 1788.68 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1788.68 1789.16 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1789.16 1789.60 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1789.60 1793.68 SPEAKER_04  And they also will do things like mobile medicine for stuff.
1793.74 1795.94 SPEAKER_04  You don't need a doctor for like giving you a vaccination.
1796.14 1796.28 SPEAKER_04  Yeah,
1796.38 1796.62 SPEAKER_01  sure.
1796.88 1798.50 SPEAKER_04  That's, that's the basics of it.
1798.72 1798.92 SPEAKER_04  Right.
1799.30 1801.88 SPEAKER_04  Um, so Doc go hiccup vaccine.
1803.06 1806.38 SPEAKER_04  It's just, they shoot, they shoot you up with a little bit of a paper bag.
1806.44 1806.62 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1806.74 1807.06 SPEAKER_03  That's right.
1807.64 1808.92 SPEAKER_03  It's like homeopathy.
1810.18 1814.00 SPEAKER_03  I'm going to prescribe you to watch the last hour and a half of the film hereditary.
1814.16 1816.10 SPEAKER_03  I think that's going to keep the hiccups at bay for a while.
1816.10 1820.12 SPEAKER_04  So Doc go is leading the proactive healthcare revolution.
1820.26 1824.02 SPEAKER_04  They say on their website, our AI powered technology.
1824.26 1824.66 SPEAKER_04  Great.
1825.28 1828.34 SPEAKER_04  Keep in mind that they tout that they're an AI company.
1828.54 1828.98 SPEAKER_04  As we go.
1828.98 1831.82 SPEAKER_03  I love that we're just sticking that into any company now.
1831.94 1834.48 SPEAKER_03  Oh, we do like ambulances for people with the hiccups.
1834.58 1834.98 SPEAKER_03  It's AI.
1835.14 1835.80 SPEAKER_03  Don't ask how.
1837.42 1847.48 SPEAKER_04  Um, I, I have loved learning all, all about sort of the people involved in this and the AI claims that they make one of my favorite spurious AI claims.
1847.64 1848.60 SPEAKER_04  Oh, which we're going to get.
1848.78 1849.84 SPEAKER_04  And Riley's read a lot of these,
1849.94 1850.22 SPEAKER_03  so you know,
1850.26 1858.12 SPEAKER_04  it's going to be good. Um, so our AI powered technology, 6,000 plus mobile medical clinicians and relentless dedication to compassionate care.
1858.34 1861.02 SPEAKER_04  Help ensure we keep you and your family out of the hospital.
1861.56 1861.88 SPEAKER_04  Okay.
1862.20 1863.54 SPEAKER_04  Well, isn't their job taking it?
1863.54 1866.20 SPEAKER_04  I was going to say, yeah, that's the proactive healthcare.
1866.20 1868.88 SPEAKER_01  Just the ambulance that drives you somewhere else.
1869.06 1870.60 SPEAKER_01  Just drops you off, kicks you out of the curb.
1870.70 1872.10 SPEAKER_01  It just leaves you in the woods.
1872.60 1876.72 SPEAKER_01  The ambulance that takes you as far away from, as possible from every hospital.
1876.72 1877.90 SPEAKER_01  By the time we find our way out of here,
1877.94 1882.78 SPEAKER_04  we'll be better. So mobile medical care helps drive better patient outcomes.
1883.02 1886.48 SPEAKER_04  Doc goes committed to delivering high quality, highly accessible healthcare for all.
1886.78 1890.52 SPEAKER_04  Leveraging our agile approach to bring care to patients where it's needed and when it's needed.
1890.52 1891.00 SPEAKER_01  Topical,
1891.30 1891.60 SPEAKER_04  you know,
1891.70 1895.32 SPEAKER_01  like agile, agile companies, um, still a current thing.
1895.50 1895.62 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1896.10 1898.62 SPEAKER_04  So this is, but that's like the parent company.
1899.12 1907.06 SPEAKER_04  Ambulance in the UK is specifically patient transport and it's called community ambulance.co.uk, but it's all its branding is ambulance by doc.co.
1907.06 1907.30 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1907.34 1908.10 SPEAKER_01  Like you can see.
1908.24 1908.44 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1908.52 1911.14 SPEAKER_01  There's like a billion different ambulance companies that do this.
1911.28 1921.04 SPEAKER_01  If you see something that looks a bit like an ambulance, but is fucked in some way, it is inevitably one of these like patient transport services that have been outsourced to God knows who.
1921.88 1923.26 SPEAKER_03  Voxel Corsa with ambulance.
1923.26 1924.16 SPEAKER_03  It's painted on the back.
1924.16 1928.24 SPEAKER_04  So we know who, because it was outsourced to these people, among others.
1928.78 1938.08 SPEAKER_04  So this is the, this is, this is probably one of my favorite taglines because of what the sort of converse of it implies, which is community ambulance.co.uk.
1938.08 1940.96 SPEAKER_04  A great ambulance service does not appear by accident.
1943.78 1946.36 SPEAKER_04  Wait, so their ambulance service did appear by accident.
1946.78 1946.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1946.92 1948.42 SPEAKER_04  Uh, yeah, yeah.
1948.42 1952.86 SPEAKER_04  It's the, the Aristotelian spontaneous generation theory of ambulance services.
1952.86 1957.98 SPEAKER_04  You just leave enough guys and sort of box vans around and an ambulance service will just happen.
1957.98 1961.54 SPEAKER_01  In order to bake an apple pie, you must first invent a patient transport service.
1961.54 1966.86 SPEAKER_01  So we are a purposeful, we are a new purposeful type of ambulance service.
1967.26 1967.50 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1967.58 1969.28 SPEAKER_01  Previous it was just lackadaisical.
1969.62 1973.16 SPEAKER_01  The loose ambulance that kind of drove, drives you in the direction of the woods.
1973.32 1973.46 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1973.52 1974.98 SPEAKER_04  They didn't know where they were going.
1974.98 1977.52 SPEAKER_01  It was, it was the manic pixie dream paramedic.
1978.24 1978.64 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1978.70 1981.16 SPEAKER_01  I hope my EMT can't see through her bangs,
1981.30 1987.42 SPEAKER_03  you know? Well, you see, we'd built all of these ambulances and the ambulance drivers to drive them, but we hadn't built any hospitals.
1987.58 1988.60 SPEAKER_03  There was nowhere for them to go.
1988.92 1991.82 SPEAKER_03  It's like a, it's like a really bad Civ 6 run.
1991.82 1994.14 SPEAKER_03  Just like hasn't thought through the layout at all.
1995.14 2002.12 SPEAKER_04  Highly productive, uh, with leading edge digital technology woven through with purpose to deliver social value in the communities we serve.
2002.20 2007.20 SPEAKER_04  That's not, that wasn't written by someone who speaks any language.
2007.32 2008.58 SPEAKER_04  No, it's written by chat GPT.
2008.90 2009.04 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2009.22 2012.14 SPEAKER_04  The world is getting smaller, but each community is different.
2012.14 2013.26 SPEAKER_01  Easier to get the hospital though.
2014.06 2016.32 SPEAKER_04  The world is getting smaller, but each community is different.
2016.32 2017.60 SPEAKER_03  Because we're mining the earth's core.
2018.06 2020.02 SPEAKER_04  That's what we're really spending all the money on.
2020.02 2025.70 SPEAKER_04  And healthcare economies can be poles apart, but people are the same everywhere and we are people caring for people.
2025.98 2026.46 SPEAKER_04  Okay.
2026.82 2027.20 SPEAKER_04  Cool.
2028.14 2036.72 SPEAKER_04  Ambulance Community Partners is a new purposeful type of ambulance service provider that's adding social value and sharing big tech, capital B, capital T, with small ambulance providers.
2037.16 2041.76 SPEAKER_04  Our crews deliver the highest level of patient care, capital C, and are connected and cooperative,
2041.92 2045.22 SPEAKER_03  capital C's. So it's some kind of like branded care that they offer.
2045.36 2048.12 SPEAKER_03  It's a whole, this isn't, this isn't the traditional care that you're thinking of.
2048.14 2049.02 SPEAKER_03  This is actually an acronym.
2049.02 2053.96 SPEAKER_04  So I went to their like about our technology page.
2053.98 2054.20 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.

2057.38 2058.34 SPEAKER_04  Oh, of course I do.
2058.66 2067.34 SPEAKER_04  So I went to their technology page where they were going to describe all of this like AI and digital stuff that they're claiming that would say like, here is the technology stack that we're using.
2067.48 2071.86 SPEAKER_04  Here's what we're using to do the thing, which most companies that claim to be technologies would.
2072.40 2076.10 SPEAKER_04  There is a blank page that just says register here for more information.
2076.66 2076.78 SPEAKER_04  Cool.

2101.24 2102.62 SPEAKER_04  What's the cutting edge technology?
2102.90 2105.26 SPEAKER_04  They won't say there's a place to put your email.
2105.66 2106.42 SPEAKER_04  That's the technology.
2106.54 2107.40 SPEAKER_04  We're collecting emails.

2117.10 2118.20 SPEAKER_04  I so far don't know much.
2118.56 2127.64 SPEAKER_04  All I could find about their technological claims was one of their areas they expanded into was Wisconsin and the press release for their expansion into Wisconsin.
2127.64 2135.78 SPEAKER_04  They said that the company's proprietary AI technology, which again, we always know when you say, Oh, we have proprietary AI technology.
2135.98 2139.90 SPEAKER_04  It's either nothing or it's a guy or it's another, another older technology.
2139.90 2140.68 SPEAKER_04  You're calling AI.
2140.84 2141.00 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.

2155.50 2155.84 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2156.28 2162.42 SPEAKER_01  We're hiring EMTs from out of town to like do patient transport and you can track them in real time.

2334.12 2335.14 SPEAKER_04  To be fair, this was press.
2335.40 2340.34 SPEAKER_01  A few scarier experiences than being intubated by someone who doesn't know what they're doing.
2340.60 2344.32 SPEAKER_01  So in many ways, that guy is like exceeding his original job.
2344.32 2345.24 SPEAKER_03  I can't intubate him.
2345.28 2346.60 SPEAKER_03  I'm not allowed to touch the customers.
2346.76 2347.18 SPEAKER_01  I've been told.
2347.64 2349.48 SPEAKER_01  Being intubated by a guy.
2349.60 2352.20 SPEAKER_01  I got intubated at Disneyland haunted house.
2352.20 2359.84 SPEAKER_04  Being intubated by a guy whose only training was a PowerPoint about data protection.
2360.16 2360.66 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2360.72 2360.96 SPEAKER_04  Perfect.
2361.12 2361.42 SPEAKER_04  That's right.
2362.02 2367.00 SPEAKER_04  So basically, right, this was from October 2023 that this was announced.
2367.16 2369.48 SPEAKER_04  He's intubated and he's like, no names.
2369.48 2374.98 SPEAKER_04  So remember that this was announced in October 2023.
2375.34 2375.44 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2375.50 2375.70 SPEAKER_04  Right.
2375.96 2382.70 SPEAKER_04  This is when the UK or this particular trust looked directly at Ambulance and said, you know what?
2382.98 2388.04 SPEAKER_04  We trust these people to deliver AI enabled paramedic led emergency and urgent care.
2388.04 2389.42 SPEAKER_03  Because they're not on the Patreon.
2389.66 2391.46 SPEAKER_03  They hadn't heard the previous episode.
2391.58 2392.60 SPEAKER_01  And that's why it's so important.
2392.80 2394.86 SPEAKER_01  Genuinely, it should not be the case.
2394.92 2396.18 SPEAKER_01  And this is something we've talked about before.
2396.26 2397.60 SPEAKER_01  It's like councils getting defunded.
2397.60 2416.66 SPEAKER_01  I'm sure NHS trusts are in the same position, especially ambulance services, where it's like, we, us dickheads, should not be the last line of scrutiny and defense against hiring these people, these fucking, like, circus clowns, to do your patient, to do your emergency care.
2416.66 2418.02 SPEAKER_01  Nova, that's very unfair.
2418.46 2419.82 SPEAKER_01  They're haunted house workers, not clowns.
2419.82 2420.26 SPEAKER_01  Excuse me.
2420.40 2420.66 SPEAKER_01  Excuse me.
2420.72 2422.42 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, the circus clown is actually a higher calling.
2422.82 2423.44 SPEAKER_01  You know, I have to go to clown school.
2423.44 2424.80 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, clowns are actually scary.
2425.02 2425.08 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2425.08 2428.24 SPEAKER_04  This is our clown-led response.
2430.04 2432.64 SPEAKER_03  This basically is a clown-led response, too.
2433.08 2433.18 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2433.28 2436.30 SPEAKER_03  We've had to expand the footwells on the ambulances.
2436.74 2439.68 SPEAKER_03  The size of the shoes these guys are wearing, they don't make an ambulance.
2440.04 2441.70 SPEAKER_03  So, the company also...
2441.70 2442.42 SPEAKER_03  You can get a lot of them in there, though.
2442.66 2444.42 SPEAKER_04  The company is also providing...
2444.42 2445.36 SPEAKER_04  I was wondering if you're going to do that.
2445.58 2452.72 SPEAKER_03  No, that would be perfect, the clown ambulance, because the ambulance is so oversubscribed, just like 50 patients being pulled out of one ambulance.
2452.72 2454.78 SPEAKER_04  Like a string of silk scarves?
2454.82 2455.44 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2455.52 2463.42 SPEAKER_04  No, the company is also currently providing medical transport services for Northeast Ambulance, Northwest Ambulance, East of England Ambulance, and Yorkshire Ambulance.
2463.42 2463.78 SPEAKER_04  Jesus,
2463.90 2485.68 SPEAKER_01  that's so many. Like, just while we weren't looking, like, the timeline here is, I go on the fucking Trash Future podcast to talk about ambulance, nobody listens, everybody hires these fuckers to do everything, they kill your nan, putting like a clown nose on her while she's going into cardiac arrest, we do another podcast about it, and I know it.
2486.04 2486.54 SPEAKER_01  That's insane.
2486.54 2492.24 SPEAKER_03  Adam Curtis voice, but while they were riffing about the lagoon, something very strange was happening in Yorkshire.
2492.58 2494.18 SPEAKER_03  Smash cut to some found footage.
2494.54 2494.86 SPEAKER_01  Ha ha!
2495.78 2505.12 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, yeah, the paramedic who's leading the paramedic-led thing has a big board, and he, like, turns around really quickly, and he, you know, hits you over the back of the head with it.
2505.12 2505.28 SPEAKER_01  Yeah,
2505.28 2507.14 SPEAKER_03  all the paramedics are the joker now.
2507.58 2513.84 SPEAKER_04  So, I want to talk a little bit about what ambulance has gone through in America, in the last year,
2514.34 2515.78 SPEAKER_03  before... Is it strength to strength?
2516.22 2519.16 SPEAKER_04  Well, I've written the word embattled here.
2519.28 2521.78 SPEAKER_04  Oh, oh, oh, they're like Sam Allardyce.
2524.04 2530.88 SPEAKER_04  So, again, this is not just, not just, like, maintaining their services that they have here, but expanding them.
2531.14 2531.44 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2531.54 2532.88 SPEAKER_04  In a big way.
2532.96 2533.58 SPEAKER_04  As the,
2533.58 2535.50 SPEAKER_01  like, public sector ones, like, contract.
2536.12 2536.40 SPEAKER_04  Yes.
2536.40 2542.74 SPEAKER_04  So, in September, CEO of DocGo, Anthony Capone, resigned.
2542.96 2543.18 SPEAKER_04  Hey.
2543.58 2543.86 SPEAKER_03  Sorry.
2544.42 2545.90 SPEAKER_03  They got him on tax evasion.
2545.90 2546.30 SPEAKER_03  No, no,
2546.30 2548.14 SPEAKER_04  that's a weird thing. No.
2548.22 2548.38 SPEAKER_03  No,
2548.44 2549.28 SPEAKER_04  they did not. No,
2549.28 2549.58 SPEAKER_01  no, no.
2549.68 2551.56 SPEAKER_01  So, okay, hold that thought.
2551.66 2552.00 SPEAKER_04  Okay.
2552.24 2553.12 SPEAKER_01  Hold that thought.
2553.20 2556.20 SPEAKER_01  About, about, again, Tony Capone?
2557.00 2558.20 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, Tony Capone.
2558.40 2563.24 SPEAKER_04  So, hold that thought about how, how Al Capone was God on tax evasion.
2563.36 2563.70 SPEAKER_05  Mm-hmm.
2563.70 2565.08 SPEAKER_04  It's gonna come back.
2565.12 2565.34 SPEAKER_04  Okay.
2565.34 2565.60 SPEAKER_01  Okay.
2565.76 2566.84 SPEAKER_04  Not tax evasion.
2567.28 2568.96 SPEAKER_04  I'm not alleging he's a tax evader.
2569.02 2569.74 SPEAKER_04  Okay, fine.
2569.82 2569.92 SPEAKER_04  So,
2570.20 2578.68 SPEAKER_01  are we allowed to do bits about the clown ambulance being mobbed up clowns? Uh, yes.
2579.68 2582.10 SPEAKER_03  I'm running going through the legals in his head there.
2582.40 2583.42 SPEAKER_03  The Gambino clown family.
2583.42 2584.10 SPEAKER_03  On balance, yes.
2585.38 2586.68 SPEAKER_06  So, in September.
2586.68 2588.24 SPEAKER_06  One of five families, they're clowns.
2588.26 2588.88 SPEAKER_06  In September.
2589.44 2590.80 SPEAKER_04  You gotta go to the big top.
2591.14 2592.08 SPEAKER_04  Oh, no, be careful.
2592.08 2593.34 SPEAKER_04  Dr. Johnny Big Shoes.
2593.34 2595.50 SPEAKER_04  Be careful if you ever have a sit down with him.
2595.56 2596.52 SPEAKER_04  Look at the chair first.
2596.92 2597.60 SPEAKER_04  That's right.
2598.14 2598.90 SPEAKER_03  So, they got whooping.
2599.52 2603.46 SPEAKER_03  The guy is just a dead mobster who's got like a slightly wet face.
2603.56 2605.84 SPEAKER_03  They're like, they got him with the fucking squirty flower.
2606.36 2607.86 SPEAKER_03  I hate these sick fucks.
2608.10 2608.96 SPEAKER_04  So, okay.
2609.14 2609.96 SPEAKER_04  We gotta do something.
2610.16 2610.68 SPEAKER_04  In September.
2611.40 2614.86 SPEAKER_04  Uh, you're going to the mattresses, but you squeak when you land.
2615.08 2616.38 SPEAKER_04  Uh, so, in September.
2616.38 2617.38 SPEAKER_06  I'm just around to whack this guy.
2617.48 2619.38 SPEAKER_06  He's swinging through the air on a fucking trapeze.
2620.02 2621.44 SPEAKER_03  What am I, Tarzan?
2621.44 2621.62 SPEAKER_03  Man.
2624.62 2628.04 SPEAKER_04  Paulie and Chris just like shooting up at the trapeze with pistols.
2628.66 2635.18 SPEAKER_04  So, in September, the CEO, so the New York Times, uh, again, did this get written about in Britain that much?
2635.28 2635.70 SPEAKER_04  Doesn't seem to be.
2635.70 2636.18 SPEAKER_04  No, of course not.
2636.18 2644.84 SPEAKER_04  Um, it did a couple of years ago when they were like fucking up quite badly in Liverpool, but it never sort of got to be the kind of national scandal that maybe it should.
2645.06 2647.74 SPEAKER_01  Journalists listen to this podcast.
2647.94 2648.86 SPEAKER_01  What are you doing,
2649.02 2652.48 SPEAKER_04  guys? Like, so, uh, they're, they're FT journalists.
2652.60 2655.62 SPEAKER_04  Only we and sort of other business people in other countries.
2655.62 2658.70 SPEAKER_04  Ah, Adelance is in dire need of the Wiggins treatment.
2658.96 2660.00 SPEAKER_04  Get Wiggins on this.
2660.10 2660.32 SPEAKER_04  Okay.
2660.98 2661.42 SPEAKER_04  Okay.
2661.48 2661.62 SPEAKER_04  Okay.
2661.94 2675.34 SPEAKER_04  In September, this is the New York Times, CEO Anthony Capone resigned amid growing scrutiny from officials in New York City, as well as the state, as well as the state, over the handling of its migrant care contract with the city, which was the very bad thing that, you know, they did.
2675.76 2682.18 SPEAKER_04  Capone also faced allegations that he falsely represented his educational background, which is the thing they got him for.
2682.18 2682.52 SPEAKER_04  They,
2682.56 2684.86 SPEAKER_01  they kind of did get him on tax evasion.
2685.16 2686.16 SPEAKER_04  Yeah. They, they,
2686.36 2688.54 SPEAKER_01  they got him on a homework charge. Yeah.
2688.62 2688.98 SPEAKER_01  Basically.
2689.30 2689.74 SPEAKER_01  Perfect.
2690.02 2693.56 SPEAKER_01  He claimed to be like Dr. Capone and he wasn't or whatever.
2693.72 2693.94 SPEAKER_01  Mm-hmm.
2694.16 2697.00 SPEAKER_03  I mean, he's, he's like fucking, um, Bill Ackman's wife.
2697.50 2697.98 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2698.98 2705.48 SPEAKER_04  Um, so, basically there's now a class action lawsuit against them saying, but from their investors saying,
2705.66 2706.76 SPEAKER_03  My hiccups are worse.
2707.64 2714.12 SPEAKER_04  You know, it's from their investors saying that they made materially false and misleading statements, basically being like, we're doing great.
2714.22 2715.50 SPEAKER_04  And then it turns out they weren't doing great.
2715.58 2716.66 SPEAKER_04  We have all this great technology.
2716.82 2717.68 SPEAKER_04  It turns out they didn't.
2717.74 2718.96 SPEAKER_04  A lot of the times this happens.
2719.08 2720.50 SPEAKER_04  That's like me when my mom used to call it.
2721.08 2725.06 SPEAKER_04  A lot of the times that this happens, the investors will then file a class action lawsuit.
2725.24 2727.90 SPEAKER_04  Like it's, it's sort of a bit of a technical thing.
2728.12 2730.50 SPEAKER_04  Um, uh, Matt Levine, it's part of the dance.
2730.82 2739.44 SPEAKER_04  Basically it's like, well, you can say that if you said you're doing well and you're not doing well, and you, you say you have this technology and you don't, that's a kind of security.
2739.88 2740.00 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
2740.06 2748.22 SPEAKER_04  You can say that's a kind of securities fraud, which is a bit tenuous, but it's like the, the Matt Levine argument that anything that a company does can be construed as securities fraud.
2748.42 2749.94 SPEAKER_04  Anyway, that's a tangent.
2750.50 2760.30 SPEAKER_04  Um, so basically the company was given a no bid contract by the state of New York in May to bus migrants upstate and care for them as this, as New York city ran out of room.
2760.30 2760.82 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2760.92 2764.98 SPEAKER_01  It's fully just like the public service of last resort here.
2765.50 2766.92 SPEAKER_06  I talked to Tony Capone.
2767.04 2768.14 SPEAKER_06  We got all these Mexicans.
2768.28 2769.54 SPEAKER_06  I'm telling you, they got the hiccups.
2769.64 2770.04 SPEAKER_04  It's not,
2770.14 2771.44 SPEAKER_06  I got the hiccups real bad.
2771.68 2776.10 SPEAKER_04  It's, but it's not even a public, cause the public service of last resort is commonly thought of as the police.
2776.28 2781.86 SPEAKER_04  But now it's the public service of last resort where we're not allowed to own anything.
2782.28 2789.04 SPEAKER_04  And the police, we, and the police are now too highly paid to just, you know, be, be moving migrants around.
2789.04 2792.12 SPEAKER_04  So we have to invent a new and worse public service of last resort.
2792.30 2796.00 SPEAKER_03  In Britain, the public service of last resort is not the police cause there are no police left.
2796.18 2802.18 SPEAKER_03  It's A and E, whatever, whatever fucked up thing, just shove it in A and E and we'll figure it out later.
2802.18 2813.44 SPEAKER_04  So in August, governor Kathy Hochul ordered a probe into the company over complaints by migrants who claimed they were lured to Albany by the company with promises of jobs and legal assistance and then essentially abandoned.
2813.94 2815.92 SPEAKER_01  The ambulance that takes you to the woods.
2816.16 2816.70 SPEAKER_01  It's real.
2816.70 2816.98 SPEAKER_04  Hmm.
2817.42 2817.58 SPEAKER_04  Hmm.
2818.04 2818.20 SPEAKER_04  Hmm.
2818.20 2818.28 SPEAKER_04  Now,
2818.28 2820.04 SPEAKER_03  lured to Albany. What a phrase.
2821.04 2830.24 SPEAKER_04  So, uh, we'll talk a little bit more about like, about this again, the quite substantive thing that they did wrong, but let's talk a little bit about what Tony Capone lied.
2830.32 2831.12 SPEAKER_04  They got the taxes.
2831.28 2831.80 SPEAKER_04  He evaded.
2831.90 2840.74 SPEAKER_04  So to speak, metaphorically, Capone's sudden exit from the company was apparently tied to false academic credentials in his professional biography.
2840.86 2842.48 SPEAKER_04  This is also, this is from the times union.
2842.48 2844.96 SPEAKER_04  Which one Chicago cop that got the better of him?
2845.80 2849.46 SPEAKER_04  Which he attributed to an error, which he said should have been corrected.
2849.62 2851.50 SPEAKER_01  You send one of theirs to the hospital.
2851.64 2853.26 SPEAKER_01  They send one of yours to the woods.
2853.98 2854.68 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, that's right.
2854.68 2856.70 SPEAKER_04  We send one of theirs to the big top.
2856.78 2858.46 SPEAKER_04  They send one of ours to the lion cages.
2861.14 2865.04 SPEAKER_04  What a fucking emperor calicular.
2865.04 2867.02 SPEAKER_04  I don't know.
2867.10 2867.94 SPEAKER_04  Circuses have lions.
2868.08 2868.18 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2868.24 2869.10 SPEAKER_03  Unless it's Cirque du Soleil.
2869.32 2872.50 SPEAKER_03  Particularly throwing people to the lions isn't something they do at the circus.
2872.80 2874.64 SPEAKER_03  Unless it's like the circus maximus.
2875.64 2878.12 SPEAKER_03  What kind of circuses were you going to?
2880.50 2883.08 SPEAKER_03  This is another like Riley's grandfather story.
2883.12 2883.28 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2883.64 2888.84 SPEAKER_03  They owned a circus in Northern Quebec where they, they throw the French to the lions.
2889.14 2889.32 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2889.36 2890.98 SPEAKER_03  For the entertainment of the towns people.
2891.00 2893.40 SPEAKER_03  Deep, deep Quebec where they're still martyring Christians.
2894.18 2894.40 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2894.40 2894.70 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, yeah.
2895.04 2900.30 SPEAKER_04  Quebec where they brought over like a star room, like religion.
2900.86 2901.28 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2902.28 2903.16 SPEAKER_04  Tabernacle.
2903.26 2908.12 SPEAKER_01  People always argue about what the success of states of the Roman Empire is, and the answer is clearly Quebec.
2908.98 2909.18 SPEAKER_01  Yeah,
2909.20 2917.98 SPEAKER_04  that's right. So, my graduate degree, he said in a speech to investors, is in computational learning theory, which is a subset of artificial intelligence.
2918.58 2926.86 SPEAKER_04  And this is also part of why, how he secured this multi-billion dollar federal contract to provide transportation services for, for migrants.
2927.26 2933.58 SPEAKER_04  However, then when the university was asked, hey, has this guy ever gone to this university at all?
2933.58 2933.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2934.18 2936.10 SPEAKER_04  When the university was asked, is this guy bothering you?
2936.14 2937.92 SPEAKER_04  They were like, who is Tony Capone?
2938.26 2938.46 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2938.54 2939.56 SPEAKER_04  We've never heard of this man.
2939.56 2941.44 SPEAKER_04  We would never admit an Italian.
2942.48 2942.72 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2943.94 2945.64 SPEAKER_01  We've got a policy on that.
2945.72 2946.64 SPEAKER_01  Is that it?
2946.76 2948.24 SPEAKER_01  Like, because I don't care.
2948.34 2951.80 SPEAKER_01  Like, lying about your graduate degree, you should be able to lie about whatever degree.
2952.14 2956.58 SPEAKER_01  Like, unless you're literally like a surgeon or whatever, I do not care.
2956.92 2958.00 SPEAKER_01  I promise you I don't.
2958.14 2959.98 SPEAKER_01  It should be legal to lie about anything.
2960.18 2967.78 SPEAKER_04  So, you think it's like, in order to get this like multi-billion dollar federal contract, it's like, if you can lie well enough, then you get the multi-billion dollar.
2967.78 2973.76 SPEAKER_01  Like those two guys who did the like arms dealing, you know, but maybe they got in over their heads.
2973.76 2974.16 SPEAKER_01  The war dogs.
2974.32 2975.12 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, the war dogs.
2975.32 2977.06 SPEAKER_01  Is it a crime to war dog?
2977.66 2980.90 SPEAKER_01  Probably, but like, maybe it shouldn't be.
2981.00 2983.22 SPEAKER_01  Maybe that's the kind of agility that our country needs.
2983.44 2986.18 SPEAKER_02  Meet me behind the bushes next to the Soviet tank.
2986.44 2989.30 SPEAKER_04  So, Capone, then said, Go war dogging.
2989.46 2999.48 SPEAKER_04  Said to the Times Union, not the Times, on Thursday, that while he did not have a master's degree, he had received his undergraduate degree in computer science from a quote, accredited university.
2999.62 3000.32 SPEAKER_04  I will not name.
3000.76 3001.10 SPEAKER_04  Cool.
3001.24 3001.88 SPEAKER_04  Ah, oh,
3001.90 3004.24 SPEAKER_03  this is very much like, I've got a girlfriend, met her on holiday.
3004.38 3005.30 SPEAKER_01  She goes to a different school.
3005.62 3006.70 SPEAKER_01  Hollywood upstairs medical school.
3007.10 3007.24 SPEAKER_03  Well,
3007.26 3007.74 SPEAKER_01  or in this case,
3007.82 3009.90 SPEAKER_03  Hollywood upstairs AI laboratory. Excuse me.
3010.00 3010.18 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3011.40 3011.70 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3011.94 3015.10 SPEAKER_01  He went to like Neary Oxman's deniable media lab.
3015.86 3018.20 SPEAKER_03  We're trying to program Judy Garland.
3019.38 3023.66 SPEAKER_03  Imagine AI lab, but it's all like ragtime, old Hollywood types of stuff.
3023.82 3024.52 SPEAKER_03  We're going to make a picture.
3024.68 3026.14 SPEAKER_03  See, we're going to do all with computers.
3026.68 3029.22 SPEAKER_03  The Buffins over here, built this difference engine.
3029.70 3030.60 SPEAKER_03  We're going to make a tab dance.
3030.90 3032.32 SPEAKER_01  Doing the MIT speech.
3032.44 3034.08 SPEAKER_01  That's like, you know, looks to your left, looks to your right.
3034.18 3042.50 SPEAKER_01  One of the, you know, one of you is not going to graduate MIT, except it's like, if, if you are caught, you know, MIT will disavow all knowledge of your activities.
3043.28 3044.78 SPEAKER_03  I'm a deniable operative.
3045.70 3048.50 SPEAKER_03  I mean, I'm in the K cadre at MIT.
3049.70 3053.34 SPEAKER_03  If you build a really stupid ambulance, we will deny all knowledge.
3053.34 3055.86 SPEAKER_04  Here's the fun, here's the fun part.
3056.40 3065.64 SPEAKER_04  On Capone's CV, he claims that for all of his degrees, he earned summer cum laude honors, but spelled it, some cum loud.
3065.92 3067.14 SPEAKER_04  Some cum loud.
3067.68 3068.84 SPEAKER_03  Some cum quiet.
3069.72 3071.64 SPEAKER_03  But we all bust in the end.
3071.64 3077.60 SPEAKER_03  So, that's like, that's like something the fucking Prospero would say in Gladiator.
3078.10 3085.70 SPEAKER_02  Maximus, some cum loud, some cum quiet, but in the end, all must bust, Maximus.
3086.06 3087.74 SPEAKER_02  All must bust!
3087.74 3095.94 SPEAKER_04  So, this is, so this is, this is the guy who, again, all of his summer cum laude, or smoking that doobie.
3097.26 3102.10 SPEAKER_03  The most weed smoking undergraduate, against the summer cum laude.
3103.64 3105.48 SPEAKER_03  The valedanktorian.
3105.48 3112.46 SPEAKER_03  I was, I was honking on that ganja.
3112.58 3112.80 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3113.12 3114.98 SPEAKER_03  Smoking that cheese like a Jamaican.
3115.34 3115.56 SPEAKER_03  So,
3115.70 3117.24 SPEAKER_04  this is just, this is,
3118.16 3121.42 SPEAKER_03  that's, I think it's from 21 seconds to go.
3121.74 3124.98 SPEAKER_03  I think it's one of those, it's like smoking that cheese like a Jamaican.
3124.98 3125.38 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3125.38 3131.72 SPEAKER_04  So, anyway, so this is Tony Capone.
3131.98 3132.24 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3132.70 3142.04 SPEAKER_04  So, he also has made some seriously other weird claims about AI, where he says that, DocGo, you should invest in it, because it stands out for the competition, because it's so AI based.
3142.46 3153.22 SPEAKER_04  He says, at an investor conference with Morgan Stanley, he spoke about a technology that allows the company to help migrants, a 50 step process to become self-sufficient.
3153.82 3153.96 SPEAKER_04  Cool.
3154.38 3154.66 SPEAKER_04  Okay.
3154.66 3155.44 SPEAKER_04  What are the steps?
3155.80 3156.04 SPEAKER_04  Okay.
3156.58 3157.34 SPEAKER_04  Doesn't say.
3157.68 3158.50 SPEAKER_04  B-Boy.
3159.86 3160.82 SPEAKER_04  Clown college.
3161.12 3161.32 SPEAKER_04  Graffiti.
3162.14 3162.36 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3163.50 3164.44 SPEAKER_04  Squeezy nose.
3164.60 3166.94 SPEAKER_04  He says, through the 50 step technology.
3167.40 3167.68 SPEAKER_01  Jesus.
3168.00 3174.26 SPEAKER_01  Scarface only had like a four step plan to become like fully self-actualized as an immigrant in America, right?
3174.42 3180.46 SPEAKER_01  First you get the money, then you get the power, then you get the women, and then you reproduce.
3180.86 3181.32 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, exactly.
3181.52 3181.62 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
3182.08 3183.42 SPEAKER_01  That's like a four step plan.
3183.42 3186.96 SPEAKER_01  Well, the other 51, God knows where they come from.
3187.34 3191.44 SPEAKER_03  It's like the people at ambulance when someone calls in saying they've got the hiccups.
3191.44 3195.30 SPEAKER_03  It's the scene from Scarface where they're like laughing and the money is coming out of the camera.
3195.30 3199.46 SPEAKER_03  So,
3199.58 3209.20 SPEAKER_04  $100 bills like flying all over the room. So, they also have some other seriously strange things as well, like a vehicle they call the hoverlance.
3209.98 3210.94 SPEAKER_04  Fucking what?
3210.94 3212.60 SPEAKER_03  So, so it can rescue you from a swamp.
3214.90 3218.26 SPEAKER_03  If you've got the hiccups and you're in an active minefield.
3219.46 3229.88 SPEAKER_04  No, so it is a, it is an ambulance, a normal ambulance, or a normal ambulance ambulance, but with like tank treads and four, and like a quadcopter.
3230.96 3231.28 SPEAKER_03  What?
3231.80 3232.94 SPEAKER_03  Can I see a picture of this?
3232.96 3233.62 SPEAKER_03  Is there an image?
3234.12 3234.54 SPEAKER_03  There it is.
3234.62 3235.02 SPEAKER_01  Why?
3235.32 3235.58 SPEAKER_01  What?
3235.58 3237.14 SPEAKER_01  What the fuck?
3237.60 3241.90 SPEAKER_03  I cannot, I cannot stress enough how much this looks like something from Team Fortress 2.
3242.24 3244.18 SPEAKER_03  Like, this does not look like a real vehicle.
3244.60 3247.66 SPEAKER_01  Staffed by only the finest, like, theme park actors.
3247.86 3250.34 SPEAKER_01  And no disrespect to theme park actors as a profession.
3250.80 3253.14 SPEAKER_03  When you sign up for ambulance, you've got to choose a class.
3253.28 3256.10 SPEAKER_03  You can either be a thief, berserker, demolitions.
3256.52 3267.40 SPEAKER_04  So, DocGo will display the nation's first all-electric, zero-emissions ambulance, um, as the hoverlance, a concept vehicle created by an emergency response, to any patient anywhere by a lance, or air.
3267.84 3268.88 SPEAKER_04  It's, it's, C?
3269.34 3269.78 SPEAKER_03  C?
3270.16 3273.58 SPEAKER_03  It doesn't have a C, and we can't, that thing cannot fucking fly.
3273.68 3278.48 SPEAKER_03  This is a Mercedes sprinter van, with four propellers crudely welded on the roof.
3278.62 3280.98 SPEAKER_03  These are not big enough to make something that heavy fly.
3281.12 3282.46 SPEAKER_03  No, zero chance.
3282.74 3285.76 SPEAKER_03  Have you seen how big a helicopter's blades are?
3285.76 3288.38 SPEAKER_03  And a helicopter is so much lighter than that fucking thing.
3288.50 3291.02 SPEAKER_03  And it's got four individual tank treads.
3291.58 3296.60 SPEAKER_00  I also imagine it can't really operate, like, in, in most airspace.
3297.04 3299.10 SPEAKER_00  Well, it would feel like that's kind of like a major issue.
3299.10 3300.92 SPEAKER_03  Being shot down by the RAF,
3301.04 3309.94 SPEAKER_01  unidentified ambulance. Yeah, being, being able to get an ambulance to you by air, if only there was some kind of like, thing for that, some kind of like, air ambulance.
3309.94 3310.48 SPEAKER_01  Some kind of air ambulance.
3310.70 3310.88 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3311.04 3311.18 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3311.94 3314.36 SPEAKER_01  Oh, well, better invent this Mercedes sprinter.
3314.82 3322.10 SPEAKER_03  It, it does always make me laugh how, around London, you very rarely see an actual air ambulance, but you constantly see the cars that say air ambulance on them.
3322.10 3322.42 SPEAKER_01  And it's like,
3322.42 3323.44 SPEAKER_03  I don't think so, mate.
3325.58 3326.34 SPEAKER_04  Stealing valor.
3326.56 3326.64 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3326.70 3328.26 SPEAKER_04  You might be in the air ambulance.
3328.26 3329.38 SPEAKER_01  The cuts are kicking in.
3330.06 3333.42 SPEAKER_04  So, uh, the New York city is Doc goes hometown.
3333.42 3334.42 SPEAKER_04  Said Anthony Capone.
3334.42 3341.26 SPEAKER_04  Our longtime partnership with the city field has allowed us to support sports events with ambulance transportation in stadium emergency medical services.
3341.38 3343.78 SPEAKER_04  Do you like the Mets so much that you hurt yourself?
3343.78 3351.58 SPEAKER_04  We're looking forward to showing up for our home teams and showcasing our, our wonderful hover lents for all anticipated 40,000 fans.
3351.94 3356.06 SPEAKER_04  So we also alluded earlier to improper provision of meals to migrants.
3356.38 3357.00 SPEAKER_04  Um, in,
3357.12 3357.52 SPEAKER_01  in their care.
3357.52 3360.74 SPEAKER_04  The really bad thing. The, the actual bad thing that he did, but that was sort of fine.
3360.74 3364.62 SPEAKER_04  Aside from like killing your nan with the landing, the hover Mercedes on her.
3364.96 3365.24 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3365.24 3368.18 SPEAKER_03  They gave them the shit that billionaire is obsessed with being young eats.
3368.52 3379.86 SPEAKER_04  Basically New York city would pay tens of thousands of dollars a month to dot go or ambulance for meals that were supposed to then feed the migrants that were in their care, which mostly ended up getting thrown away.
3380.02 3382.48 SPEAKER_04  And I presume they spent that all on meals for the migrants, right?
3382.52 3385.06 SPEAKER_04  Well, so this is, this is the difficult bit.
3385.06 3405.28 SPEAKER_04  It's more about sort of mismanagement and an unwillingness to sort of improve standards than it is about, um, about profiteering or at least so it seems from the available when I've been able to learn about it because they would provide the, basically that the meals were provided on what's called a pass through basis, which is like, which is they agree as part of the package of services to provide the meals.
3405.28 3407.98 SPEAKER_04  The New York city pays for them, but they don't get like reimbursed.
3408.36 3411.44 SPEAKER_04  So they wouldn't have made huge amounts of money.
3411.44 3413.24 SPEAKER_04  They just wasted a lot of the city's money.
3413.56 3413.80 SPEAKER_03  Basically.
3413.94 3414.18 SPEAKER_04  Okay.
3414.78 3418.98 SPEAKER_04  Um, they made a lot of money by providing a kind of slapdash and substandard service.
3419.36 3420.38 SPEAKER_04  That's how they make the money.
3420.38 3423.84 SPEAKER_04  Not by like this one weird meal thing.
3424.14 3424.62 SPEAKER_04  Oh, okay.
3424.74 3424.98 SPEAKER_04  Um,
3425.00 3426.06 SPEAKER_03  this one weird meal.
3426.28 3432.42 SPEAKER_04  Yeah. Ambulance service shocks hotel full of migrants by, by providing perfect moldy chicken.
3432.42 3433.16 SPEAKER_04  Chow mein with gravy?
3433.38 3435.76 SPEAKER_04  Why is an ambulance service doing this?
3435.98 3436.42 SPEAKER_04  Like what?
3436.78 3438.08 SPEAKER_04  Who else would?
3438.28 3438.88 SPEAKER_04  You know why?
3438.94 3446.60 SPEAKER_04  It's because with some, we've got Tony Capone in the head of it who saw a big, no bid for like contract and was like, okay, we have cars.
3446.72 3447.22 SPEAKER_04  We'll have a go.
3447.48 3447.68 SPEAKER_03  We've,
3447.86 3451.44 SPEAKER_04  we have a staff of haunted house performers. There's a man who loves to say yes.
3451.66 3451.98 SPEAKER_01  Absolutely.
3452.18 3454.34 SPEAKER_01  We've got a Mercedes sprinter that can fly allegedly.
3454.60 3454.76 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3454.94 3460.16 SPEAKER_01  So dumping like a chicken gel phrase for ones out the back of the hovering Mercedes.
3461.00 3461.20 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3461.20 3461.68 SPEAKER_01  That's right.
3461.76 3464.96 SPEAKER_04  So, um, throwing them down like it's a leper colony.
3465.32 3469.52 SPEAKER_04  So a doc go supervisor at the Brooklyn vibe hotel, VYBE.
3469.52 3471.36 SPEAKER_04  Which records say houses.
3471.88 3474.64 SPEAKER_01  Name after a kind of sex toy, perhaps.
3475.16 3475.58 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3475.58 3475.72 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3475.94 3476.00 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3476.16 3476.18 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3476.18 3479.38 SPEAKER_03  So, uh, or it's like, it's like, you know, the rim will get the London look,
3479.46 3481.08 SPEAKER_04  get the, get the Brooklyn vibe.
3481.16 3484.82 SPEAKER_04  So which reports 184 meals were wasted at lunch alone.
3484.82 3486.54 SPEAKER_04  The supervisor, out of how many?
3486.96 3488.18 SPEAKER_04  Uh, about 200.
3488.74 3489.62 SPEAKER_04  Jesus.
3490.12 3494.84 SPEAKER_04  Well, and this is because, and it's because, right, they are giving this food to people who are in their care.
3494.84 3499.84 SPEAKER_04  And the, and the migrants are quite rightly looking at it and saying, this is basically punishment as food.
3499.88 3500.58 SPEAKER_01  This is disgusting.
3500.74 3501.30 SPEAKER_04  I will not eat it.
3501.30 3508.60 SPEAKER_01  Like the desperate shit that you've had to go through to get from fucking like Guatemala or whatever to New York city.
3508.60 3515.84 SPEAKER_01  And for the food to be that bad that you're like, absolutely not is like 90% of you as well.
3516.08 3517.06 SPEAKER_01  That's yeah.
3517.22 3517.58 SPEAKER_01  Jesus.
3517.74 3519.24 SPEAKER_01  The supervisor serving them.
3519.58 3520.54 SPEAKER_04  Well, I'll tell you about it.
3520.54 3525.96 SPEAKER_04  The supervisor, nevertheless, of course, checked the yes box when answering whether the migrants enjoyed their meals, a common response.
3526.04 3528.66 SPEAKER_04  Some supervisors, despite vast evidence, evidence to the contrary.
3529.04 3535.82 SPEAKER_04  So written responses, even though they take yes, include clients angry and claim that the fool has food has more than is making them sick.
3535.82 3538.60 SPEAKER_04  Even as she checked the yes box and whether the migrants enjoyed the food.
3538.60 3544.30 SPEAKER_01  That's some like form jutsu there, by the way, that's, that's like high level bureaucracy to be like, was the food enjoyed?
3544.52 3544.92 SPEAKER_01  Yes.
3545.30 3545.74 SPEAKER_01  Comments.
3545.98 3547.36 SPEAKER_01  Everybody fucking hated it.
3548.00 3548.40 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3548.72 3550.38 SPEAKER_03  But they enjoyed the complaint.
3550.80 3551.74 SPEAKER_03  You know, you know,
3551.74 3560.96 SPEAKER_04  maybe they enjoyed it as a higher level that we're not equipped to decide. One migrant from Port-au-Prince, Haiti said the first day I ate this food, they had to take me to the hospital.
3561.56 3564.02 SPEAKER_03  They just left me in the woods.
3564.02 3564.32 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3564.78 3570.52 SPEAKER_04  But, you know, it's, it's basically like, we know that in the U S prison system, bad food is used as punishment.
3570.74 3571.98 SPEAKER_04  That's a thing that happens.
3572.06 3572.22 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3572.28 3573.28 SPEAKER_04  And also profiteering.
3573.46 3573.72 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3573.84 3574.54 SPEAKER_04  That, that too.
3574.94 3578.16 SPEAKER_04  And so, and in this case, it's, it's the same thing, right?
3578.20 3596.02 SPEAKER_04  Where they're, they are willing to, and again, like using a lot of political space that's been opened up for them, just be like, yeah, we are going to, we are going to essentially, um, keep, uh, you know, people coming to seek asylum in the country, uh, trapped in like a red roof in, in suburban Buffalo, giving them inedible food.
3596.36 3600.88 SPEAKER_03  The one good review is like, this food gave me the hiccups, but imagine my delight.
3601.72 3605.92 SPEAKER_03  But when two theme park scare actors appeared with a paperback.
3606.12 3614.26 SPEAKER_04  So, and again, all of this happened before the contract was awarded for them to like, take on more ambulance services in the UK.
3614.26 3614.48 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3614.48 3626.68 SPEAKER_01  Like, do you imagine that any sort of like ambulance service in England has a person who does due diligence, who Googles any of the people that they give contracts to, or who even listens to trash future?
3627.24 3630.36 SPEAKER_03  No, no, the bare minimum, which is listening to trash future.
3630.36 3630.76 SPEAKER_01  Yes, exactly.
3631.00 3632.20 SPEAKER_01  Above that is Googling it.
3632.26 3632.46 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3633.20 3637.56 SPEAKER_01  I want to see Patreon receipts from every ambulance trust in England and Wales.
3637.56 3641.48 SPEAKER_04  So this is from a short seller report, which is short, um, doc go.
3641.76 3644.84 SPEAKER_04  They say that, um, the, the problems go even deeper.
3644.92 3650.94 SPEAKER_04  We're billing practices that former employees say amount to Medicare fraud with one saying, I would finish the patient care report.
3651.02 3652.30 SPEAKER_04  I'd hit send on the tablet.
3652.40 3661.80 SPEAKER_04  It would go to an office in the Philippines who were basically looking that had I written the report to squeeze every possible dollar out, out through whoever insurance company was paying for that particular trip.
3661.80 3667.54 SPEAKER_04  Every ambulance company works this way, but this one just has an office to do it on purpose.
3667.56 3667.76 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3667.86 3671.66 SPEAKER_01  You know, the fraud department, not the department that helps you avoid doing fraud.
3671.76 3672.36 SPEAKER_01  Quite the opposite.
3672.90 3673.24 SPEAKER_04  Uh-huh.
3673.38 3684.46 SPEAKER_04  The, the lawsuits exposing multiple allegations of forging signatures on documents, billing for COVID tests that weren't actually performed, cultures of cover up rather than comply, where management covers up mistakes and patient care issues.
