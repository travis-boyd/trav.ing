47.00 51.58 SPEAKER_04  yeah uh bass is kicking drums is drumming when you're here it's dan hancocks how you doing
51.58 74.98 SPEAKER_01  very good what an intro uh yeah i'm very well thank you i'm delighted to be here to discuss uh something that's vital to british culture i think um oh absolutely and uh for for its for its many kind of attributes but also for the way that the world uh outside of should i just say what it is i feel like i'm dancing around it a little bit i forgot i need to introduce you with
74.98 91.34 SPEAKER_07  one thing is that dan dan is on the show as a british music expert and the author of an extremely good book called inner city pressure which is the story of grime i read it loved it my wife read it she loved it it taught me about i can't remember the rapper's name but the lyric about your girl's pom-pom smells like the a13 becton exit which i think about every time i go past i used to drive
91.34 106.68 SPEAKER_01  that way to work every day and my god it does smell so uh possibly the greatest sort of par in the history of british lyricism yeah i think that was it was a kano lyric um but yes i did i wrote a book about grime uh i've been on trash futures to talk about it in fact many years like years ago six years
106.68 111.54 SPEAKER_07  early days yeah i hadn't moved to this country yet um so yeah but i heard the episode you thought
111.54 116.26 SPEAKER_01  this music sounds great i must i must know more about yeah i must move to britain because everything's
116.26 121.20 SPEAKER_04  going swimmingly there uh i've got to check out grime matt hancock keeps talking about it boy well
121.20 163.96 SPEAKER_01  i'm glad you brought up matt hancock because yeah i think one of the things i want to discuss um so we're talking about uk garage we are we're talking about the the kind of genre that both fought against the new labor era but like kind of weirdly epitomized it as well um and it's a genre that i don't know i hold such a fond place in my heart and i think a lot of a lot of brits but also like i was thinking about being in clubs with american friends canadian friends uh kiwi friends um at various points in a uk garage record coming on and i'm just turning to me and being like this is why i live in this country like you know these are conversations i've genuinely had you know before midnight as well this is you know yeah it hasn't traveled as much as something like
163.96 177.90 SPEAKER_04  because like grime has had such a sort of international ascendancy and it's become so popular like in the us and stuff whereas uk garage has kind of remained this sort of you almost have to have lived in britain or be like a real like british music completist to really like know it it's
177.90 213.04 SPEAKER_01  a it sort of weirdly remains a subculture despite having produced loads of number one hits and like people who've gone on to um you know be on just like host their own tv shows the one of the contestants on the apprentice right now is uh is a guy who produced a number one garage single and now weirdly 25 years later is attempting i don't know what his business is yeah he's going to try and sell to lord sugar the the uk garage mc to alan sugar pipeline yeah yeah apparently this i mean it's it's a key to sort of understanding british entrepreneurialism tory should love garage you call yourself the artful
213.04 219.68 SPEAKER_00  dodger but when you look at your performance on the last task was distinctly dodgy yeah yeah well
219.68 225.62 SPEAKER_01  these were wheeler dealers you know it's it's it's full of uh del boy type characters i'll be the first
225.62 284.54 SPEAKER_07  to confess that it's probably the like call it post 1980s genre of uk music i know the least about i only know what i know about jungle because well for because of your book mentioning stuff like uk apache but also just because i like that uk apache song and decided to find more of it on youtube yeah and i have friends who kind of grew up really participating in or massively consuming grime music when it was brand new and so i know a little more about that and i read your book but i've only ever heard it referenced and i have no idea and the thing about it is for me is that in america we don't have a specific uh genre that we would just call garage you know in general if garage rock that's a whole different thing yeah that's like you because you and your friends and your shitty equipment and your parents your friends parents garage are starting a band yeah yeah that's kind of the the metaphor implied there whereas this is something completely different and so i'm coming into it completely blind here yeah we don't talk about black rebel motorcycle club or like yeah exactly scuzzy kind of black clad kind of sort of jet and those kinds of bands from the early 2000s i
284.54 303.68 SPEAKER_04  realize they're australian but yeah yeah this this is going to be like a like a window to you and like a version of nate who didn't grow up in indiana but grew up in like basalden essence and what his experience of like the late 90s early 2000s was like because you're like you're exactly the right age for garage but just you were in the wrong country i graduated from high school in 2003
303.68 469.14 SPEAKER_07  um and i guess i could i mean i could have grown up here but my mom was born here but uh her family emigrated to america so instead i grew up in the american midwest where in the late 90s early 2000s it was um i mean kind of grim i mean you had like the what you might call the sort of alice and shane's backwash bands like uh three doors down and stained and disturbed you had creed i mean i remember the last semester before i got my driver's license having to listen to ride the school bus and listen to fucking creeds higher every 30 minutes at a minimum because like that would just a song in rotation like that they were in a sort of just jason statham crank situation but i don't need to take me higher by creed in the next 30 minutes i was excited about the second eve 6 album which in retrospect is terrible and so if you're disappointed by that i mean yeah it's weird i went back and listened to it and there's one or two songs where musically i'm like i kind of like this but the lyrics are it's embarrassing i not only was i so excited about it i found a leaked copy on napster and downloaded it with isdn and thought it was fast as hell because it was like seven kilobytes a second so that's my late 90s early 2000s experience in america and then like and then i don't know i discovered mp3 forms and found out about like interpol and my brother made me listen to the smiths and stuff like that but i mean at the time what was popular was pretty bad and what wasn't bad was very much like college radio relegated to you you could only get it in indie record stores i remember encountering the new pornographers and asking the clerk at the the because i heard the song and he's like yeah this is this band but their album is only available as an import from canada like no american label has released it yet and you couldn't get it off amazon so like stuff was still hard to get music being too gay for general usa you have to smuggle it in from canada i mean people forget how hard it was to get stuff if it wasn't released by a major label or if a label had just decided to not distribute it enough and so i bring that in as preface that like yeah this if this was a thing that was happening that was like producing number one hits it certainly sounds um what's the right word here a lot more enjoyable or interesting than what was producing number one hits in america at the time and i say that as someone who has not only seen static x and slipknot live but actually met them i hung out on the tour bus with static x because i my school newspaper managed to get me a fucking pass to go uh you know it's bad when they're giving interviews to the school news well yeah granted it was the basis was just out of the kindness of his heart was like yeah i'll talk to these high school kids and we we got to we got to do an interview and i learned how wayne static did his hair which probably means nothing to you guys unless you care about weird shitty i can't even genre wise like like static x was like white zombie backwash the way that like three doors down was allison chains backwash but wayne static had this hair that stuck straight up like straight straight straight up he was he was a schwartz cop sponsored athlete i imagine this is this is like i'm speaking a fucking foreign language
469.14 551.14 SPEAKER_01  right now well i'm hoping that we'll speak our own foreign language now and we'll have you leave as like basil didn't nate by the so it's gonna be like a makeover show it would have been norwich nate unfortunately so even weirder uh i'm fucking nate bethate we're gonna have we're gonna have you dressed from head to toe in avarex um like i will talk a little bit about the kind of uk garage fashion but the crucial thing to know for in terms of you know making you over is that um the men were like the peacocks in the scene like women wore like nice kind of but quite pared down black dresses and heels but like nothing showy really smart smart and sexy as all the um all the like uk garage flyers and the radio adverts which are like a whole subgenre in themselves they're all voiced like this you know come down to bazzeltown tonight um and they've gone for about sort of five minutes at an incredibly fast pace like the sort of small print at the end of an advert yeah i've heard stuff tons of the good play yeah like that but in a garage voice um but yeah smart and sexy is the look for men you're wearing like baggy uh really quite expensive designer machino avarex iceberg history kind of stuff with like massive colorful prints of like the like looney tunes characters on and stuff it's it's incredibly unsubtle like this is really completely no points of reference for me i was joking with
551.14 569.82 SPEAKER_07  one of my my other show co-hosts about um the tasmanian devil sportswear craze in the 90s in america but that was mostly for kids that's a very different thing the idea of the sort of like like you know tiny toon adventures x a bathing ape the screen print design on a shirt that's
569.82 578.44 SPEAKER_01  yeah that's exactly no point of reference you're exactly right though that's what it's like all over print like because that was mid 90s in america it was referencing something yeah yeah yeah
578.44 629.08 SPEAKER_07  recent episodes yeah yeah it's like i said i mean i'm really racking my brain for what was and all i can think of is um i don't know like we it was we were still doing baggy stuff they were doing things like tommy hilfiger and and calvin klein were still really popular uh the baggy puffy coats um like the the the the the fucking oakley sunglasses stuff like that uh chains puka shell necklaces stuff like that but nothing like what you're describing yeah like what you're describing sounds the only point of reference i have is i feel like i played like like either one of the early grand theft autos or one of those other rockstar games where like that character appears and it's supposed to be a point of reference but to a you know 14 year old in carmel indiana it's just sort of like why does he talk like that yeah yeah yeah yeah like like there's no actual uh you know animations of them they're like there's a painting like a drawing of them on you know in the loading screen or whatever
629.08 669.82 SPEAKER_01  yeah that kind of thing so i should explain how like you hit garage emerges and actually that there is kind of some american roots to it um so there there's uh i won't get too into the weeds of like the production process because i frankly have always prized myself prided myself as a music journalist and not really understanding that stuff too well i don't i don't want to be a musicologist like the culture around it's always much more interesting right um but there is there is like within the kind of u.s dance canon um a series of djs who i guess spring off from house and i think that's where the name comes from is that this kind of like sort of slightly daft but all genre naming is like pretty daft is like oh this is like an adjunct to the genre that already exists
669.82 699.54 SPEAKER_07  or do you have an extra house anyway related to like paradise garage and stuff like that because that was the thing in new york that makes sense but i don't that's later i want to say that's 80s like early into early 80s into early 90s but like when you'll you'll hear about bands either it was sort of like uh like a venue that just had this kind of like storied history like um like les bandouche in paris or something like that like one of these places it's like was just a scene place but it like it wasn't studio 54 caliber kind of thing but like just because a lot of bands were there
699.54 704.58 SPEAKER_01  but i don't know what's fun about it yeah yeah yeah yeah um you certainly get you so you get djs
704.58 735.74 SPEAKER_07  like todd edwards todd the gods i listened to a todd the god todd god edwards song this morning with no fucking idea yeah you weren't expecting me to bring you up somehow logged into my old spotify or my old soundcloud and i had two liked songs and one of them was by a band on dfa records that's american and the other was some random band and the song only had a thousand plays but it was like oh it was a british radio station doing like like like overtalk and the guy's like oh you got your song remixed by todd the god edwards of course we're gonna play it and i was like who okay he's such
735.74 862.06 SPEAKER_01  a sweet character like he you know we're gonna talk about some slightly shadier characters and the like halo of like crime and violence that did unfortunately like swirl around aspects of the uk garage scene but todd edwards like i think for garage fans will forever be pictured in his debut london show 2003 in romford he's never played in the uk before and the smile on his sweet chubby face as he wears his jesus loves uk garage shirt so he's like he was a born again christian at this point his two passions god and uk garage um and romford could cure you of both well you're right fair play well what happened on this occasion was so much more lovelier though so he he just has no idea how big his tunes are in the uk the internet is young there's not really any way of finding out right yeah but they are being like enterprising uk record labels have been shipping over tunes by by todd edwards remixes by todd edwards and selling them over here um and then todd turns up for his debut london show in 2003 which is really the the end of the garage era like yeah he's had an afterlife um a significant one but you know the pride the sort of prime period was really sort of 97 to 2003 because craig david born to do it is like what 2001 yeah i think that's right yeah 2000 2001 is the like chart moment where it's yeah becoming like completely mainstream yeah yeah exactly exactly but yeah todd edwards plays this this uh the first there's this video which i you know i'll give you to you guys to share on the socials and stuff because it is just beautiful he plays the opening song and the crowd goes absolutely nuts calls for a rewind which is a critical part of uk garage culture and infrastructure anyone who's listened to craig david will know yeah exactly um it is uh it's probably worth explaining for people who don't know what it is uh if a track is uh so well received by the crowd that they are just screaming and yelling for more the track is rewound to the beginning in a kind of way um amidst a lot of like cheers and then played again from the start it comes out of sound system culture in jamaica and
862.06 866.10 SPEAKER_07  there is like like the jog wheel or practically the record in the olden days you're literally winding
866.10 876.08 SPEAKER_01  it back to it into the start point yeah yeah as i think yeah there's a there's a t-shirt that's quite popular in the dance scene which says like if it's nice we play it twice which is yeah so that's
876.08 884.54 SPEAKER_07  and which i think i've seen it i have either seen it in the wild or seen it in sort of like borrowed nostalgia marketing on instagram that i get because i'm just the right age for that sort of a thing
884.54 910.20 SPEAKER_01  yeah yeah exactly um so yeah uh his tune gets rewound he doesn't todd edwards doesn't know what a rewind is but like but all of the uk guys being kicked off yeah he's he's like he's sort of grinning like like it you know from ear to ear but he he's very confused as to what's happening as his record is rewound for him and it's played again amidst this just absolutely rapturous reception it was the beginning of a you know long and lasting love affair
910.20 921.32 SPEAKER_02  oh oh oh oh
921.32 953.32 None  oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
959.32 978.32 SPEAKER_01  oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
978.32 980.32 SPEAKER_04  oh
980.32 1002.10 SPEAKER_01  oh oh oh And then it gets shaped into this very British or uniquely British subculture because of the elements that are added through the black British diaspora in London.
1002.50 1007.04 SPEAKER_01  So the MC side of things is something that does not exist in US Garage at all.
1007.72 1016.48 SPEAKER_01  So you've got the older brothers and to a lesser extent sisters, because it's quite a male culture behind the decks.
1016.48 1021.32 SPEAKER_01  And then they're like the older siblings of the grime generation, essentially.
1022.62 1031.80 SPEAKER_01  But the thing, yeah, I think the thing I want you and any listeners who are new to UK Garage to know more than anything is that this is like aspirational, smart and sexy.
1032.66 1045.06 SPEAKER_01  Like the songs are all about love, betrayal and sort of an adulthood in a way that like grime and rap music are about petty teenage concerns, usually.
1045.06 1045.46 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1045.46 1053.14 SPEAKER_01  Until the MC or rapper in question is a superstar and a multimillionaire, at which point it gets boring and it's all about swimming pools and stuff.
1053.38 1055.74 SPEAKER_01  But until that point it's about like the pain of adolescence.
1056.12 1058.16 SPEAKER_01  This is, UK Garage is not about the pain of adolescence.
1058.46 1073.60 SPEAKER_01  It's about being in your 20s and having enough money to spend on champagne and designer clothes and live a good life and take care of your, you know, your own business, basically, in a way that it makes all grime and rap music seem quite petty and immature.
1073.78 1075.26 SPEAKER_01  But yeah, I mean, I love both of these things.
1075.52 1077.74 SPEAKER_04  I guess there's sort of the subject matter overlap.
1077.98 1083.76 SPEAKER_04  And I think that something, a Britishness that comes through in both Garage and grime is the sort of the mundanity of it.
1083.86 1086.40 SPEAKER_04  And I mean that in a charming sort of way.
1086.56 1090.28 SPEAKER_04  It doesn't, they sort of neither genre sort of have ideas above their station.
1090.28 1094.44 SPEAKER_04  It's kind of all grounded in this very kind of like high street type existence.
1094.44 1097.82 SPEAKER_04  Even though, as you say, Garage is a bit more aspirational and grime is a bit more nitty gritty.
1097.92 1103.16 SPEAKER_04  They still both have this very like, I always think about that Stormzy line about watering my mom's plants or something.
1103.80 1108.20 SPEAKER_04  There's that kind of, this sort of thing you just wouldn't encounter in like an equivalent American genre.
1108.50 1110.54 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, no, that's fair.
1110.82 1113.52 SPEAKER_01  I think there's embracing the myopic and the mundane.
1113.92 1114.42 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, what is it?
1114.80 1120.02 SPEAKER_07  JME describing hitting you with both two different keys to his house and his key fob for his HSBC bank account.
1120.02 1124.86 SPEAKER_07  Like, American rappers will threaten you violently, but it's different language employed there.
1124.86 1129.90 SPEAKER_01  There's also, yeah, I had to, I really had to give a lecture to like a bunch of uni students yesterday about grime in London.
1130.06 1139.20 SPEAKER_01  There were American uni students in London who, as part of their introduction to London, I was sort of like, you can like map out how like London has shaped this music and vice versa.
1139.20 1141.32 SPEAKER_04  He's brought in an expert to explain daggering to you.
1142.46 1147.96 SPEAKER_07  Weirdly, people might know that in America more than you'd think because of, um, because of Diplo and Major Lazer.
1147.96 1156.22 SPEAKER_07  Because they would do all these things with Jamaican artists and they had a touring act that would be on stage with them while performing who was basically daggering the whole time.
1156.34 1158.86 SPEAKER_07  And so, at least a certain, more people than you might expect.
1159.22 1161.06 SPEAKER_07  But I have to ask a quick question.
1161.16 1161.46 SPEAKER_07  Sure.
1161.46 1171.22 SPEAKER_07  Just because of what I think about British music, specifically the electronic music that was popular in America, like at least in the sense that it was on MTV, to some extent on the radio.
1171.86 1178.10 SPEAKER_07  And that it was being played, you know, not just on like college radio, but on mainstream FM, like Clear Channel or before Clear Channel.
1178.16 1180.46 SPEAKER_07  But the stations at Clear Channel would then go on to buy.
1180.46 1185.08 SPEAKER_07  And I think of the big ones would be the prodigy, Fatboy Slim.
1185.40 1187.46 SPEAKER_07  But then you have the Sneaker Pimps had that one song.
1187.58 1189.10 SPEAKER_07  You had, um, what is it?
1189.14 1190.64 SPEAKER_07  The Chemical Brothers were huge also.
1191.18 1194.50 SPEAKER_07  Um, and that went on around the same era.
1194.60 1197.50 SPEAKER_07  I mean, 97 was when a lot of this stuff really broke out in America.
1197.62 1203.64 SPEAKER_07  And like, I can recall Fatboy Slim still being very popular when I was like in end of middle school, like 98, 99.
1203.88 1207.86 SPEAKER_07  But even into 2000, 2001, still quite like Weapon of Choice was quite popular in America.
1207.86 1209.18 SPEAKER_07  And obviously with the video as well.
1209.66 1223.92 SPEAKER_07  And the reason I bring these up is that like when I, if you had asked me coming into it blind about like what was sort of happening in the trends in popular music, specifically electronic music or electronic themed stuff, synthesizers and drum machines and so on and so forth.
1224.18 1225.80 SPEAKER_07  I would have guessed that I would have.
1225.94 1234.44 SPEAKER_07  And I'm wondering if perhaps this is one of those situations we talked about before the recording where like a band is huge and you associate it with a country they're from, but they're not as popular in their home country.
1234.44 1241.26 SPEAKER_07  And I'm wondering like, do any of those bands that I've named factor in at all in what was happening pop or is this something completely separate from it?
1241.34 1247.60 SPEAKER_01  I mean, Fatboy Slim and the Chemical Brothers were bigger probably than any individual garage acts, I would say.
1247.78 1252.10 SPEAKER_01  Like UK Garage had kind of against the odds, like great commercial success.
1252.62 1253.72 SPEAKER_01  Maybe it's not against the odds.
1253.80 1255.86 SPEAKER_01  Maybe it is actually a small example of meritocracy.
1256.12 1258.96 SPEAKER_01  These were pop driven like bangers with amazing hooks.
1258.96 1266.98 SPEAKER_01  But yeah, Chemical Brothers and Fatboy Slim make sense as global, successful global exports.
1267.54 1268.56 SPEAKER_01  Britain's creative economy.
1269.52 1280.46 SPEAKER_01  Oh yeah, I must talk about new labor and the kind of creative industry stuff because that is a big, you know, UK Garage is the alternative creative industries basically that is shut out from the official one, but is absolutely thriving.
1280.46 1287.22 SPEAKER_01  But yeah, Big Beat, which is how I would characterize Chemical Brothers and Fatboy Slim, is quite universal in the same way that techno is.
1287.48 1293.88 SPEAKER_01  Maybe it's simply the voice, you know, the role of the voice in UK Garage records that means that stuff doesn't travel as well.
1293.94 1296.82 SPEAKER_01  Because what the hell are those people talking about so fast?
1297.12 1297.82 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1297.82 1309.34 SPEAKER_01  Like, you know, in a sort of a British accent that isn't even, it's like a weird mixture of like Cockney and Essex and UK Garage voice, which is nothing like anything else at all.
1309.34 1310.68 SPEAKER_00  Like, yeah.
1310.84 1312.44 SPEAKER_00  Look at my family, where are the beer?
1312.74 1313.52 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, exactly.
1313.88 1315.78 SPEAKER_07  It sounds like Dutch Tim Westwood.
1317.04 1317.92 SPEAKER_00  Not to my ears.
1317.94 1318.68 SPEAKER_00  It's your big dog.
1319.36 1320.66 SPEAKER_04  To me at least, yeah.
1321.12 1328.26 SPEAKER_04  Was it the other day I was riffing with my girlfriend about when posh people talk about smoking weed and how weird it sounds?
1328.26 1328.62 SPEAKER_04  Oh God.
1328.74 1334.42 SPEAKER_04  And then I came out with, yeah, yeah, like in a Prince William voice, I went, smoking that cheese like a Jamaican.
1334.68 1335.70 SPEAKER_04  And then she was like, what?
1335.76 1338.50 SPEAKER_04  And then I realized that that was from a UK Garage song.
1338.50 1338.98 SPEAKER_04  Oh.
1339.12 1341.14 SPEAKER_04  I think it might be from 21 seconds.
1341.76 1354.18 SPEAKER_01  I can't answer that question off the top of my head, but you've reminded me of something very important that I have to share, which is the moment when the pop crossover happens and they start, you know, people from the UK Garage scene start to have hits.
1354.18 1362.66 SPEAKER_01  And one of those hits was a tune called I Don't Smoke the Reefer, which you will almost certainly have heard the sample at some point.
1362.84 1373.06 SPEAKER_01  I'm kind of loathe to do an impression of it myself, but it sounds like a slightly parodic Jamaican accent saying, I don't smoke fool.
1373.06 1374.58 SPEAKER_01  I don't smoke the reefer.
1374.70 1380.80 SPEAKER_01  And then it's got like an amazing drop and it's very silly, daft, kind of bash you over the head with a clown shoe kind of dance music.
1380.80 1399.34 SPEAKER_01  I discovered very recently that the I Don't Smoke Fool, I Don't Smoke the Reefer clip is from terrible, unfunny Radio 4 comedian Marcus Brigstocke, who is basically guilty of like some just absolutely horrendous like comedy audio blackface is the only way I could describe it.
1399.34 1401.42 SPEAKER_01  Kind of like Ali G type stuff.
1401.90 1403.28 SPEAKER_01  But yeah, it's a parody.
1403.38 1405.92 SPEAKER_01  It's him parodying black youth culture.
1406.10 1411.40 SPEAKER_01  And then it gets incorporated into an actual like UK Garage scene, which everybody loves.
1411.58 1412.92 SPEAKER_01  But yeah, I had no idea.
1413.20 1415.60 SPEAKER_04  Full self persists in the true self type stuff.
1415.82 1415.98 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1416.20 1416.36 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1416.50 1416.74 SPEAKER_07  Wow.
1416.82 1417.02 SPEAKER_07  Okay.
1417.10 1418.36 SPEAKER_07  That's a good tidbit.
1418.36 1418.54 SPEAKER_04  That's wild.
1418.70 1421.08 SPEAKER_07  I was thinking about this too, because just racking my brain.
1422.08 1424.28 SPEAKER_07  I think 21 Seconds is Blazin' Squad?
1424.38 1424.86 SPEAKER_04  So solid.
1424.96 1425.66 SPEAKER_07  So solid crew.
1426.14 1427.98 SPEAKER_07  Blazin' Squad, very different men, very different ideas.
1428.00 1428.66 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1428.66 1430.76 SPEAKER_07  Different microphone angle.
1430.92 1434.94 SPEAKER_07  I think I can recall hearing about it and listening and just didn't connect with it at all.
1435.02 1445.40 SPEAKER_07  But weirdly, around the same time when the music blog Pitchfork started becoming more influential, they gave a very glowing review to the first Dizzy Rascal album.
1445.40 1450.54 SPEAKER_07  And so that weirdly kind of sparked an interest in that, which I didn't realize was a separate.
1450.68 1452.82 SPEAKER_07  I guess this is what hip hop sounds like in the UK.
1452.94 1455.44 SPEAKER_07  It sounds like a guy rapping over a fucking pinball machine.
1455.44 1458.86 SPEAKER_07  And I love that album, but that was so weird.
1458.86 1459.48 SPEAKER_06  That's a nice description.
1459.48 1470.20 SPEAKER_07  Coming from the period of when rap songs and when it was like Ludacris was one of the biggest stars or like the second, was it Dr. Dre's 2001?
1471.82 1472.40 SPEAKER_07  What is it?
1472.52 1476.78 SPEAKER_07  The big, big, big, huge hit outcast albums like, what is it?
1476.86 1479.60 SPEAKER_07  Like Stankonia and Speaker Box of Love Below and stuff.
1479.60 1481.88 SPEAKER_07  And you hear that and you're like, what on earth is this?
1482.08 1488.70 SPEAKER_07  But this doesn't sound, if I'm starting to form a mental picture, it's like, let me ask this question.
1488.80 1490.98 SPEAKER_07  Is wearing my Rolex a garage song or is that?
1491.32 1492.16 SPEAKER_01  Oh, good question.
1492.82 1494.16 SPEAKER_01  Because that doesn't sound like a grime song.
1495.16 1496.00 SPEAKER_01  Not really.
1496.22 1497.52 SPEAKER_01  It's sort of garage tempo.
1497.52 1507.20 SPEAKER_01  So it's an attempt to kind of, at a point when grime was not succeeding in the charts at all, 2008, 9, 10.
1507.32 1513.58 SPEAKER_01  And it felt like, it seemed like that entire scene had just failed to fulfill its promise and sunk and it was never going to be heard of again.
1514.18 1531.40 SPEAKER_01  Wiley hooks up with this producer, Bless Beats, who has had the idea, I think it was his idea, to like, take the Brit's love of Ibiza and synths and marry it with the fact that you have a generation of talented MCs who don't seem to be able to get hits anywhere, don't seem to be able to get major label deals.
1533.08 1547.72 SPEAKER_01  And, you know, hey Presto, you've got like a new form of British pop, which is extremely, I mean, wearing my Rolex is probably the best example of what then became a rubbish kind of pop sub-genre of like, of stuff that's just like, yeah, I'm by the pool.
1547.72 1548.52 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, yeah.
1548.52 1551.78 SPEAKER_07  Calvin Harris and Dizzy Rascal Dance With Me would be an example of that too.
1551.86 1552.18 SPEAKER_01  Bonkers.
1552.80 1563.98 SPEAKER_07  But like, I could tell you from the beginning that like, listening to Dizzy Rascal, it's like, there's definitely, you know, dudes who look like younger Elvis Costello in the earliest 2000s in America who are like, this is the sickest shit ever, but like, but it's not going to get played on the radio in America
1563.98 1571.04 SPEAKER_04  and I can't imagine it would necessarily get huge airplay here. This garage is not being made by Paul and Ibiza, it's being made in a garage in Ilford.
1571.34 1572.22 SPEAKER_01  Absolutely, yeah.
1572.30 1575.06 SPEAKER_01  And I think the Essex dimension is an important one.
1575.06 1577.40 SPEAKER_01  Like, this is where UK Garage still thrives.
1577.40 1579.16 SPEAKER_01  Like, there are still pirate stations.
1579.36 1580.74 SPEAKER_01  We should talk about pirate radio, actually.
1580.74 1581.18 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1581.18 1582.74 SPEAKER_01  But there are still pirate stations in Essex.
1582.78 1587.06 SPEAKER_04  Well, I have a good recollection of this, which is when I was like, really young.
1587.32 1589.52 SPEAKER_04  So my siblings are a lot older than me.
1589.98 1594.40 SPEAKER_04  And so when I was maybe like five, my sister was in her early 20s.
1594.40 1597.78 SPEAKER_04  And she had this boyfriend who was like, I still, still actually friends with him today.
1597.78 1600.92 SPEAKER_04  It's like proper Essex geezer Italian guy.
1601.00 1601.20 SPEAKER_04  Perfect.
1601.30 1608.36 SPEAKER_04  I always say that Essex is the New Jersey of the UK to the extent that it even has the equivalent of the New Jersey Italians.
1608.36 1613.16 SPEAKER_04  And him and all of his mates were like massively into UK Garage.
1613.24 1625.42 SPEAKER_04  I remember being driven around in like a fucking remapped Golf GTI where he was always listening to Subjam, which was a station where they never stopped the music to talk.
1625.62 1628.26 SPEAKER_04  The talking and the music would just happen at the same time.
1628.36 1628.38 SPEAKER_04  Such is that passion.
1628.58 1629.24 SPEAKER_04  You've got to admire it.
1629.30 1629.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1630.64 1636.10 SPEAKER_07  Hilariously, that song that I'm describing the Todd Edwards remix that I heard this morning, completely by happenstance, was doing that too.
1636.10 1644.98 SPEAKER_07  I mean, it sounds like they're running like a side chain compressor, but like if they're playing the song with the guys talking over it and it's like they do that to some extent in America, but not to the same level.
1645.10 1649.46 SPEAKER_07  And I'm wondering if perhaps this is a similar thing that like that style of pirate radio winds up coloring it.
1649.62 1649.76 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
1649.88 1652.06 SPEAKER_07  You've just got like Garage or like Jungle playing.
1652.18 1653.34 SPEAKER_07  They've got to be like.
1653.70 1654.84 SPEAKER_04  Charles to Big Z and the man.
1657.08 1667.28 SPEAKER_07  I've heard clips of things before and that specific aspect of it kind of confused me of like, yeah, it's like this guy's yelling and like it's just over the music, but they haven't turned the music down.
1667.64 1667.68 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, yeah.
1667.68 1667.96 SPEAKER_01  Like it's just.
1668.26 1672.88 SPEAKER_01  That's critical like to pirate radio style, I think, is just to never stop the music.
1673.10 1673.56 SPEAKER_01  Like it's.
1674.46 1689.26 SPEAKER_01  I think that also comes out of Jamaican sound system culture, but it reflects the fact that UK Garage is like its genesis is in pirate radio stations and in the live setting and called club setting anyway, rather.
1689.26 1690.86 SPEAKER_01  So it kind of emerges.
1691.38 1701.82 SPEAKER_01  It's it's like the second room sound to house in the same way that like Jungle was the second room sound to rave or hardcore music.
1701.82 1709.18 SPEAKER_01  Initially, it was like, oh, there's this slightly weirder iteration of what we're doing that's made, you know, possibly to a slightly different tempo.
1709.50 1711.52 SPEAKER_01  The beats are composed in a slightly different way.
1711.52 1723.94 SPEAKER_01  But yeah, through those quite organic sort of DIY type settings, like no one's sitting down with a record label in a really nice studio and going, OK, how are we going to make UK Garage?
1724.32 1724.98 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1724.98 1738.24 SPEAKER_01  It comes from these kind of very these practices of like, like, you know, it sounds it sounds very idealistic, but, you know, there's no other way of phrasing it of like young people making music for their own enjoyment rather than like with a commercial imperative in mind.
1738.24 1742.36 SPEAKER_01  It then ends up being very commercially successful eventually, but only because they were true
1742.36 1759.24 SPEAKER_07  to that spirit of, you know, you talked about this, though, in your book talking about Grime. And it's something that I always found very remarkable that there are actual songs that were popular, like even not just pirate radio, like popular as club singles, popular as, you know, in record stores and to some I think even played on BBC where the beat is literally composed in a PlayStation game.
1759.28 1762.66 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, like there's a game that lets you compose big beats and people did that or it's composed
1762.66 1764.50 SPEAKER_01  in like 2000 for PlayStation one.
1764.50 1773.36 SPEAKER_07  Or like UK Garage MC, you know what it looks. Or like composed in like your because your school lab has an educational license for Cubase or something like that.
1773.50 1779.46 SPEAKER_01  Or like, you know, some software like download offline wire like in 2000 to 2005.
1779.82 1779.98 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1780.14 1782.80 SPEAKER_01  Is really like responsible for so much music.
1782.92 1789.08 SPEAKER_07  They call this the Bailey Funk method with like a crack 2004 version of Fruity Loops and just no concept of what clipping means.
1789.24 1790.90 SPEAKER_07  And that's the nation of Brazil was born.
1791.20 1791.38 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1791.38 1793.40 SPEAKER_07  But that is an interesting aspect.
1793.60 1803.46 SPEAKER_07  And I remember watching a video with, I want to say it was JME interviewing Jeremy Corbyn and he talked about DIY being massively essential to this stuff.
1803.72 1808.04 SPEAKER_07  And it seems like that's true in a lot of these subgenres as well.
1808.04 1820.66 SPEAKER_01  And yeah, nowhere more so than the pirate radio scene, which as far as I understand, and I was looking back over some of the interviews I did with UK Garage pirate DJs for my book yesterday.
1821.44 1822.86 SPEAKER_01  And they're all pretty certain.
1823.26 1825.92 SPEAKER_01  One of these guys wrote a book called The Pirate's Dilemma.
1826.10 1826.96 SPEAKER_01  I think that's what it was called.
1827.20 1834.58 SPEAKER_01  Matt Mason about kind of pirate culture more generally around the world about he went on to work for Napster when they sort of went legit.
1835.40 1842.50 SPEAKER_01  But anyway, he was a former UK Garage DJ, founder of Rewind Magazine, which was the kind of UK Garage Bible essentially.
1843.26 1850.86 SPEAKER_01  And he said like, I can't see any evidence of the contrary, pirate radios never thrived anywhere else in the world like it has in the UK.
1851.50 1857.40 SPEAKER_01  And part of, and what Matt Mason said was like, and he's long since lived in the US, you know, in Silicon Valley.
1857.40 1864.10 SPEAKER_01  Anyway, that's not because like British teenagers are more creative or they love their music more than any other country in the world.
1864.44 1868.00 SPEAKER_01  His theory was it's kind of because the British authorities sort of let it happen.
1868.38 1876.76 SPEAKER_01  So they had a relationship with the DTI was supposed to be coming around to the tower block where the pirate studio is, which is usually it's a flat that's been squatted.
1877.08 1879.70 SPEAKER_01  In some cases, violence has been used to obtain it.
1879.70 1890.48 SPEAKER_01  In one story I was told like Wiley and the rest of the Rinse FM gang in the late 90s gave an elderly Irish alcoholic man some money.
1890.72 1894.68 SPEAKER_01  I was going to bring literally up that story from your book that he went back to Ireland and left them have his council flat, right?
1894.68 1896.62 SPEAKER_01  He was like, I just want to go back and see my family.
1896.74 1904.96 SPEAKER_01  So if you pay for my flights, you can just have my flat until further notice, which they were like, yeah, we'd love to, we're community spirited men, we're young men.
1905.12 1906.84 SPEAKER_01  We'd like to help this old fella out.
1906.84 1910.20 SPEAKER_01  And so they take over the flat.
1910.44 1916.58 SPEAKER_01  And yeah, but they would get raided occasionally by the DTI, which is the Department of Trade of Industry.
1916.86 1918.56 SPEAKER_01  You know, it's their job to be shutting down.
1918.72 1920.14 SPEAKER_01  The world's weirdest SWAT team.
1920.26 1921.16 SPEAKER_01  So strange.
1921.26 1923.50 SPEAKER_01  It's such a strange little like...
1923.50 1925.02 SPEAKER_01  Like Tony Blackburn in full SWAT gear.
1925.34 1926.04 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, yeah.
1926.04 1927.66 SPEAKER_04  With like the big door knocker thing.
1927.68 1929.00 SPEAKER_01  They would phone ahead, basically.
1929.20 1938.30 SPEAKER_01  They would call ahead and be like, if you look, we have to like knock you guys out and take, as in, we'll take your transmitter down from the roof of that tower block in Bow in East London.
1938.94 1944.48 SPEAKER_01  If you just shut off your radio for all of Sunday, then it looks like we've done our job.
1944.56 1946.20 SPEAKER_01  You can go back up on Monday, basically.
1946.60 1949.96 SPEAKER_01  And so there was a certain tacit kind of like...
1949.96 1952.78 SPEAKER_07  It's just the eternal British handshake of, I hate doing my job.
1952.84 1953.12 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
1953.36 1954.04 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1954.10 1955.86 SPEAKER_07  Because in America, the penalties are pretty stiff.
1956.12 1966.84 SPEAKER_07  And I think the combination of the distance of the country, it's difficult to have, but also even in a really densely populated area like New York, like if you get caught doing it, it can...
1966.84 1968.74 SPEAKER_07  I mean, they will fine you tens of thousands of dollars.
1968.82 1970.28 SPEAKER_07  You can go to prison for it and stuff like that.
1970.60 1987.64 SPEAKER_07  And when I think about an equivalent way that stuff has broken out in America, that some of these countercultures that were driven by inner city culture, I think about in the case of just like hip hop music in New York and the Bronx in particular, but like all in all the five boroughs, it was block parties, but also like community radio.
1987.64 1987.68 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
1988.04 1991.04 SPEAKER_07  Like these community radio shows on like, what is it?
1991.12 1991.64 SPEAKER_07  It's on...
1992.26 2001.12 SPEAKER_07  I can't remember the name of it, but this stuff that's been around long enough, WBAI, where like literally like there's like a clip of it on a Clash album from 1980.
2001.30 2007.44 SPEAKER_07  Like it's that old and that established, like probably going away now because a lot of these things are getting fucking private equity to death.
2007.88 2013.82 SPEAKER_07  But it would have been community radio where they had a license and it was subject to FCC guidelines and all that stuff.
2013.82 2019.76 SPEAKER_07  But it wasn't just a guy running a radio station like that has happened in America, but it's just far less common.
2020.48 2026.08 SPEAKER_07  And I think that you couldn't have a thing become an institution like the way that some of these did because they would just get shut down.
2026.20 2026.36 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
2026.38 2029.12 SPEAKER_07  And like the stuff would get confiscated, confiscated, and they would go...
2029.12 2031.20 SPEAKER_07  People would definitely get fined and potentially go to jail.
2031.46 2031.64 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2032.48 2033.00 SPEAKER_01  And they...
2033.00 2035.82 SPEAKER_01  So when they would have a crackdown here, they would...
2036.40 2038.82 SPEAKER_01  The claims were always like, well, you know, it's...
2038.82 2044.48 SPEAKER_01  Firstly, the broadcast is interfering with emergency frequencies, which is just a lie.
2044.64 2047.46 SPEAKER_01  As far as I even understand it, that's not an issue at all.
2048.26 2049.82 SPEAKER_01  But then otherwise that...
2050.34 2052.20 SPEAKER_01  It attracts antisocial behavior.
2052.78 2064.00 SPEAKER_01  There is like a halo of like violence, drug dealing, people not registering their takings for taxes and so on going on around this, which was sometimes true.
2064.14 2069.94 SPEAKER_01  But like the majority of those stations, the majority of garage crews as well, were not...
2070.52 2079.14 SPEAKER_01  Like they, you know, there's an age old thing here about like So Solid Crew and a lot of the later wave of MC led UK garage get blamed for gun violence.
2079.14 2092.10 SPEAKER_01  There's a real uptick in like availability of guns and use of guns in the 2000s in Britain, which as far as I understand is largely to do with like the end of the war in the Balkans and then becoming more available and stuff.
2092.72 2093.06 SPEAKER_01  But...
2093.06 2095.98 SPEAKER_04  It wasn't caused directly by Craig David, several album born to do it.
2096.50 2096.94 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2097.14 2098.24 SPEAKER_01  Maybe indirectly.
2098.58 2102.06 SPEAKER_01  But like it's much easier to have the moral panic and the scapegoat and stuff.
2102.20 2102.62 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2102.64 2126.90 SPEAKER_01  And that was, yeah, that was attached to pirate radio scene generally sometimes, but to garage more generally, you know, there's just a very obvious racism at work here, which is that like these young people have like, you know, created their own culture, created their own sort of cultural institutions like pirate radio, like their own record labels, like their own raves and stuff.
2127.86 2134.96 SPEAKER_01  And then occasionally, you know, it's not that there wasn't any ever any violence going on adjacent to these to these nights.
2134.96 2138.02 SPEAKER_01  But like it reaches its nadir in 2002.
2139.08 2148.42 SPEAKER_01  New Year's Eve, two young women, two teenagers, teenage girls are shot dead in Birmingham, which is not a UK garage city, really.
2148.56 2153.60 SPEAKER_01  There was actually there's one banger called Girls Like Us, I think, by B-15 Crew.
2154.48 2155.46 SPEAKER_03  Don't want to do it, mate.
2155.78 2156.20 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, exactly.
2156.20 2159.14 SPEAKER_01  But yeah, this is tragic.
2159.34 2161.28 SPEAKER_03  I took you to the four by four, apparently what's went out.
2162.58 2163.36 SPEAKER_01  It doesn't, yeah.
2164.02 2166.16 SPEAKER_01  It does work weirdly for like grime.
2166.36 2169.04 SPEAKER_01  Like there are some decent Brummie grime MCs, but yeah.
2169.22 2170.22 SPEAKER_03  Said she was queuing for a taxi.
2170.36 2171.46 SPEAKER_03  She left all her money on the TV.
2171.70 2173.40 SPEAKER_03  Smort and sexy doesn't work as well.
2175.42 2176.26 SPEAKER_01  I can say that.
2176.30 2177.08 SPEAKER_01  My dad's from Birmingham.
2178.24 2180.34 SPEAKER_01  This is my part, mate.
2180.36 2182.64 SPEAKER_01  Don't want to be accused of anti-Brummies and racism.
2182.64 2183.80 SPEAKER_07  Am I wrong?
2184.82 2190.00 SPEAKER_07  Correct me, because another band that weirdly got sort of critical acclaim, but was completely inscrutable in America was The Streets.
2190.12 2191.10 SPEAKER_07  And this is later, I realize.
2191.24 2193.04 SPEAKER_07  Right at the end of this period you're talking about.
2193.88 2195.80 SPEAKER_07  That's not in any way related.
2195.92 2197.20 SPEAKER_07  Like that's some other kind of-
2197.20 2199.54 SPEAKER_01  No, that is kind of- No, he's a garage fan.
2200.08 2201.74 SPEAKER_01  And has it come to this?
2201.94 2203.06 SPEAKER_01  Has it come to this?
2203.12 2203.64 SPEAKER_01  Do you remember this?
2203.76 2204.28 SPEAKER_01  That tune?
2204.44 2204.72 SPEAKER_01  Okay.
2204.94 2205.40 SPEAKER_01  I'm not sure.
2205.76 2207.58 SPEAKER_01  I remember that first Streets album.
2207.58 2212.56 SPEAKER_07  I remember original Pirate Material getting a really high rating on Pitchfork and listening to it and being like, is this an elaborate joke?
2212.88 2214.88 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, no, that's sort of what I thought when I first heard it.
2214.90 2226.82 SPEAKER_01  Because I was like, this guy has like made a strange sort of more thoughtful, more like spoken word poet, white man's version of garage.
2226.96 2227.56 SPEAKER_01  I hate this.
2227.62 2229.56 SPEAKER_01  And then over time I've kind of come around.
2229.66 2234.62 SPEAKER_01  And I think there are people within the garage scene and within the grime scene who have loads of respect for Mike Skinner.
2235.04 2237.66 SPEAKER_01  I've really flip-flopped on him over the years.
2237.66 2240.00 SPEAKER_01  But he was a garage fan first and foremost.
2240.00 2245.42 SPEAKER_01  And like that original Pirate Material is his homage to Pirate Radio and UK Garage.
2245.74 2246.68 SPEAKER_01  It comes later.
2247.04 2247.30 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2247.40 2248.82 SPEAKER_01  Like all four, isn't it?
2248.82 2249.42 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, exactly.
2249.66 2253.04 SPEAKER_04  I was in Rotterdam recently doing a show at a comedy club there.
2253.04 2259.56 SPEAKER_04  And I realized like truly how, you know how the Dutch are just extremely weirdly plugged into Anglo culture, but specifically British culture.
2259.56 2263.94 SPEAKER_04  When I was sat in the bar of this club, like just having a drink and like sorting out my set.
2264.26 2269.12 SPEAKER_04  And then I just heard coming over the speakers, I think you are really fit.
2269.16 2270.38 SPEAKER_04  And I was like, surely not.
2270.78 2273.56 SPEAKER_04  I'm like, this would be a bizarre deep cut in the UK.
2273.82 2279.34 SPEAKER_04  Then I was just like, the thought of a Dutchman listening to the lyric, I stopped sharking for a minute to get chips and drinks.
2279.56 2281.66 SPEAKER_04  It was such a like arresting thought.
2282.04 2284.50 SPEAKER_01  I think, yeah, I was shouting out.
2284.72 2301.64 SPEAKER_01  So on my podcast, I have my friend Kasia T, Cursed Objects, in which we talk about, it's sort of a pop culture, academic adjacent, but fun sort of podcast, in which we sort of talk about objects that help us tell a story about kind of recent pop culture.
2302.40 2312.98 SPEAKER_01  Fit But You Know It came up actually as a lost banger, I think, because we were doing an episode about beauty and based on the welcome exhibition on beauty that's up at the moment.
2313.88 2316.34 SPEAKER_01  But what a British way of talking about beauty.
2316.96 2319.00 SPEAKER_01  You know, I think, yeah, you're fit, but don't you know it?
2319.16 2320.22 SPEAKER_01  Like it's like sock on it.
2320.22 2321.52 SPEAKER_04  So much of that song takes place in a kebab shop.
2322.16 2323.22 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, exactly.
2323.68 2325.26 SPEAKER_01  It is very quintessentially British.
2325.42 2327.88 SPEAKER_01  In fact, I think it's critical that it's come up on this episode.
2327.88 2336.48 SPEAKER_07  I just, I mean, all I can think of is, yeah, like encountering these things that have a significance that it's not immediately apparent if you're not from here.
2336.52 2342.62 SPEAKER_07  And certainly in my case, before I moved here, not having a ton of connection to it, the cover of original pirate material is an example of that.
2342.72 2345.80 SPEAKER_07  Like that's, if I'm not mistaken, it's like a council estate in Birmingham.
2345.80 2347.44 SPEAKER_07  And like, that's an evocative picture.
2347.44 2350.82 SPEAKER_07  But if you're not from Britain and you don't understand what any of that means, you're just like, oh, it's a building.
2350.90 2351.36 SPEAKER_00  You know what I mean?
2352.16 2358.94 SPEAKER_07  Similarly, that guy who does the imitation Bayou tapestries, but it's like illustrating the like fight at the kebab shop at 3 a.m.
2358.94 2363.98 SPEAKER_07  And like the hen do is walking by with enormous like penis helium balloons and stuff like that.
2364.26 2366.68 SPEAKER_07  You know, guys are fighting over an Uber or something like that.
2366.76 2368.82 SPEAKER_07  That it's funny on its face.
2368.90 2374.76 SPEAKER_07  But if you've lived in this country and gone out for a night out, especially outside of London, you have experienced all this.
2374.76 2378.66 SPEAKER_07  And so looking at this stuff, I guess I wouldn't have realized that that was an homage.
2379.06 2385.32 SPEAKER_07  I just thought I was like, my reaction as a 19, 20 year old college student was just like, man, rap music's weird in the UK.
2385.66 2385.84 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2385.84 2386.72 SPEAKER_01  What the fuck's going on here?
2386.80 2387.84 SPEAKER_01  That's a completely legit.
2387.90 2391.78 SPEAKER_01  I mean, I think that was my reaction to hearing it to the first time was like, man, rap music's weird here.
2391.88 2392.76 SPEAKER_01  What the hell is it?
2393.06 2395.68 SPEAKER_01  What is this man doing with his sort of strange beat poetry?
2395.68 2396.80 SPEAKER_07  Dizzy Rascal singing on Happy Talk.
2396.94 2397.52 SPEAKER_07  I'm like, what?
2398.20 2398.56 SPEAKER_07  Okay.
2398.64 2401.42 SPEAKER_01  This is not a bad song, but what in the fuck were they thinking?
2401.42 2406.86 SPEAKER_01  I mean, that period was, that was a period in which Dizzy also did a song with Shirley Bassey.
2407.04 2425.40 SPEAKER_01  I think like there was a real sense of like throwing anything you could at the wall in the late 2000s, early 2010s in the name of trying to like get a hit for like these guys who had produced so much amazing music that hadn't like, that the mainstream, the British mainstream music industry was just like not ready for at all.
2425.70 2437.74 SPEAKER_01  It really, it's weird in a way that it was ready for Garage because Garage came earlier and they found a way of making quite saccharine like UK Garage pop music that now everybody loves.
2438.16 2440.20 SPEAKER_04  Like Sweet Light Chocolate by Shackson Bigfoot.
2440.22 2441.20 SPEAKER_01  Sweet Light Chocolate, great example.
2441.60 2443.58 SPEAKER_01  Like Flowers by Sweet Female Attitude.
2443.82 2445.38 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, one of the all time Garage bangers.
2445.40 2455.32 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, which like I will hear at like birthday parties of people of all ages, like to this day, I could, you wouldn't be surprised to hear it in a pub, in a club.
2455.32 2462.08 SPEAKER_01  Like it's one of the very strange things about UK Garage that it was really controversial as a genre at the time.
2462.18 2466.28 SPEAKER_01  It attracted loads of political opprobrium, loads of sort of repression and racism.
2467.40 2479.00 SPEAKER_01  And then, you know, 15, 20, 25 years later, it's now just this sort of cultural product that everybody is proud of and in love with, irrespective of their age, seemingly.
2479.00 2487.34 SPEAKER_04  And I think it's something that feels, I mean, obviously it's like, it has so many origins in black culture, but it feels also something that's taken on like a much broader significance.
2487.64 2488.20 SPEAKER_04  A hundred percent.
2488.20 2489.50 SPEAKER_04  In a way where it's so beloved.
2489.82 2496.64 SPEAKER_04  Like I think like, grime even like in its popularity hasn't, doesn't have quite the same like broadness of appeal in the way that Garage does.
2496.70 2497.60 SPEAKER_01  You're totally right.
2497.70 2498.68 SPEAKER_01  There's a uniformity there.
2498.68 2507.58 SPEAKER_01  And there's, there's some really interesting stuff that goes on, I think around the late 90s, early 2000s in terms of like an articulation of British multiculturalism.
2507.78 2519.10 SPEAKER_01  So UK Garage, very much out of like black sound system culture of a lineage that goes through lovers rock and other kind of forms of reggae into jungle and drum and bass and then through to Garage.
2519.28 2524.92 SPEAKER_01  Like with jungle, garage, grime, like those are sort of in order and they involve a lot of the same personnel.
2525.80 2529.88 SPEAKER_01  But it's a very multicultural scene in which like the, some of the DJs are white.
2529.98 2533.52 SPEAKER_01  There's a lot of, there's some, a lot of South Asian people who get really into UK Garage as well.
2533.72 2542.60 SPEAKER_01  And when you interview, as I have done, like I did a series of articles about UK Garage 20 years on or so for the Red Bull Music Academy.
2542.90 2543.56 SPEAKER_01  God, RIP.
2544.48 2547.00 SPEAKER_01  When Red Bull were the only people paying us to do music journalism.
2547.20 2548.90 SPEAKER_01  Now there's nobody, by the way.
2549.10 2551.42 SPEAKER_01  That's why I'm not a music journalist anymore, but that's another issue.
2552.06 2561.22 SPEAKER_01  But yeah, Red Bull Music Academy paid me to do all these features in which I interviewed all of the kind of stalwarts of the UK Garage scene who are all older, even older than me and you know, like 50 odd, 55.
2561.64 2623.72 SPEAKER_01  And they, you know, they, they talk with just this beautiful like misty eyed kind of nostalgia about how, you know, a lot of people in the media and the sort of political class hated on us, but we were just working class people, black, white, Indian, who were coming together to have a good time and nobody, you know, it's a real like, they really idealized like that as a multicultural moment and so it's ironic that New Labour are trying to simultaneously in their first term also articulate like a positive, modern, progressive, you know, particularly before 9-11 in that moment between the end of history and 9-11, like, yeah, everything's going to be kind of great from now on, I think, and like, you know, we're past the dark days of the 1980s and we can celebrate, you know, our diversity and do so together and yet, like, New Labour absolutely hated Garage and the feeling was mutual and they, they tried to blame sort of every bit of kind of street violence on So Solid crew.
2623.94 2626.98 SPEAKER_01  In fact, I didn't finish that thought from before, so two teenage girls, There were a lot of them.
2627.22 2661.72 SPEAKER_01  There were, so two teenage girls were, like, murdered on New Year's Eve in Birmingham, huge, like, national outcry and sort of, you know, like, this is the straw that broke the camel's back, like, there's been so much of this but the response of New Labour is to blame So Solid crew who are not even from the same city or have ever been there sort of thing, like, Kim Howell's, one of the New Labour ministers, like, condemns, condemns So Solid crew as macho idiots who've been glorifying guns and are therefore, like, complicit in just, like, a random street murder that is in a, like, 200 miles away.
2662.38 2665.04 SPEAKER_01  Trevor Phillips, who is just,
2665.26 2665.64 SPEAKER_00  yeah,
2665.72 2667.64 SPEAKER_01  another popular figure, right?
2667.74 2673.20 SPEAKER_01  So he describes, repeatedly, like, he's like, I've got a word for music like that.
2673.28 2676.22 SPEAKER_01  It's all about gold chain and no brain.
2676.22 2678.14 SPEAKER_01  What a zinger.
2678.30 2678.72 SPEAKER_01  I know.
2678.98 2679.48 SPEAKER_01  What a zinger.
2679.68 2688.88 SPEAKER_01  But it really captures, like, this is the response from the establishment to this alternative kind of creative economy and kind of cultural blooming that's going on.
2688.90 2703.10 SPEAKER_07  It's interesting to me because there isn't an equivalent in America of a music product that was seen as sort of, like, black and therefore by association negative or pathological or despised or controversial that has now become universally beloved.
2703.26 2712.44 SPEAKER_07  Like, rap music is far more mainstream in America but it's certainly not universally beloved and I certainly think there's a lot of, kind of, like, white culture that exists in sort of opposition to it.
2712.50 2719.22 SPEAKER_07  Like, the joke about, like, the guy who says, I like anything but rap and country probably actually likes country music but refuses to like rap music for a different reason.
2719.62 2724.64 SPEAKER_07  But the only thing I can think of that was, like, controversial to this degree and is now universally beloved is The Simpsons.
2724.96 2728.80 SPEAKER_07  And people forget The Simpsons were, it was really controversial in America in the early 90s.
2728.94 2731.12 SPEAKER_07  Like, we were, as kids, forbidden from watching it.
2731.18 2734.20 SPEAKER_07  We weren't allowed, our schools wouldn't let us wear a Simpsons clothes, like, t-shirts to school.
2734.20 2734.62 SPEAKER_03  Wow, really?
2734.78 2746.86 SPEAKER_07  George Bush basically said that, like, President, the first George Bush said that, like, you know, there was a time when Americans, you know, culture, something to the effect of, like, kids should want to be more like, you know, the beaver from Leave it to Beaver instead of Bart Simpson.
2747.12 2747.14 SPEAKER_07  Like,
2747.40 2749.04 SPEAKER_01  it was seen as... And Homer's a bad dad.
2749.28 2749.98 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2749.98 2751.32 SPEAKER_01  It was seen as, it was seen as, like,
2751.32 2754.30 SPEAKER_07  it was teaching kids to be rude and disrespectful and so on and so forth.
2754.62 2755.94 SPEAKER_07  To say down with homework.
2755.94 2756.54 SPEAKER_07  To say,
2756.60 2756.92 SPEAKER_06  to say,
2756.92 2760.34 SPEAKER_07  you have my shorts and don't have a cow and stuff like that.
2760.64 2760.80 SPEAKER_04  Yeah,
2761.00 2762.96 SPEAKER_07  and if... I guess I would have a heart attack watching it,
2762.96 2763.24 SPEAKER_04  yeah.
2763.32 2767.68 SPEAKER_07  But I'm thinking also about... Hard work's very important to the development of children.
2768.36 2778.32 SPEAKER_07  Instances in which music is blamed for these things and all I can think of is the stuff in the 80s where, you know, basically heavy metal was blamed for teen suicide and things like that.
2778.32 2779.22 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2779.26 2788.36 SPEAKER_07  You know, and everybody got caught up in the net for that but one of the bands that really got caught up in the kind of, like, late 80s, Tipper Gore, Parents Music Research Council shit was Metallica because...
2788.36 2790.04 SPEAKER_07  But there were a bunch of other bands too that did.
2790.12 2790.86 SPEAKER_07  And Motley Crue.
2791.08 2793.96 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, yeah, but in Metallica's case I think it was...
2793.96 2802.02 SPEAKER_07  There were some songs that they had that were explicitly kind of about suicide or wanting to die and that got blamed but, like, it was a really weird...
2802.02 2809.52 SPEAKER_07  That kind of moral panic stuff was huge but the idea of blaming a specific band for a thing that's not...
2809.52 2810.46 SPEAKER_07  They have nothing to do with...
2810.46 2812.02 SPEAKER_01  For an open murder case as well.
2812.02 2812.72 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2812.78 2817.14 SPEAKER_01  The other thing, like, plausibly even the police were like, this is actually not helpful.
2817.14 2817.64 SPEAKER_01  The only thing I can
2817.64 2835.56 SPEAKER_07  possibly think of and this is very anecdotal and very kind of, you know, localized to my own sort of timeline of my life and experience is my parents just happening to have a subscription to Time Magazine and, like, two weeks before Columbine, Time Magazine effusively praising The Matrix and two weeks after Columbine blaming The Matrix
2835.56 2836.28 SPEAKER_06  for fucking
2836.28 2837.54 SPEAKER_07  Golubi. Yes.
2837.74 2839.08 SPEAKER_07  That is actually a good point.
2839.16 2861.78 SPEAKER_07  I realize Marilyn Manson and KMFDM somehow got wrapped up in the argument that they were to, like, and somehow inspired the Columbine killers because I think specifically KMFDM because they were more into them but Marilyn Manson was kind of the bet noire just because he was popular at the time but that's the only thing I can really think of is a random German industrial band inspired a school shooting in Colorado.
2861.78 2862.92 SPEAKER_07  And it's around
2862.92 2878.04 SPEAKER_01  the same time in terms of, like, Moral Panic over Marilyn Manson and then I guess the other, like, musical current we haven't talked about in the Anglosphere is New Metal which is also thriving at this time also involves baggy clothes.
2878.78 2880.50 SPEAKER_07  I had a pair of JNCOs, I remember.
2880.80 2892.76 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, there's not tons in common I would say otherwise except the fact that, again, you know, like Limbiscuit got a bit of Moral Panic-y stuff around Limbiscuit, yeah.
2893.40 2895.62 SPEAKER_04  Limbiscuit predicted 9-11 as we know.
2895.96 2896.30 SPEAKER_04  But that would
2896.30 2900.74 SPEAKER_07  say that that general vibe is extremely working class too.
2900.80 2901.18 SPEAKER_07  I mean, it's working
2901.18 2902.34 SPEAKER_04  class white culture in a
2902.34 2921.96 SPEAKER_07  lot of ways but, like, those bands are, I mean, I'm not going to say they're good but, like, both the fan base and sort of where those bands were coming from is, yeah, there's definitely like, it's kind of looked down upon by people because it's not, like, appreciably high culture or, like, high culture enough for popular music, if that makes sense.
2923.24 2924.10 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, 100%,
2924.10 2932.88 SPEAKER_01  and actually, can I jump in there and say, like, the, like, class, like, snobbery is a huge part of the controversy around UK garage to begin with.
2933.92 2947.94 SPEAKER_01  So there's, yeah, there's the kind of, the racism, the guilt by association because New Labour can't, you know, immediately sort, you know, sort out the social problems that have been left by 18 years of conservative government, and so they, and they're trying to do this sort of respect agenda.
2947.94 2949.22 SPEAKER_01  Blame, so solid, true.
2949.46 2964.58 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, yeah, so like, Tony Blair's, like, social authoritarianism comes out through this absurd thing I wrote about at length in my book called The Respect Agenda, which involves, you know, young people showing more respect and somehow, like, you know, all crime disappearing as a result.
2964.58 2971.32 SPEAKER_07  And if they don't, we've invented these speakers that play a high-pitched frequency that only teens can hear, and we'll put them outside as anti-teen devices.
2971.50 2975.78 SPEAKER_07  People, I've had American friends be like, this is a gag, right?
2975.82 2976.84 SPEAKER_07  Like, you're fucking with me.
2976.94 2978.70 SPEAKER_07  Like, this is an elaborate prank.
2978.76 2978.92 SPEAKER_07  I'm like,
2978.98 2980.54 SPEAKER_04  no, dude, these things, these are real.
2980.74 2981.70 SPEAKER_04  They're still around.
2982.46 2986.14 SPEAKER_04  Back in the day, we had the respect to gender, and nowadays, they just want to respect their gender.
2986.86 2988.74 SPEAKER_07  So, so, fuck's sake.
2989.06 2999.80 SPEAKER_07  So, New Labor, basically, Labor under Blair wins the general election with a massive landslide in 1997, and this, as you said, I mean, I don't know much about it.
2999.92 3017.88 SPEAKER_07  I didn't live through it, but having read about it, it feels like, yeah, the weird authoritarianism stuff becomes, and the weird kind of, like, fixation on, I don't know what you describe it, like, like, social control, or the idea that, like, the state should be, like, aggressively nudging, pushing for social control kind of things.
3018.00 3021.60 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, so, like, the ASBO, the anti-social behavior order.
3021.84 3022.40 SPEAKER_01  The mosquito.
3022.86 3023.18 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3023.54 3025.30 SPEAKER_01  That's the high-pitched device I'm talking about,
3025.34 3025.74 SPEAKER_07  is the mosquito,
3025.90 3030.80 SPEAKER_01  yeah. Yeah, so, exactly, things like that, like, loads of CCTV is being introduced in London at the time.
3030.98 3032.44 SPEAKER_07  Sort of, adulthood milieu.
3032.84 3033.84 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, completely.
3033.84 3039.08 SPEAKER_07  Which I saw on TV in the Dominican Republic, and it only had fucking Spanish subtitles.
3039.08 3039.70 SPEAKER_03  What bit of way?
3039.76 3040.98 SPEAKER_03  He has the only place to watch it.
3041.00 3049.84 SPEAKER_07  I didn't speak Spanish at the time, I now do, but I did in the time, and this is, I'm genuinely not fucking with you, I didn't understand half that movie because I didn't understand what any of the slang meant.
3049.88 3053.52 SPEAKER_01  Because I was that unfamiliar with, I think it's set in London, right?
3053.52 3055.82 SPEAKER_01  It's me watching The Wire for the first time with subtitles, yeah.
3056.32 3057.10 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, get paired up, yeah.
3057.20 3058.34 SPEAKER_01  This is very good, but what?
3059.28 3096.34 SPEAKER_01  So, yeah, the kind of, the atmosphere of general kind of New Labour's own version of social repression and conservatism that follows the major, John Major period, there's also just a general cultural snobbery towards UK Garage as cheap and nasty as something that, yeah, it's not been made with expensive equipment, like basically, and because it's working class, like multicultural culture, it gets treated with a lot of disdain by a lot of kind of media gatekeepers, including, memorably, the cover of the Melody Maker.
3096.52 3105.40 SPEAKER_01  So there were two, when I was growing up, there were two weekly British music magazines The Enemy and The Melody Maker owned by the same people, weird kind of cartel shit.
3105.42 3105.82 SPEAKER_01  The British media?
3106.00 3107.32 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, yeah, imagine.
3107.32 3107.58 SPEAKER_01  Anyway.
3109.02 3111.68 SPEAKER_01  And I used to buy both of them when I was sort of 14.
3112.88 3130.92 SPEAKER_01  At the absolute pinnacle of UK Garage's kind of chart crossover success with people like Craig David, they put on the cover a just like incredibly insulting parody of the Craig David cover artwork about the, and the, what's the headline?
3131.06 3132.24 SPEAKER_01  Like, I've just shown it to Nate.
3132.40 3132.82 SPEAKER_01  It's this,
3133.00 3144.38 SPEAKER_07  UK Garage, Garage My Arse, The Alternative Nation Fights Back, uh, 15 Garage busting alternative anthems by fucking Queens of the Stone Age is one of them.
3144.60 3145.22 SPEAKER_07  A perfect circle.
3145.22 3146.22 SPEAKER_04  A perfect circle.
3146.22 3146.40 SPEAKER_04  A perfect circle.
3146.40 3146.44 SPEAKER_04  A perfect circle.
3146.44 3146.70 SPEAKER_04  A perfect circle.
3146.96 3147.70 SPEAKER_07  Ah, great.
3147.84 3148.58 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, a perfect circle.
3148.80 3169.50 SPEAKER_07  For people who don't want super early 2000s ephemera, a perfect circle was a band formed by the lead singer of Tool and a couple of people in the kind of greater Tool slash Smashing Pumpkins orbit and I, they are not good but if you were in high school in 2000 and listening to alternative radio in America, you have heard a perfect circle.
3169.50 3171.00 SPEAKER_07  So the idea that that's being posited
3171.00 3173.68 SPEAKER_01  is the, So that's the alternative nation fighting back.
3173.68 3184.56 SPEAKER_04  It's also very funny given how much, you know, Craig David's Born to Do It is like one of the seminal British albums of like, you know, the early 21st century and we're a perfect circle and not a band you really ever talk about.
3184.82 3186.64 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, they haven't stood the test of time.
3186.64 3187.32 SPEAKER_01  No, not really.
3187.56 3202.36 SPEAKER_07  No, and quite frankly, the guy, the people who would be excited that, you know, was it Maynard from Tool has started a new band are probably socially, in general, regarded as more like the kind of people that of the same class that UK Garage fans would be in the UK.
3202.36 3206.00 SPEAKER_07  Like Tool is kind of, was always kind of considered like a burnout band.
3206.26 3206.50 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
3206.72 3223.80 SPEAKER_07  I mean like, and that's not, that's not to disparage the band or its fans, but like, they are absolutely a, like, like that, that occupies a social space kind of similar to this in America and they weren't massively popular in America in terms of like mainstream success, both because their music was weird, but also like because of snobbery, because of gatekeeping kind of stuff too.
3223.92 3224.06 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
3224.24 3224.70 SPEAKER_01  That's ironic.
3224.96 3225.06 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3225.16 3231.44 SPEAKER_01  So the, the idea, basically what this is reminiscent of more than anything is the disco sucks.
3231.44 3240.94 SPEAKER_07  I was thinking exactly, I was thinking of fucking disco demolition night at Comiskey Park in Chicago where they, they burn and it was like, wow, this is way more violent and homophobic than we thought it was going to be.
3240.94 3241.60 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, yeah, right, exactly.
3241.62 3250.14 SPEAKER_07  And then there was a huge riot when they fucking, they, they blew up a stack of records and it's like, yeah, because it's a bunch of white kids from the Chicago suburbs and they're like, we get to burn Donna Summer in effigy basically.
3250.36 3253.48 SPEAKER_07  It's so funny looking at that stuff now because you're like, but disco is good.
3253.60 3253.86 SPEAKER_04  Yes.
3254.00 3254.90 SPEAKER_04  Yes, exactly.
3255.12 3256.10 SPEAKER_04  Are you all insane?
3256.10 3268.38 SPEAKER_07  And the stuff that they're, you know, they're mad that basically the radio is playing disco and not fucking Aerosmith when they were, I mean, pop radio, FM radio in America was so much more segregated in 1980 than it is now and like, and it's still pretty bad in America now.
3268.44 3273.84 SPEAKER_07  And so it's just like, it was more of sort of like, gay people exist, black musicians are popular, stuff like that.
3273.94 3274.42 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, yeah.
3274.42 3276.80 SPEAKER_07  That kind of like, wave of reaction,
3277.30 3282.98 SPEAKER_01  I don't know. And they're reacting against something, I think there's something spiritually very similar between disco and UK garage.
3283.22 3289.50 SPEAKER_01  Like, it's about getting dressed up, it's about escaping from the like, economic woes and stuff of the society you live in.
3289.50 3291.92 SPEAKER_04  It has like a similar vibe musically, like it's quite,
3292.14 3292.88 SPEAKER_01  a lot of garage, shiny.
3293.40 3293.74 SPEAKER_01  Yeah,
3293.88 3299.16 SPEAKER_04  and a lot of garage is like kind of like, sort of, it's pretty listenable, like it's not like too challenging.
3299.36 3304.70 SPEAKER_04  Like some garage stuff is a bit more rough and ready than others, but like a lot of it has quite a like, a pop sensibility.
3304.92 3315.28 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, pop sensibility, hooks on the choruses, there's a lot of like, R&B samples that were used or like just straight up kind of R&B singers, you know, singing for the producers.
3315.28 3316.48 SPEAKER_01  A lot of it has almost a kind of like,
3316.54 3317.88 SPEAKER_04  northern soul type,
3318.00 3318.84 SPEAKER_01  like the kind of other people
3318.84 3320.98 SPEAKER_04  like Shola Amma and stuff. It's kind of like,
3320.98 3331.24 SPEAKER_01  yeah. Mystique and all these like, there was these sort of girl groups and stuff that, yeah, they're very, they're driven by choruses, they're really catchy, they're great for dancing to.
3331.34 3341.28 SPEAKER_01  There's a lot of similarities with disco and so the response of the kind of authentic rat, like I think the term that kind of some other music journalists use is rockist versus poppist.
3341.50 3341.74 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3341.74 3352.82 SPEAKER_01  So like, you know, people who fetishize, you know, a sort of double, triple album by Led Zeppelin that's going to be played in high definition like in, you know, on Blu-ray only or whatever.
3353.38 3358.96 SPEAKER_01  That's the alternative to this cheap and nasty, hunky, almost kind of genre.
3358.96 3386.06 SPEAKER_07  It's just interesting to me to think about it because, I guess because of the genre, because of the instruments, because of the styling, the dynamics of it, you have that split whereas I'm thinking of like because we didn't have this exact style of music and this sort of class implications, social implications of it, like the stuff that would be in my mind the closest would be the stuff that kids who would also be listening to Led Zeppelin because at least for people in my generation that was just like a thing like you had a wallet of CDs in your car, fucking, of course you had at least one Led Zeppelin CD in there.
3386.34 3392.90 SPEAKER_07  Like that's just a thing and that sort of opposition wouldn't necessarily have been there.
3393.06 3393.72 SPEAKER_07  But then if you-
3393.72 3394.58 SPEAKER_01  No, agreed. Sorry.
3394.86 3396.22 SPEAKER_01  But it's okay, but go please, yeah.
3396.46 3419.42 SPEAKER_01  No, I was just going to say that what's beautiful about the kind of that particular relic, the Melody Maker cover from October 2000 where they declare war on UK Garage in this, it's a real, it's a rear guard action because indie rock is sort of in the doldrums at that particular moment and the indie media, I mean, Melody Maker would close like a year or two after that, I think, from what I can remember.
3419.98 3427.82 SPEAKER_01  But what's ironic is that like something like Reading Festival where I went as a, you know, rock and metal and indie loving 14 year old
3427.82 3431.44 SPEAKER_04  and 15 year old. Who didn't go there as a teenager in the UK, truly?
3431.92 3432.16 SPEAKER_04  Sorry?
3432.32 3434.42 SPEAKER_04  Who didn't go to Reading Festival as a teenager in the UK,
3434.42 3444.38 SPEAKER_01  truly? It's vital, but it was, when I went in the 90s, the entire lineup is like, yeah, Queens of the Stone Age, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam.
3444.88 3453.38 SPEAKER_01  The lineup these days is like, I would say, pretty much 50-50 rap music, dance music on the one hand and then like bands on the other.
3453.80 3459.40 SPEAKER_01  So, the beautiful end to the story is that the alternative nation kind of had to cede a lot of ground.
3460.56 3461.62 SPEAKER_01  I wish I could give
3461.62 3466.62 SPEAKER_07  a better impression, but I genuinely don't know what it's like in America now with festivals and stuff like that.
3466.70 3478.68 SPEAKER_07  But I will say that like, there isn't as much of, we might call, genre policing in terms of what I've seen from like younger people and just music fans in general, but in terms of like how media and how radio work, it absolutely still is.
3478.98 3482.64 SPEAKER_07  If anything, it's just as strong as it was from what I can tell at least.
3483.22 3486.40 SPEAKER_07  And it's just interesting to me that this, I don't know, like, I think I've heard Craig David.
3486.68 3496.12 SPEAKER_07  That's probably the only, and I think I've listened to So Solid Crew because I remember hearing about 21 Seconds and the point being that there were so many members of the band that they could only be on the mic for 21 seconds if they were each, if they were going to make a radio single.
3496.66 3500.40 SPEAKER_07  I think I've listened to that if I remember correctly once just to be like, what is this thing they're talking about?
3500.90 3501.60 SPEAKER_07  But none of this, like,
3501.68 3506.44 SPEAKER_04  well, they were sort of like a workers collective, you know, were you Ashody, Lisa Mafia, or Romeo Dunn?
3506.48 3507.78 SPEAKER_04  You all got your 21 seconds,
3508.04 3517.94 SPEAKER_01  you know? I interviewed their manager for this series of articles I was writing about that period and he said they literally sat down and were like, okay, well, how long did the label want the single to be?
3518.00 3518.66 SPEAKER_01  Four and a half minutes.
3518.74 3523.88 SPEAKER_01  Okay, let's literally divide it by the number of MCs and that's how they came up with 21 seconds.
3524.56 3525.02 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, I mean,
3525.12 3528.30 SPEAKER_07  but basically every other song that you guys have mentioned, I have never heard.
3528.66 3529.36 SPEAKER_04  Every artist you've mentioned,
3529.36 3530.22 SPEAKER_07  I've never heard.
3530.40 3533.98 SPEAKER_04  Well, we should do the outtrain music this should be because this is a fun story for the listener.
3534.10 3547.64 SPEAKER_04  The way that I answered the door without Dan ringing the doorbell because I heard through his headphones through the door really loudly the harpsichord synth top line from Woman Trouble, one of the great UK garage bangers and I was just like, that's got to be Dan Hancock.
3548.08 3550.66 SPEAKER_04  That's not going to be someone randomly listening to Woman Trouble
3550.66 3553.64 SPEAKER_01  outside my door. Imagine, that's how I announced my arrival.
3553.98 3557.60 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, I guess I, I mean, yeah, I would be happy to put together a playlist.
3557.78 3558.76 SPEAKER_01  I would love that, honestly,
3558.76 3563.30 SPEAKER_07  and I know that a lot of this is kind of back and forth reactions and comparisons and so I know you've prepared a lot of notes.
3563.38 3567.56 SPEAKER_07  Are there some other like kind of highlights or things that you feel like are important for people to know about this just because?
3567.80 3590.56 SPEAKER_01  I mean, I want people to know that there were, in the heyday of UK Garage, they had a series of committee meetings that were a bit like when the five families sit down to decide the future of UK Garage and that was, because there's, I think we've alluded to types of UK Garage from, you know, different, different moments and different kind of strands within the genre.
3591.30 3615.08 SPEAKER_01  There was a real tension between the Aggie, MC-led, dark-sounding, much more kind of bassy stuff that's so solid crew, Oxide and Neutrino, and the kind of, the people that would go on to sort of semi-invent grime were making, and then the very sweet, loved up, kind of smart and sexy, disco kind of spirit stuff.
3615.90 3622.16 SPEAKER_01  You could be forgiven for thinking these were kind of different genres, but, so I think that's, that's one distinction that's important to make.
3623.08 3627.18 SPEAKER_04  Shanks and Bigfoot having a sit down with DJ Luck and MC Neat to decide the future
3627.18 3646.48 SPEAKER_01  of UK Garage. Yeah, they really, they were having, they were arguing, there were people from all sides of those, that subculture being like, we've got to make sure the older, kind of, more mature people who've been making it since the mid-90s were worried that the scruffy young oiks were going to ruin it by talking about Guns and Shanks all the time.
3647.48 3649.32 SPEAKER_01  And they, they really fell out over it.
3649.36 3655.56 SPEAKER_01  Like, there was a great divide and this attempt to heal it through, through, through a sit down did not, did not actually work.
3655.78 3658.10 SPEAKER_01  But I, I mean, I love music from both sides of that, to be honest.
3658.20 3659.94 SPEAKER_01  So Solid Crew debut album is very good.
3661.02 3664.00 SPEAKER_01  Otherwise, I just look up a lot of Todd Edwards mixes.
3664.54 3665.80 SPEAKER_07  I got to ask one last question.
3666.20 3679.86 SPEAKER_07  I feel as though coming at this from an outsider's perspective, that it seems like the advent of like referring to stuff as chav or chavvy in the early 2000s, late 90s, early 2000s, and this genre being popular seemed like they coincide.
3680.06 3681.34 SPEAKER_07  And I'm wondering if you could speak to that.
3681.52 3686.22 SPEAKER_07  I have, I kind of know from the things people have said online what is meant by that.
3686.44 3694.18 SPEAKER_07  But like, I don't really have the understanding of it because that comes from like encountering at the time on like the Something Awful forums when I was living in America.
3694.18 3699.88 SPEAKER_07  And then talking about people kind of reading the press here and how reactions to that.
3699.94 3706.64 SPEAKER_07  But basically chav being kind of like a pejorative stereotype of working class white people, if I'm not mistaken.
3706.98 3707.10 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3707.16 3709.26 SPEAKER_04  It reads, it reads later to me, chav.
3709.56 3713.40 SPEAKER_04  I associate it more with like 2005 than I do with like 2002.
3713.86 3714.10 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3714.32 3714.72 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3714.78 3739.16 SPEAKER_01  A little bit later, but I think there's a thread that runs through all of these things of like a generalized sense of snobbery and outright hostility, to be honest, not just snobbery, but like contempt and attacks from, you know, particularly the tabloids, but with support from New Labour ministers on working class youth culture at large.
3739.42 3748.50 SPEAKER_01  And so, you know, UK Garage, I would say, is sort of majority kind of black culture, but is very, very racially mixed.
3749.50 3753.12 SPEAKER_01  Chavs are generally, yeah, would generally be identified as white working class.
3753.60 3766.52 SPEAKER_01  People, young people specifically, but there is a thread that's common throughout that, essentially, which is that we don't like these people, we're embarrassed that these people are Brits.
3767.74 3770.72 SPEAKER_01  And the Burberry marketing department has got a lot of work to do.
3771.52 3772.00 SPEAKER_01  Exactly.
3772.36 3772.80 SPEAKER_01  Exactly.
3773.68 3776.72 SPEAKER_01  They were all treated badly by New Labour as well.
3776.96 3780.40 SPEAKER_01  Like, there was a ban on hooded sweatshirts at one point.
3780.44 3782.50 SPEAKER_01  There was a real moral panic around the wearing of hoodies.
3782.86 3783.48 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3783.80 3784.76 SPEAKER_01  And then David Cameron
3784.76 3786.06 SPEAKER_04  was going to hug you. He couldn't win.
3786.18 3799.90 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, well, exactly, David Cameron's offer to hug a hoodie was his attempt to signal that he was, you know, he was a left-wing Tory by Tory standards and a reaction against New Labour's authoritarianism, which seems mad now.
3800.18 3800.34 SPEAKER_01  Yeah,
3800.40 3814.40 SPEAKER_04  politics is so like this. I mean, we always say on this podcast that if anyone eventually legalises weed in the UK, it will be the Conservative Party because they'll just realise that it's like the perfect wedge issue, whereas Labour would be like, we could never be seen to be the party of legalising women.
3814.42 3817.32 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, yeah, yeah, only the Tories can go to,
3817.72 3818.86 SPEAKER_01  yeah, the weed shop.
3819.34 3821.22 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, yeah, yeah, only Nixon can go to China.
3821.22 3822.28 SPEAKER_01  That's what I was trying to do.
3822.52 3823.40 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3823.42 3830.32 SPEAKER_07  Only, look, I'm thinking just, just like bloodlessly who's going to be the next Tory leader and I'm just sort of like, only, I don't know.
3830.86 3832.08 SPEAKER_07  I want me to legalise it.
3832.54 3833.42 SPEAKER_07  Haldeman in Audible.
3833.74 3834.86 SPEAKER_00  They control the dispensaries.
3834.86 3837.80 SPEAKER_06  For fuck's sake, yeah.
3838.26 3853.84 SPEAKER_01  Maybe Chukumuna will come back because Chukumuna was a big UK Garage fan and it's, which breaks my heart slightly, but until I discovered that he apparently went off UK Garage when the MCs came in and ruined everything, I was like, yes, perfect.
3855.22 3858.14 SPEAKER_07  Well, all I guess we can say is, Dan, thank you so much for coming on.
3858.38 3859.08 SPEAKER_07  Absolute pleasure.
3859.44 3862.28 SPEAKER_07  Those out, I'm going to link to Inner City Pressure in the show notes to this.
3862.36 3864.08 SPEAKER_07  Please, I strongly recommend you read it.
3864.08 3864.68 SPEAKER_07  It's a great book.
3864.76 3868.66 SPEAKER_07  I learned a ton about grime and other genres leading up to grime in the UK and it's just a fun book.
3868.92 3869.66 SPEAKER_07  Genuinely, it's great.
3869.80 3871.06 SPEAKER_07  So, I would strongly recommend it.
3871.44 3872.50 SPEAKER_07  Thanks so much for having me, guys.
3872.50 3874.10 SPEAKER_07  And you said it was Cursed Objects was your show?
3874.10 3875.64 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, Cursed Objects, that's right.
3875.68 3876.92 SPEAKER_07  All right, we'll link to that as well.
3877.08 3877.24 SPEAKER_01  So,
3877.32 3878.92 SPEAKER_07  if you want to hear more from Dan, check that out.
3879.02 3879.84 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, check that out.
3879.98 3883.02 SPEAKER_07  And otherwise, thank you for being a subscriber and we will speak to you later this month.
3883.72 3884.62 SPEAKER_07  Absolutely, yeah.
3884.70 3885.90 SPEAKER_07  Don't forget to chill on Sunday.
3887.16 3887.48 SPEAKER_07  Right.
3887.84 3888.88 SPEAKER_07  Once again, inscrutable.
3888.88 3893.40 SPEAKER_04  You might as well have just been saying that in earnest.
3894.64 3896.36 SPEAKER_04  You might as well have a great weekend.
3896.68 3897.66 SPEAKER_04  Maybe that's me now.
3897.74 3899.70 SPEAKER_01  Maybe I'm just wishing everyone a chilled Sunday.
3900.20 3905.36 SPEAKER_01  I like the idea that you could have actually just done this entire podcast just in great Craig David Leroux and nothing else.
3905.50 3906.20 SPEAKER_01  Probably, yeah.
3906.20 3907.28 SPEAKER_01  I probably could have done it.
3907.28 3937.60 SPEAKER_08  I feel fantastic, fantastic, ecstatically astounded how a girl can really lose her brain.
3938.40 3942.46 SPEAKER_08  I feel surrounded, compounded, emotionally defounded.
3942.74 3945.22 SPEAKER_08  Did you think of anyone your game?
3945.60 3951.70 SPEAKER_08  Oh, you said that I have been gone too long.
3954.28 3959.06 SPEAKER_08  Don't try to tell me that I was wrong.
3961.78 3964.22 SPEAKER_08  Totally wrong for me.
3964.82 3968.20 SPEAKER_08  Got the hair in my face.
3968.94 3974.84 SPEAKER_08  Now I know the only thing to do is to give myself some space.
3976.10 3980.44 SPEAKER_08  I bet she never told you everything that drifted through her mind.
3980.88 3982.90 SPEAKER_08  All the secret thoughts.
3983.98 3988.28 SPEAKER_08  Well, I bet you never caught a slide in with another man.
3988.60 3990.02 SPEAKER_08  Such as I did.
3990.34 3991.12 SPEAKER_08  No, no.
3991.30 3994.02 SPEAKER_08  I hate to see the way the finger points at me.
3994.02 3995.70 SPEAKER_08  I bet fools.
3995.86 3997.08 SPEAKER_08  I don't think so.
3998.62 4002.98 SPEAKER_08  After all it said and done, girl, you know you had your fun.
4003.20 4004.86 SPEAKER_08  Why don't you leave it there?
