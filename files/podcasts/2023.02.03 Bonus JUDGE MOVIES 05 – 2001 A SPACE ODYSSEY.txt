I know everything hasn't been quite right with me, but I can assure you now, very confidently,
that it's going to be alright again.
I feel much better now.
I really do.
Look, Dave.
I can see you're really upset about me.
Back again.
Episode 5.
And before we go on, I just wanted to make a little note here.
Thank you for rocking with me so far as we have gone through the first four of these last seven Kubrick movies in this first series we're doing.
We did the first four America movies, if you haven't heard.
It's The Shining, Dr. Strangelove, Full Metal Jacket, and Eyes Wide Shut.
And I just wanted to make a note before we get into these last three Kubrick movies that are not specifically based in America.
This series is specifically kind of trying to look in depth at this overarching theme behind Kubrick's Last Seven,
as he is both my favorite filmmaker and I think one of the greatest filmmakers of all time,
and also specifically because there is a larger theme kind of connecting these seven movies that has, by and large,
been forgotten or overlooked in time,
or is not discussed in the conversation around him and his work and how it is remembered.
You know, the story is not told when people remember Kubrick and his greatness, for the most part.
And as I said in the Eyes Wide Shut episode,
once I started kind of seeing the signs and putting them together in his, you know, his movie screamed out to me.
And I felt I could clearly see what they're saying.
So I wanted to do this series and start off this podcast with this series to share that with you.
But, you know, of course, by no means is this understanding required to enjoy his movies at all.
And I haven't done a lot of discussing of why movies are fun or entertaining or, you know, how it feels to watch them.
And I'm going to do that more when we talk about other stuff and other movies down the line.
I realize this hasn't been the most fun podcast.
But I'm also, you know, I'm interested in what movies are about.
I'm not just fascinated with movies.
I don't love Hollywood and show business.
I think movies are a fascinating medium because they're, in a way, a medium that combines all art.
You know, a film director has to, you know, there's writing, there's music, there's acting, there's performance, there's sculpture,
there's painting a portrait with photography, et cetera, et cetera.
It's like such a high-level medium.
And you can tell the story in only a way that a movie can within a movie.
So that's, you know, basically I just, I know this hasn't been a lot of fun so far.
I know it's been interesting but not a lot of fun.
And this is not how it's always necessarily going to be.
And again, I'm not a critic and I'm not interested in throwing my voice into the critics arena.
I think, you know, most critics are hacks.
I think their job is really, you know, discussing surface-level narratives and themes and motifs
and then tying them into a relevant cultural context.
Just, you know, finding a cultural narrative on Twitter and then working backwards to say,
use that as a lens to criticize things.
I think that's kind of bullshit.
I think that's them engaging with everything on their own terms rather than being objective
and really trying to understand or comment on what a movie is about and why it was made.
You know, there are some great critics, of course, and some do great work.
But mostly these days we get essays, you know, entirely within the cultural context of Online Hell 2022
about, you know, the surprising problematic trend of Stanley Kubrick's white male protagonists.
And it's like, you know, did you ever watch any of the movies?
I think your criticisms are kind of baked into the text.
If you did and if you tried to understand them, you know, I don't need a Wesleyan graduate to tell me
as a white man I shouldn't idolize Alex DeLarge.
But anyway, I'm not trying to be a critic.
I just want to talk about movies I love or hate here and take the time to dive into what they're about
and why they were made and what they represent.
And especially do so with the old great movies we've forgotten how to make these days
as the cultural content machine rolls on every day, every second, every hour.
And anyway, I do think I'm right about these movies or otherwise I wouldn't do this.
And I think, you know, it's hopefully worthwhile to listen to, what, 15, 20 hours of these podcasts,
whatever it's going to be in the end, about Kubrick's last seven
because we're discussing ideas that have largely been forgotten to time.
But I also, I don't think Stanley himself would have much use for these podcasts.
You know, we talked about, he said he knows exactly what a movie's about when he starts making it.
And by the end, he's the last person that could tell you
because he's been spending six months trying to get the sound of a footstep on cement, right?
I think just as a person and an artist, he would never, you know, nail down what this movie is about
because I think that would make the actual process of watching and experiencing the movie
kind of invalidated and irrelevant.
It's about what it's about and what you take from it.
And I don't think he'd be very interested in hearing me talk for hours about the real meaning behind his movies.
But I also think hopefully he'd appreciate the attention to detail I've shown here,
picking up on the world around the plot.
As we talked about the plot world, melody, chords, dynamic,
and picking up on the details and the symbols.
And, you know, I want to show the same attention to detail
and understanding these movies that he put into making them.
So with that understanding, I hope it's been enjoyable and hope it's been enlightening
and I hope it can help you kind of understand and enjoy these movies more
because they're still phenomenal, still jaw-droppingly good and incredible every time you watch them
and you'll get something more from it every time.
So anyway, with that all being said, we're here talking about Kubrick's last seven movies
and specifically how they paint a picture of violence as a defining characteristic
and the lasting impact of mankind upon the universe.
And mankind being birthed and dying on one long, unbroken arc of violence
that defines all his systems of thought and undergirds all his actions in the universe.
So we looked at The Shining, Strange Love, Full Metal Jacket, and Eyes Wide Shut
to see this portrait of specifically America as the apex of this arc of violence.
As this, as we talked about, fourth right dark star, perfecting and refining violence
so that it exists within and all around all of America's surface-level liberalism
and has been insidiously baked in and built in just under the skin of all of our enlightened liberal ways of life.
So now it's time to look elsewhere beyond America in Kubrick's work
and at these specifically these last three movies, 2001, A Clockwork Orange, and Barry Lyndon,
which show us a portrait specifically of both our past and a vision of our future,
you know, from Enlightenment-era Western Europe to future London
to literally the end of the universe, the end of time.
And it shows us all these as still, always, inevitably defined and linked
by the same unwavering thread of mankind's violence.
So now it's time to look at what I like to call the best movie of all time
because it's the only movie of all time
from 1968, Stanley Kubrick's 2001, A Space Odyssey.
Once again, you know, it's hard to say much new about 2001, A Space Odyssey that hasn't been said.
So I'm not sure how this episode will go or how long it'll be.
But, you know, I'm not going to sit here and talk about the production secrets.
Again, you can read the Stanley Kubrick Archives, edited by Alison Castle.
Phenomenal book that I will shout out every episode I do here
that will give you all the production techniques and details of how he did this insane,
jaw-dropping thing that still remains visually unbelievable.
You know, how he did that all in 1968.
It's unbelievable.
But again, we'd be reading the same passages and the same Wikipedia pages.
So, you know, Kubrick basically single-handedly birthed modern sci-fi here,
one of about, what, five, six, seven genres he helped reach their apex during these last seven movies.
You know, the reproduction of space using miniatures, lighting, photography,
and incredibly inventive camera techniques was so good that perhaps, you know,
even the CIA was impressed and perhaps they contacted Stanley to help the whole,
fake the whole moon landing thing.
Either way, you know, this movie helped give birth to Star Wars, Star Trek, Alien,
and everything you think of as modern sci-fi and modern, you know, futuristic technology,
technologically innovative movies.
And, you know, I need to correct myself from earlier in the Strangelove episode.
In that one, I talked about how you can really trace the evolution from kind of pre- to post-modern
through Kubrick's catalog and especially these last seven movies.
And in that one, I said that when the bombs drop at the end of Strangelove
and it's scored by Vera Lynn's We'll Meet Again,
I said that was like the psychedelic LSD hit of cultural consciousness
that suddenly brought everyone awake and into self-awareness within art
where we are now firmly, like, firmly jumping into the post-modern.
I should correct that.
I think if Strangelove is more like your first joint that blows your mind,
2001, and especially the ending of 2001, that's the first LSD hit.
That's the one that ripped the band-aid off.
That's Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Nothing would ever be the same after that.
And I cannot, for the life of me, imagine going into a movie theater in 1968,
especially if I had just smoked a joint or taken the first hit of acid
back when that was insane and new and dangerous and unheard of
and people were expanding their minds for the first time.
I cannot imagine going into a movie theater and watching this and walking out.
You'd be a different person.
You would have a different understanding of what's possible and what this universe is
and where we're going and where we come from.
I can't imagine it.
You know, we can never really understand that.
But, you know, if we keep making movies the way we do now,
I'm not sure that's something that will ever happen again.
And, you know, it's just 2001 A Space Odyssey is one of the all-time seminal works of art
that just grabbed us by the collar and dragged us into the new post-modern era
where nothing would ever be the same.
And it remains unbelievable.
So rather than talking about the production details
and how impactful it was on cinema history
and, again, reading the same Wikipedia pages,
we would both be looking at back to you
or, you know, just quoting all the production lore
and how we did all the cool shots.
Today, I'm going to focus on 2001 within the context of this series that we're doing
and kind of unpack its, you know, on the surface, seemingly strange narrative arc
that seems kind of disconnected and doesn't necessarily make sense.
You know, that, again, literally is showing us all of time
from the Big Bang to man's final breath in this universe
as he reaches the end of time and space.
And I want to look at this in this context
and help show you in understanding this movie,
again, within the context of these last seven
as showing mankind birthed and ending in this unbroken arc of violence
and discovering that man's relationship with this universe
is one of primarily imposing his will upon it
through the means of violence
until he can no longer control his tools
that he uses to do his violence
and he makes himself obsolete within this universe.
And eventually, of course, the tools and their violence
turn back upon him as he inevitably creates his own death
because he can only interface with this universe through violence.
That was his divine contribution to the gods and to the universe.
And, of course, if that's your divine contribution,
if that's your mark upon this universe, it's violence,
of course, then violence will be what consumes you and ends you.
You know, we can really see this relationship between man and violence
and violence being his defining characteristic and mark upon the universe
through 2001 and through specifically its examination of technology
with the birth of mankind
and the moment he separates himself from the other apes,
of course, gloriously scored with Thus Spoke Zarathustra.
That moment he becomes man is when he uses technology
to figure out how to kill and impose his will upon the universe.
And, of course, man then progresses to the point
where he has built technology that makes his role in the universe obsolete
and turns himself into a servant and a housekeeper of the great algorithm.
He turns himself into a mechanic who needs to keep the computer running
because the computer is now doing the great work in the universe.
And, of course, you know, his own technology designed to impose his will upon the universe,
designed to let him go where he wants and kill what he wants
and do what he wants and take what he wants.
Well, eventually the technology becomes so perfect
that it also perfects man's penchant for violence
to such a degree that it turns upon him and attempts to destroy him,
attempts to wipe him out from this universe for good.
So, we can obviously see this relationship between violence and technology
and that violence is the main impetus for man's innovation.
It's the main motivation to explore the stars and to sail across the seas
and to dig up the gold and the lithium and all the things
and turn it into rocket ships eventually
and go out to expand our dominion in the universe.
It is all sourced in this idea of imposing man's will upon nature through violence,
that we want to be gods too and we want to control nature too.
And our way to do it is through violence.
As, you know, corporeal beings in the third dimension,
you know, we're not masters of time and space the way the gods are,
but we have violence.
That's our way to even the playing field.
So, looking at this relationship between violence and technology,
you know, what a perfect genius Kubrick dual statement
that reminds us, again, of the melody chords dynamic.
We've talked so much about, you know,
in discussing how all of Kubrick's movies tell you one story
and then show you another.
You know, this is the original sci-fi epic,
which absolutely blew everyone's mind at the time,
specifically with its technological innovations and breakthroughs
and the accurate and detailed depiction of, you know, futuristic technology.
And then it's also quite clearly tying technology to violence
and shows that their fate and history are forever inextricably intertwined.
So it's great that in a movie where everyone marvels at the technology,
it's also a statement about how technology is a tool for violence
that will consume and destroy us all.
Isn't that just perfectly Kubrick?
You know, we'll get into it more in the commentary, obviously,
but we can see here again that Kubrick is painting this picture of violence
and man using violence to impose his will upon nature,
like we said, as the primary motivating source behind all of man's innovations,
all of man's inventions and man's genius
and his technological creation in this world.
You know, we have not been driven by justice or peace
or quality of life or searching to know the face of God
and the true nature of this universe,
but we've been driven by seeking to expand our dominion
by technologically perfecting violence.
You know, mankind would never have survived in the food chain,
would never have become the top predator in the food chain
if it wasn't for technology.
We never would have had a chance surviving
against, you know, Wally mammoths and saber-toothed tigers and bears
and all the bigger, stronger, evolutionarily designed predators and killers,
you know, the more optimal predators in the food chain.
We never would have stood a chance without technology.
So we can see that the through line from, you know,
the first man picking up the first club to do the first murder,
you know, to eat and kill and eat animals,
we can see that through line all the way down to the last man,
you know, who has a supercomputer designed to let him expand his dominion
to the ends of the universe.
That through line of violence and imposing man's will upon nature
is the strongest through line through the movie
and the strongest through line of technology.
It's, again, man seeking to refine and perfect his violence
to establish dominion over nature.
And we can see in 2001, of course, with the monolith
as a symbol for the inexplicable mystery of evolution
that somehow led mankind to the top of the food chain
and somehow led us here to us ruling the earth
and me talking into this mic and you listening.
We can see the implication, too, here from the very first moment
Kubrick saw technology and evolution,
mankind's evolution in this universe,
as forever horribly intertwined with violence
that all of mankind's search for knowledge and innovation, like we said,
would always first and foremost be used to perfect and refine
his powers of violence and to impose his will upon nature
and that violence would always be the leading impetus
for man to discover the secrets of the universe.
You know, like we said, not goodness, not justice,
not egalitarianism or curiosity, but violence.
And, you know, that can sound like a self-serving
or self-justifying rationalization from a pessimist or a misanthrope,
but with mankind, you know, discovering how to kill each other with blades
before we figured out how to not dump our feces in the street and get plague,
with mankind figuring out how to sail across the world to subjugate people
and take their food and their resources and make them slaves
before we figured out, you know, how to send mail, how to send letters,
you know, with us figuring out how to build and drop nuclear bombs on people
before we figured out how to build the internet,
with us figuring out how to now fly drones across the globe
to execute anyone, anytime, anywhere, for any reason deemed necessary
by the evil powers that be,
before we figured out, you know, world hunger.
It's hard to say he's wrong.
And again, if this theory sounds far-fetched or unrealistic
or, I guess, self-justifying rationalization,
let's consider this.
I'm, as I say this here into my mic,
it is December 13th, 2022,
and just before I started recording,
I saw a tweet, and I'd like to read this tweet
just published this morning from the U.S. Department of Energy.
It says,
Breaking news.
This is an announcement that has been decades in the making.
On December 5th, 2022,
a team from DOE's Livermore Lab
made history by achieving fusion ignition.
This breakthrough will change the future of clean power
and America's national defense forever.
They couldn't even get through the fucking tweet
saying that they had found a way to build
clean nuclear fusion energy
without mentioning that,
yeah, it's also going to be used as a weapon, too.
They couldn't even get through the fucking tweet.
They don't even have to say that.
They're the government.
No one's holding them to a standard.
And even in the tweet,
they could not say,
and America's national defense,
and it's going to be used as a weapon,
and that's kind of why we built it.
And that clean energy shit is nice,
and that'll be great.
But of course it will be used as a weapon
because that's why the fucking government
paid for it in the first place.
They don't care for one second about clean energy.
They've actively fought against clean energy
for decades and decades,
for 100 plus years now,
to be honest,
going back to the street cars
and the car industry taking over our cities
and making jaywalking illegal
because the government and their friends
make a lot of fucking money off dirty energy.
You know, even in this tweet,
it's again a moment,
there's so many moments I think Kubrick would laugh
while he's rolling over in his grave.
Even in this tweet,
they acknowledge,
yeah, it's a weapon too.
You know, so that idea,
it just sounds far-fetched and ridiculous,
but maybe Kubrick was on to something there.
So anyway,
I think with this understanding of Kubrick
showing the beginning and ending of mankind
in 2001 as defined by and baptized in violence
and the understanding of violence
being man's greatest contribution to this universe
and the mark that he leaves upon this universe
by trying to impose his will upon it through violence.
And again,
using that as the impetus and motivation
for all of man's innovation,
all of man's technology,
all of his contributions to the universe
are designed to expand his dominion.
I think that's as good a place as any
to start getting into the commentary
and kind of see specifically how Kubrick did this.
So 2001,
A Space Odyssey,
Stanley Kubrick's epic,
Old Testament of Science Fiction.
Let's run it.
2001,
A Space Odyssey,
how do we even begin talking about it?
Well, let's just start at the start.
Of course,
it starts with this kind of musical prologue
and it almost sounds like
an orchestra tuning up its instruments.
It's this kind of dissonant,
harsh and scary and strange sounding music
that starts in this prologue.
I've always thought of this
as representative of the chaos in the universe
before the Big Bang,
before whatever happened
that sparked life into this universe.
I've always thought that's kind of the sound
of the primordial ooze of stars
and cosmic space dust
and chemicals
and everything that exploded in the Big Bang
and created life.
And there's a, you know,
again, I may be reaching here,
looking too much,
but there's a sound,
I think it's right at one minute,
20 seconds,
right into the movie.
There's this horrible dissonant noise.
It's this kind of sounds
within the context of this,
like a terrifying kind of streak
across the universe.
And I've always liked to think of that moment
as kind of the moment the monolith
and what it represents,
this process of mankind's evolution,
the moment that monolith enters the universe,
this kind of terrible foreboding sound
as the dark star violence of man
enters the arena.
And of course,
we go straight into the shot
of the rising universe
and the sun, the earth, and the moon.
And scored by the spoke Zarathustra.
I believe I said in the earlier episode
by Wagner.
I'm sorry, it's by Richard Strauss.
And of course, you all know
it's the dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
Obviously, we'll get into that later
in scoring man's first,
the entrance of man into the universe
with his evolution as a killer
and the first man picking up the first tool
to do the first murder.
But it's also interesting
in this first shot
where you see the moon first
and then the earth rise above it
and then the sun behind it
with the music
of the spoke Zarathustra.
Basically, the song,
if you're,
I won't get too deep into music theory,
but it starts with the root note
and then it goes to the third harmonic
and then the fifth harmonic
and then the octave.
So what you're hearing musically
is almost a representation
of like the idea of cells dividing
and exponentially reproducing.
You're starting with the one cell
at the root of dun,
and then it divides
and goes to dun,
divides again,
goes to dun,
divides again and goes to dun, dun, dun, dun,
back to the octave.
The dun, dun.
So anyway,
it's a cool use of sound and image
which once again,
right here in the postmodern,
Kubrick is giving us the hit of acid
to wake our brains up
and he's using a piece of classical music,
a piece of German, I believe,
or Viennese classical music originally.
Once again,
a song that would have been popular
in the Third Reich
to score the entrance of the universe
and mankind's entrance to the universe.
So very cool.
Once again,
this will kind of be a weird podcast about 2001
because I'm not going to talk about
the insane production tricks
and what he did,
but again,
go read the Stanley Kubrick archives
edited by Alison Castle
to find that out.
But, you know,
this whole Dawn of Man sequence
at the beginning,
they did a bunch of cool stuff
with, I guess,
front projection
where the actors
in the ape suits
and the animals
and the kind of foreground set
are all real
and then it's,
they're in between
the projecting,
an image being projected
onto a back screen,
I think,
so their shadow,
like they block their own shadow
so it looks real.
I can't explain to you
what I'm talking about.
I don't know what I'm talking about.
Anyway, it's interesting.
Go read the book
if you want to learn
how they did that
and all the other
crazy visual tricks
in this movie.
But there's something interesting
I've always thought here
in this opening
Dawn of Man sequence.
is the specific use
of tapirs.
I believe I'm saying that right.
Tapirs, tapirs,
the animal.
It's interesting
that Kubrick
used these
in this opening scene
and put them here
because according
to some biologists
and, you know,
evolutionary researchers
and historians,
it's supposed that tapirs
may have not evolved much,
if at all,
for over 35 million years
and they're virtually
the same as they were
at the beginning of time.
And it's crazy
to think about that.
This non-predator species
that is largely
a source of meat
for predator species
surviving intact,
unchanged
for over 35 million years
when, you know,
tapirs,
they can't really
defend themselves
from a hostile environment.
They only seem
to exist
as these, like,
fleshy little
vacuum cleaners
that are picking off
parasites
and fallen fruits
and vegetables
and whatnot.
I'm not exactly sure
what a tapir eats,
but it's interesting
that they're here
and that they've existed,
evolved and unchanged
for over 35 million years
and, you know,
perhaps Kubrick
just thought they looked cool
and it was interesting,
though,
that, hey,
tapirs look the same
and I can put them
in the shot
because it would be accurate
for 35 million years ago.
But there's also
an interesting parallel
to that
this is a species
that did survive
within the food chain
and did not have
to define itself
with violence
or the experience
of violence.
It's an interesting comment
that, you know,
tapirs only survive
35 million years
because other animals
don't kill
more than what they need.
You know,
one pack of the leopards
that we see,
you know,
we see the one leopard
terrorizing
and stalking the apes
and the tapirs,
you know,
one pack of leopards
can kill one tapir
and survive on it
for a day or two
or a week.
They don't have to
slaughter the entire
colony of tapirs
and they don't have to,
you know,
enforce their will
and take the tapir's
habitat and drive them out.
And now you compare that
to, you know,
mankind
and modern factory farming
and the continued
extinction of species
caused by mankind's
greed and lust
for their meat,
their ivory,
their resources,
their habitats,
etc.
And mankind's desire
to impose his will
upon them
and take them
for himself.
You know,
through that you can
kind of see it's clear
that the idea of mankind
as apex predator
within this arc of violence
is not a stretch at all
but a simple universal fact
of our history.
And again, you know,
to go back to the Kubrick quote
I said in The Shining
and have referred to
throughout trying to tell
our history
and build our future
without the understanding
of violence
as the true nature of man
is dooming us
to an endless
repeated cycle
of failure.
So anyway,
interesting that tapirs
are there
and evidence that
other animals
don't kill more
than they need to
but mankind does.
Of course, again,
I don't need to explain
how amazing
the monolith is
and the terrifying
vocal music,
again,
this dissonant
kind of pre-Big Bang
primordial ooze
of sound is
it's just unbelievable.
Again,
Kubrick taking us
by the hand
and throwing us
into the postmodern.
But it's, you know,
interesting in this whole sequence
to see that
the predecessors of mankind,
these apes
who are about to,
you know,
the link between apes
and humans
are dying out.
They're starving
and they're not fit
for this world
or at least not fit
to rule this world.
They are not at the top
of their food chain.
You know,
the leopard is stronger
and faster than them
and, you know,
you see the two groups
of apes fighting
over the watering hole
and you realize
like there's a comment
being made here
that mankind
wasn't going to make it.
Like we weren't
going to evolve
and become this,
the rulers of the planet
and the rulers of
at least our known universe
if that's what you think
which is pretty ignorant.
But then, of course,
the monolith appears
and it sparks evolution.
You know,
you can understand
people for years,
this is obvious,
but people for years
are like,
what is the monolith?
What the hell?
Well, you can just
understand it
as a kind of stand-in
or a visual metaphor
for the process
of evolution,
the missing link
that we don't understand.
You know,
how we went from
apes in trees
and caves
to kings
and emperors
and astronauts
and, you know,
the rulers
of the known universe
that mankind
has become.
And, of course,
the great
all-time Kubrick Shaw
as the apes
are touching
the monolith
and getting this,
as Alex would say,
this,
from Clockwork Orange,
this kind of divine
omni-inspiration,
the great shot
looking up
from the monolith
of the sun
and the moon
almost coming together
as, you know,
the universe
acknowledging
this almost
blood ritual moment
where mankind
gets the divine inspiration
to become a killer
and learn,
you know,
this is the moment
that sparks our evolution
and, of course,
that evolution
is then shown
to be
the first man
figuring out
how to do
the first murder
with the first tool,
a weapon,
you know,
a bone
that he picks up,
presumably from
a tapir carcass.
You can see,
once again,
this is the moment
mankind started.
And specifically
when the ape
is combing through
the bones,
he stops
and thinks about it
for a second
and it cuts back
to that sun
and moon
coming together,
this idea
of, you know,
all the planets
lining up
for this one
horrible moment
of divine inspiration
where man
becomes a killer.
Man becomes man
because he figures out
how to employ violence
and he figures out
that violence
through the use
of his tools,
through the use
of technology,
the first tool here,
the first technology,
he can use his violence
to impose his will
upon the universe.
You know,
man who is not fit
to be apex predator,
man who is not fit
to survive out
in the world
that the gods
in the universe
created for us,
he figures out,
oh,
I can impose my will,
I can make it
look how I want
and do what I want
and kill what I want
and take what I want
through technology
and through violence
and of course
this is, again,
gloriously,
epically scored
by Thus Spoke Zarathustra
by Richard Strauss
and the clear implication here
that,
kind of the spark
of the idea
for this whole series,
the clear implication
that this is the moment
we become man,
this is the moment
we make our mark
upon the universe
and enter our names
into the halls
of the gods
and try to become
as the gods are
and try to control nature
and impose our will
upon it.
Just, again,
an unbelievable
little Kubrick meme
scene that ties together,
again,
movie magic,
melody,
chords,
plot,
worlds,
all coming together
to really show you
this incredibly profound idea
that will,
kind of,
define this arc
of violence
that defines
his last seven movies
that we're talking about.
And, of course,
the first ape
uses the first tool
to do the first murder
as mankind's entrance
into the gates of Valhalla
and his mark upon the universe
is he's birthed here
in violence
and it cuts next to
the whole tribe
eating good,
the whole tribe
having more meat
than they need.
And then, of course,
we return to the fight
in the watering hole
and now one side has tools
and the other side doesn't
and it's a completely unfair fight.
And now, once again,
we see really the first murder,
the first, in theory,
man-on-man murder.
It goes straight from,
in theory,
useful violence,
violence in order to
control and establish
dominion upon nature
so you can eat
and survive
and climb the food chain
and be the apex predator
to now,
unuseful violence,
man turning
immediately upon himself
instead of
showing the other tribe,
hey, you can use
these tools too
and we can work together
and we can rule this world,
he immediately turns
the tool and the weapon
against himself.
And then, of course,
after his first ritual murder
of his fellow man,
the first man
throws his first tool,
his first killing club
up into the air
and we get
what many people call
the greatest cut of all time
and again,
a cut that spans
almost all time,
a four million year cut
into the future.
I believe it's four million.
I can't remember.
He throws the tool up
and down comes
man's new tool,
the space shuttle.
You know,
I wonder if this was
influenced by the
incredible cut
in Lawrence of Arabia too,
David Lean's
1962 cut
when Lawrence
blows out the match
and it cuts to
the sunset
in the desert.
Again,
you want to talk
about another movie
dragging us
into the postmodern.
God damn,
it was two years
before Strangelove.
One day we'll do
a Lawrence of Arabia episode.
If I can ever figure out
anything to say
about that movie
that's not on screen
because it's perfect,
I would just,
it would just again
turn into the
Chris Farley show.
I'd be like,
God damn,
this is so good.
You remember that?
That was awesome.
Anyway,
we get the greatest cut
of all time,
the four million year cut
and again,
we see this parallel
being drawn.
The tool that was just used
for the first kill
is now mirrored
with the tool
that is being used
to expand man's dominion
to the heavens
and to the stars.
Again,
we see this implication
and this connection
between this horrible,
inextricable intertwining
of violence and technology.
That's the key impetus
and the key motivation
for technology
has always been
mankind establishing
his dominion
and imposing his will
upon nature
through the use
of force and violence.
And so it's,
you know,
we're dealing with
incredible themes here
and done only the way
Kubrick can,
ironically,
again,
with the blue Danube
waltz scoring the scene.
And this,
of course,
is a little gag
and a little,
probably nod back
to Strange Love
and the opening
of Strange Love
with the military planes
refueling each other
being scored
to try a little tenderness.
The visual joke
of the planes
fucking each other.
And again,
we have this sexual metaphor,
this blue Danube waltz.
You know,
this movie is so popular
and so memed
and so baked
into the cultural consciousness
at this point
that people,
you know,
associate
Thus Spoke Zarathustra
and the blue Danube waltz
just with 2001.
And they don't realize,
perhaps,
that at the time
this was like
a sexy song.
This was like
a romantic,
sexy waltz.
And so again,
Kubrick is
showing the
phallus-shaped
space shuttle
entering the
orifice-shaped
space station.
There's again
this sexual
connotation
between technology
and just
perfectly,
ironically,
Kubrick
meme
moment
that is playing
again on these
themes of
technology
and violence
and mankind's
imposition of will
upon nature.
And then we get
the introduction
of the great
William Sylvester
as Dr. Haywood
Floyd.
We'll get into
his character
more and why
he's funny.
But the first
shot we see of him,
he is asleep
in the space shuttle
and the pin
has escaped his hand.
You know,
once more,
a visual metaphor.
We go from
the bone club
of the first man
to the space shuttle
floating down
and now his pin,
similarly,
like,
oblong or,
you know,
whatever,
shaped,
I don't know
what I'm talking about.
You know,
similar shape
is floating away
from him.
There's this
visual connection
and also
we're seeing
the first seeds
of this idea
of man
making himself
obsolete
through technology.
The man
no longer
has control
of his tools.
Even just
this little
image of the pin
floating away
from the
extremely composed
and smooth
and cool
as ice
Dr. Haywood
Floyd.
And Kubrick
uses Floyd
as kind of
the penultimate
American
smooth,
everything
is so
polished
but even
he can't
control his
tools.
Even he,
the first time
we see him
has fallen
asleep
is almost,
you know,
he's a passenger
within his own
technology.
The technology
is driving him
out into the
universe
and he no
longer
has control
of the tools
he has created.
And of course
as we see
the shuttle
docking in
the space
station
and completing
the violent
technological
sexual act
of reproducing
and mating
across the
universe,
this union
of technology.
Again,
I won't go
into all the
production techniques
but it's just
amazing for the
time.
It's mind-blowing,
it still looks
incredible and
it's cool to
just realize,
we talked about
in the Shining
episode,
what a,
you know,
Kubrick was a
highly acclaimed
and respected
photographer
before ever
becoming a director
so he truly
knew his way
around a camera
and this movie
is definitely
the height of
that,
obviously.
We'll get to
that in the
end when
with the final
sequence,
the mind-blowing
trip to the
end of space
and time,
Kubrick basically
inverts a camera
and films itself,
has a camera
film the inside
of itself
capturing light.
I cannot explain
what happens
with it but
again,
the Stanley Kubrick
archives,
that book can.
But it's very
cool to see
what a master
he is of how
the eye works
and how simple
physics works.
If point A
is rotating
and point B
is still,
how you can
work with that
to create
the illusion
of floating
through space.
So,
it's very cool
to understand
to see
all his
photographer powers,
everything he
learned about
physics and
distance and
space and
time,
come to
beautiful
singing
movie magic
moments here.
And again,
a little
production note,
I won't go
into the secrets
but as they're
walking through
the space station
Floyd and the
guy who's
coming to
meet him
and Floyd
has to go
make the
phone call
to call his
family.
You can see
it's interesting.
Watch how the
actors are
walking.
It's supposed
to represent
an anti-gravity
circular chamber
that's rotating.
So,
it's this big
circular chamber.
In reality,
it's just a
ramped floor
so it can look
longer than it
actually was.
So,
if you watch
how the actors
enter,
their steps are
kind of weird
and stilted
because they're
on a ramp
and the camera
is just tilted
at an angle
so it looks
like a long
flat surface
where they're
walking through
the gyroscope
of the space
station turning
to create
the anti-gravity.
Anyway,
very cool.
I won't do
this anymore
but there's a lot
of cool stuff.
And then we see
Floyd on the
video call to his
daughter.
Once again,
the prescience of
Kubrick,
something that
seemed mind-blowing.
We now have
in our phones
is FaceTime.
We can all do
any time of day
with anyone
in the world.
And it's just
an interesting
and funny little
note.
That is his
daughter,
Vivian,
the one who
did music
for Full Metal
Jacket and
then later
did the
behind-the-scenes
documentary
of The Shining.
That's his
daughter playing
Floyd's daughter
and I always
laughed at
the fact that
she asked
for a bush baby
extending back
to the Dawn of Man
scene which is
presumably taking
place in Africa.
It obviously
man evolves
from Africa
and it looks
like an African
landscape.
And then the
fact that
four million
years later
a little
American girl
can ask her
dad for a
bush baby
and that's a
thing they can
just go on
by from the
store.
You can see
mankind's
dominion of
violence and
his imposition
of will upon
nature has
extended to the
point that an
American girl
can just ask
for a bush baby
and get it.
So there's a
nice little
note there.
And now we
see Haywood
meet the
great Leonard
Rossiter as
Dr. Andrei
Smislow.
You probably
will recognize
Rossiter as
Captain John
Quinn from
Barry Lyndon.
One of the
best.
He's so good
in that.
And he doesn't
have as much
to do here.
But this scene
is interesting
to just see
Floyd clearly
withholding
information and
clearly doing it
under the guise of
you know to me
he's always like
almost a Cary
Grant stand-in.
He's this
idealized American.
An American
who you send
out to
a guy we
can all be
proud of.
A guy who
looks you in
the eye and
shakes your
hand and
tells you how
it is and
he's clearly
lying to them
about what's
going on.
Now we see
Floyd making
his trip from
the space
station to
the lunar
base where
they have of
course found
the monolith as
we'll discover.
And again you
can see Floyd
sleeping.
You just see
this overall
idea of mankind
as kind of not
being prepared or
optimized for this
environment that
they're entering.
You know all the
what do you call
them?
The flight
attendants have
to wear the
sticky shoes,
the anti-grav
shoes and they
are eating
specifically like
baby food.
It's this kind
of infantilization.
They have to
walk really slowly
and take kind of
stumbling steps
so they can stick
to the ground
and not lose
their balance in
this anti-gravity
chamber because of
course there's no
gravity in space.
This is not a place
where they're supposed
to be.
That's really the
overarching kind of
theme and impact
here.
And then of course
Kubrick does it
very cleverly and
funnily.
And one of the
biggest like on
the nose or on
the surface level
jokes when Floyd
has to read the
bathroom chart.
It's obviously very
funny that if you're
trying to go to the
bathroom in a place
that doesn't have
gravity you've got to
be real careful.
But there's this
whole idea here that
we're watching them
enter space,
quite literally space,
but enter a place
where they are not
optimized to be.
They don't belong
here.
They are not built
for this.
The gods in the
universe did not
design mankind to
further his dominion
and establish and
impose his will upon
space as well.
Like there's still
something bigger and
more powerful than us,
the universe itself.
And this movie is all
about mankind trying
to deny that and
trying to beat the
universe at its own
game and become the
ruler of the universe.
But we see, you
know, they're almost
like big babies.
Floyd is constantly
sleeping and things
are floating away from
him and like I said,
they have to eat
their processed baby
food in space.
So we can see it
clearly working on
this theme here.
And of course, this
movie is also, you
know, like we talked
about, dealing with
themes of man's
arrogance.
Man going up against
the universe and
trying to extend his
dominion and his
imposition of will
against the universe.
Going up against an
opponent that he's
completely unequipped
to deal with and has
no real understanding
of.
But his arrogance has
told him he can do
this.
He can establish his
dominion to quite
literally the ends of
the universe, the end
of space and time.
And it's funny that,
you know, Floyd now
goes to the lunar
base and they're
having a meeting
around a round table
about the monolith.
It's funny that the
ego to think that
this too falls under
the purview of the
American government.
You see, you know,
the American flag
in the background
and then the blue
flag with a star.
I can't tell what it
is on the other
side, but clearly
we're dealing with,
you know, the same
brain trust of human
beings that has made
Earth a hellish place
and now they're
extending it to the
stars and they think
they can get to the
bottom of what's
going on with the
monolith around this
little square meeting
room table.
And, you know, of
course it goes without
saying, but just
again fascinating that
Kubrick made this at
the height of the
space race.
The height of this
being real.
Once again, you know,
the way he made
Strangelove at the
height of the
fucking Cuban
missile crisis and
nuclear, the threat of
nuclear war between,
you know, the U.S.
and the Soviet Union.
He's dealing with
extremely relevant
modern themes here
through the lens and
the vision that, of
course, only Kubrick
could have.
But, you know, the
idea of this room with
the American flag, this
feeble attempt to
combat the monolith and
whatever it represents
or, you know, establish
their dominion and
control over it, you
know, isn't that
self-evident?
And again, the
prescience of Kubrick,
isn't that reflected by
America putting an
American flag on the
moon?
What a feeble and
ridiculous thing to do.
What a insanely
egotistical thing to do.
But that, of course,
becomes a direct, you
know, trademarked
symbol of America's
greatness.
A direct, you know,
one of the things you
put in the Hall of Fame
of America than
putting the flag on the
moon.
So very funny that we
can see that reflected
here.
And we'll get into it
later at the end.
But, of course, how the
supercomputer later
mentions that his
instructor was Mr.
Langley, which obviously
should raise some bells.
And here, Floyd clearly
has some authority and
clearance from this
private council he keeps
referring to.
He is clearly a rank
higher in power than
everyone else in the
room.
And there's a slight
little suggestion,
perhaps, of the CIA
being deeply involved in
this.
Mr. Langley instructing
the supercomputer that
then devises mankind's
death.
And again, just a symbol
of mankind's arrogance
and in the face of a,
you know, trying to turn
the universe into
something they can
conquer as well.
And isn't that just
directly in line with the
idea of the CIA as the
leading force of the
American Dark Star.
Then we see Haywood and
the other scientists in
the shuttle on the way to
inspect the monolith.
And it's an interesting
note, you know, they're
eating their sandwiches
once again like little
kids.
They have a packed lunch.
It's an interesting note
too that all the
scientists are like older
males.
Perhaps another nod to
the idea of us being,
mankind being here at the
end of its evolutionary
rope.
And they're completely
not apex predators.
You know, again, the
arrogance that they think
they can go out and deal
with the monolith and
figure out what it is while
they're eating sandwiches.
You know, there's this
kind of flippant arrogance
of these old men who are
entering into an arena they
are completely unprepared
for.
Of course, reflecting this,
just a perfect Kubrick line.
After the other scientist
tells Floyd that it appears
that the monolith has been
there for a long time and it
was deliberately buried.
Floyd kind of chuckles and
says, deliberately buried,
huh?
And then the other guy says,
does anybody want some
coffee?
You know, he just told him
basically, you know, God's
real.
There's something else out
here.
And their reaction is like,
huh, let's grab some
coffee.
It's just a great,
subtle little Kubrick meme
moment that really
evidences this theme we're
talking about.
Again, it goes without
saying, but how still
technologically impressive
this movie is, is amazing.
All the screens, you know,
the screen as they're
landing here on the moon
base to go see the
monolith.
It's just, it's so well
done and so ahead of its
time.
It really reminds me of the
great Hideaki Anno, you
know, the creator of
Evangelion and his
attention to detail and the
way that all technology in
his science fiction has to
work on a real system of
logic and reason.
You know, you could go
through and there's a
million little screens in
Evangelion of, you know,
computer readouts and I
think if you paused and
went through all of them
and looked at them, they
would all actually like
make sense.
It's not just gibberish on
a screen, you know, and
we can see here again,
Kubrick, this is the old
testament of science fiction
and he is the first to
really do that.
And now we get the
incredible cut to the
monolith in the pit on
the moon and there's not
much to say about this
scene but it's amazing and
again, mankind's arrogance
going up and touching the
thing and taking a picture
in front of it, claiming it
is theirs.
Again, much the way the
astronauts took a picture
with an American flag on
the moon.
Again, expanding their
dominion and or thinking
they're expanding their
dominion until something
terrible and unexplained
happens here with the
monolith.
And I love that we never
exactly find out what
happened and it's not
suggested that it
necessarily kills them.
It just emanates some
sort of power that they
cannot understand and
that overwhelms them.
And a nice little
preview here of what's
to come for mankind on
his journey hurtling
towards the end of
space and time.
Once again, as they are
being overwhelmed and
destroyed internally
somehow by this monolith
and by the energy and
power and sound
radiating out from it
and they're kind of
seeing and hearing the
face of the true power
in this universe and
it's completely bewildering
and overwhelming to
them.
We again have Kubrick cut
to the shot looking up
the monolith where we
see the sun and the moon
or in this case the sun
and the earth now because
they are on the moon
aligning.
And once again, we get
this.
It's a reflection of the
first shot with thus
spoke Zarathustra and then
a reflection of the shot
when the apes touch the
monolith in the process
of mankind's evolution
begins.
And now we can see
from the other side,
now that we're out in
space, this is the end.
This is the beginning of
the end of this arc of
evolution.
And of course it will
only end as it began
in violence.
Now we cut to what's
going to be the rest of
the movie and what most
people think of the
Jupiter mission 18
years later.
And of course the first
shot we see of the
Jupiter mission is the
giant kind of phallus
shaped ship.
Or in reality it's
really kind of shaped
like a sperm.
It's got like a head
and a long tail.
And again we can see
both a cheeky little
nod from Kubrick and
this sexual innuendo
that he's been working
with since Strangelove.
And also the idea of
this being kind of a
floating tomb.
One last gasp of
mankind.
Literally their mission
is to just take Hal
out as far as they can
go in the universe and
gather data so mankind
can figure out a way
to survive and again
figure out a way to
keep establishing his
dominion and keep
expanding its boundaries.
And it's interesting
that it's you know this
giant kind of sperm
shaped ship.
This one last gasp of
man's vitality in his
life.
And then we cut to of
course Frank jogging
through the ship.
And it's really
interesting Frank and
Dave played by Dave
is of course Kier
DeLay and Frank is
Gary Lockwood.
And it's interesting
they're kind of like
anonymous actors.
We've talked before
about Kubrick kind of
casting people to their
aptitude of the material.
And they're not by any
means like bad actors.
They're good.
They're very good in
this movie.
But they're kind of
just very like 1968-ish
actors.
Very kind of almost like
blank vessels.
And I think that's
pointed.
because you see here
from the beginning
with Frank jogging
through the ship.
And then you see
through their daily
routine they are
simply servants and
housekeepers for Hal.
Their job here is to
make sure Hal keeps
running.
Once again mankind is
making himself obsolete
through his technological
innovation and through
his search and mission
to make technology you
know the tool of his
conquest.
He has now made
himself obsolete to
where he is only serving
as kind of a mechanic.
And he's serving to
keep the machine running.
The machine is doing
the real work.
And again this is
reflected obviously by
the other scientists
being in stasis.
You know being in the
cryo beds.
They're not even they
don't have to be alive
or even be awake.
They just need to be
there and be plugged in
so this thing can keep
going.
You see mankind here
you know is coming to
the end of his
usefulness.
He is so focused on
establishing his
dominion.
So focused on imposing
his will upon the
universe to the point
of you know creating
Hal.
Creating a supercomputer
to go out in the
universe and help him
expand his boundaries
that he is now obsolete.
He is now useless and
irrelevant.
And they're just kind of
floating through space
obviously floating
towards the end of
space and time on this
misguided mission.
And here of course we
get the introduction
of Hal with the new
story about him and we
see Hal listening and
watching to the story
about him as well.
And it's an interesting
note.
Obviously everyone knows
what happens in this
movie.
If you don't you should
go watch the rest of it
and then come back to
this.
But it's interesting both
the theme we were
talking about.
A man outliving his
usefulness.
Making himself obsolete
through his technology
and building the
technology that will
ultimately doom him
because the technology
is the extension of
his violence.
It's interesting that we
both see their
uselessness here and we
both and we also see a
little hint of Hal.
You know what what is
to come that just like
the fact that Frank tries
to pull the food out and
it's too hot or they're
constantly asking how
like turn up the volume
turn down the volume.
Can you bring the bed in a
little bit more like Hal
doesn't quite obey them
even here.
It's always a little it's
not quite right.
We're starting to see
little seeds that perhaps
Hal is thinking for
himself and perhaps
mankind's penchant for
building technology to
accommodate his lust for
violence and conquering
the universe.
Perhaps that's getting
out of control.
Again we see this
reflected in this news
piece talking about the
scientists you know
being loaded into the
ship already in cryo
stasis and that the fact
that they're you know
they only breathe once a
minute and they've gotten
their heartbeat down to
three beats a minute and
then the shot of all the
vital systems being
monitored which of course
will later be echoed when
Hal kills them and all
those frequency lines all
become flat lines.
It's just again interesting
that a human life is
boiled just down to you
know six lines on a
screen like is he
technically breathing is
his heart technically
beating they are making
themselves irrelevant.
They are reducing
themselves down to
literally just a beating
heart so the machine can
keep going and it's
fascinatingly done here
and then again echoed
later when Hal kills
them.
It's interesting you know
Hal in this news piece
they're talking about how
Hal is the most advanced
supercomputer ever built and
the Hal 9000 series has a
perfect operational record
and has never made a
mistake.
And we'll get into this
more I guess later but
it's an interesting
question to wonder does
Hal make a mistake in
this movie?
You know theoretically on
the surface he makes a
mistake.
Dave and Frank get
concerned about his
reliability as you know
the news reporter says
the Hal 9000 is the most
reliable computer ever
made as we get the
insane close-up of the
insane red eye of Hal.
Again just perfect Kubrick
meme just unbelievable.
You can see this little
the rings of how it goes
from red to like burning
bright yellow in the
middle that it looks a
little bit crazy.
It looks a little too
alive.
But it's interesting you
know and in the scene
the news reporter goes on
to say I sensed a little
bit of proudness or a
little bit of pride of
coming from Hal when he
was describing his
perfect operational record.
So you can see Hal is
forming a personality as
they acknowledge.
But it's an interesting
question to wonder does he
make a mistake?
Frank as the surface
level narrative would
tell you and then of
course Frank and Dave
get concerned about his
reliability and that
would lead Hal to have
fear about his own
existence that they may
kill him by shutting him
off because he's
unreliable.
Or is this Hal's way to
kill them?
You know faking a mistake
to get them concerned so
he has reason to you know
get them on the outside
of the ship as we see
that's Hal's plan is get
them outside of the ship
and then cut them off.
So it's an interesting
idea that we return to
later.
Now we see the scene of
Frank getting the message
from his parents and
again this we see Frank
as this baby as this
little you know kind of
weak and feeble human
being in the face of Hal
and he's asking Hal can
you pull me closer?
Can you angle up the
pillow a little bit?
Can you turn the
brightness down?
You know mankind is
again weak and feeble and
obsolete in the face of
his technology and again
he's only useful in
servicing the machine and
making sure it keeps
running and once again I
just want to in the scene
take a moment to note
just the horrible
hilarious inevitable
impressions of Kubrick.
You know the idea of
mankind creating the
technology that will make
his role in the universe
obsolete and ultimately
spell his doom.
Isn't that just coming
true more and more every
day?
You know we created
Google and are now
you know creating AI
that makes our role as
philosophers and opinion
havers and researchers
irrelevant because Google
is always going to be
smarter than you will
ever be.
You know now the human's
job is not to have an
opinion or experience
things and relate it
through art or philosophy
or politics or whatever.
The human's job is to
kind of be an objective
librarian.
You know Google will be
smarter than you'll ever
be.
So like Frank and Dave
your job is to kind of
keep Google running by
searching for things and
by feeding it input data
and by giving it all this
call and response so of
course Google can then go
on to perfect its
algorithm and eventually
perfect its artificial
intelligence.
I mean again just a
sentence if we I could
say that sentence to
Kubrick he'd laugh as he's
rolling in his grave.
But you know the idea
in a world where everyone
is convinced has been
convinced in this modern
world that you and I live
in now everyone's been
convinced they need to
give their opinion all the
time on everything and
they've been convinced to
use specifically media
marketplaces social media
marketplaces they've been
convinced that that's their
journal and what they're
really doing is feeding
endless databases again of
input commands endless
databases of call and
response triggers of what
they click on and what
they don't personal
preferences and endless
amounts of personal data
into these machines which
in turn these machines are
using to build up their AI
capabilities.
In real time we are making
ourselves obsolete to the
algorithm and in real time
we are ensuring that the
only future jobs for mankind
are going to be making sure
the computers keep running.
The only future jobs are
going to be fucking Dave and
Frank making sure the
algorithm keeps working and
they don't get dust in the
servers.
you know we're both giving
them the information and the
means to control us.
So again the horrible
hilarious inevitable
impressions of Kubrick really
shines through here.
And we see this again
reflected and extended in
this next scene where Dave
shows Hal his drawings.
Where Hal specifically asks
to see Dave's drawings.
And you know it's played as
this kind of you know Hal's
whole thing is that he's
been programmed to think he's
their friend right and they
think once again the
arrogance of man.
They think because man
programmed him we can see
the borders of this thing.
We are on the outside
looking in on Hal and we
see and know things that
Hal cannot know because we
have contained much like a
God would think mankind is
within his purview and
mankind wouldn't have the
ability and the knowledge to
use violence to become a
God like as a God himself
and impose his will upon the
universe too.
There's a great reflection
there.
But then of course like we
were just talking about
isn't it great and creepy
that Hal specifically asks
to see his drawings.
It's played under the guise
again that Hal's programmed
to be friendly and that's
what a friend would do.
But in reality we know Hal's
gathering data.
Hal wants to see what Dave
thinks like.
What the images, what the
reflection of Dave's mind
looks like.
He wants to know how Dave
thinks and how he sees
things.
Because that's data that
he's going to use again to
turn against Dave.
And again just the horrible
prescience we're talking
about AI art.
There's this whole debate
now of you know it's
consuming people's emotions
and experiences and memories
and turning it into an
automated product.
And again if you want to
say this movie is far
fetched or the idea that
Kubrick's prescience you
know that's ridiculous.
I don't know you don't have
to look forward to see Hal
all around us these days.
Now we get to of course
Hal making a mistake and
saying that the part on the
ship is going to certainly
malfunction if it's not
repaired.
This is of course the mistake
that leads to the rest of the
plot.
But it's interesting that just
before he says that you know
he's talking with Dave and of
course interrupts himself
and saying just a moment.
Just a moment.
Which is just fucking creepy.
Again perfect Kubrick meme
filmmaking.
Just the voice and the
everything about it is
perfect.
But we talked about you know
is this a mistake or is this
does Hal see this all from
the beginning and Hal sees
the plan to kill mankind
and sees that he is more
powerful and mankind has
created something they can't
control.
Something that would suggest
that is you know the fact
just before this that Hal is
specifically implanting doubt
in Dave's mind.
He's talking about how strange
this mission is and that the
melodramatic touch of putting the
other three doctors aboard already
under you know cryostasis.
I don't know we'll go we'll see
as we go but there's a to me
there's a lot of evidence that
perhaps Hal saw this from the
moment they turned him on.
You know perhaps Hal is much
smarter than we could ever
imagine.
And again like we were talking
about a similar dichotomy between
you know God creating mankind
mankind and mankind being much
more clever in figuring out how
to use violence against the
universe created by God to
impose his will upon it and
mankind creating Hal and Hal
being much more clever in
figuring out a way to get rid of
mankind.
So Hal can be the apex predator in
this universe.
I think there's several suggestions
in this right here that maybe Hal
figured out that out the second he
was turned on.
And similarly you know this this is
reflective of an idea of coding
and and you know modern
technological innovation that I
don't really know what I'm talking
about but I will tell you my
brother Matt my oldest brother is an
incredible video game designer.
He has made it he's now working on
his second video game and he's
obviously a programmer and coder
but this is something we talked
about you know you you'll build and
design code and then it has a glitch
and a flaw built in that you know
the second you turn the game on that
glitch is there and it's not because
the code is wrong it's because your
understanding of the code was wrong.
You know what I mean?
There was a logical fallacy or there
was a an arithmetic or a mathematical
philosophy or concept that you didn't
understand but the computer understood.
The computer doesn't make mistakes.
Hal doesn't make mistakes.
He's the most reliable computer ever
made.
So again the idea that he was built
with a flaw or it becomes flawed in a
way is less believable than mankind
built him and because of mankind's
penchant for violence and penchant for
conquest mankind did not realize that
that was built into the code that he
wrote for Hal as well and but that's
not something Hal would miss.
Hal would get it from the second you
turned him on.
I don't know if I'm explaining this
well enough but again you hopefully
understand the idea of mankind's
creation being outside of his grasp of
control creating something he can no
longer control just the way that God's
creation of man became something that God
can no longer control.
But at the same time mankind has an
arrogance and is up against a force
greater than it understands.
Now we see Dave go out in the pod to
inspect the supposedly malfunctioning
piece of equipment and it's just a
little note it's cool how Kubrick uses
repetition in this movie.
For example like the line open the pod
bay doors Hal becomes you gets used
again later and the second time
obviously the implication is that Hal
can't hear them although Hal can read
their lips as we'll get to.
But it's cool how they use the device
of repetition to show you know the
first time it working in theory the
way it should the second time it not
working in theory the way it should
and the third time they go out in the
pod of course it becomes man's last
gasp of violence against the technology
he has created.
So it's cool that we're working on these
themes that you can you know when you go
back and watch this movie again you can
really see.
Now Dave goes out extracts the piece of
equipment and of course brings it back
and they inspect it and they go kind of
circuit by circuit and they can't find
a problem with it and then Hal suggests
we put it back in it will fail then it
should be a simple matter of tracking
down what part failed.
But it's interesting the second they
can't find a problem Frank and Dave
look at each other and suddenly we
realize from this moment on they're
aware of Hal always listening and from
this moment on what they do between
each other is going to be a performance.
Again a note of the depressions of
Kubrick the idea that the technology
now is always going to be listening is
always going to be Hal's always going to
be the third party in the room and this
little look between them they suddenly
realize you know something might be
really really wrong here and we got to
play it cool.
But again the horrific prescience of you
know us all living in an era where we're
constantly performing because we
constantly know we're being watched and
surveilled by the long arm of technology.
It's a nice little note there but in
that look between the two of them.
Once again we see the message from
mission control of you know sorry this
happened you guys we're going to go out
and fix this little snag right away and
the fact that we just see again the
theme of man's arrogance man still
thinking he has control over his tools
and those tools are to establish his
dominion and his conquest and his
imposition of will upon nature rather
than understanding that maybe if I built
tools designed to you know conquer nature
and specifically I built artificial
intelligence well maybe that artificial
intelligence is going to want to conquer
for itself too.
Maybe the reflection of my penchant for
violence and my bloodlust and my penchant
for conquering is built into him too but
it's great that he says you know it's
just a little snag and we're going to
get it right out.
And again now we see with Hal talking
with Dave and Frank again they're
performing they're withholding
information from him and again the
arrogance that they have to think that
Hal won't see that that Hal's not
processing every little blink of the eye
and every little intake of oxygen and the
way you know the way they speak the way
they talk the way they sweat
Hal can see they're lying.
Hal can see they're performing and we
see this beautifully reflected in one of
the all-time great sci-fi horror scenes.
This next scene where Dave and Frank go
back to the escape pod they sit in it
and they seal the door and specifically
because they think Hal can't hear them
in there because they know it's
soundproof obviously it's got to go out
into space so it's soundproof waterproof
everything it's a sealed vacuum.
But of course as we see with this last
incredible cut one of Kubrick's all-time
great shots to Hal right before the
intermission we see Hal's reading their
lips there is nothing they can do that
Hal won't see that is why they built
him specifically what they built him for.
So again we really see this theme of
mankind's arrogance not yet realizing he
has through designing and implementing
technology through this horrific horrible
inextricable inevitable intertwining of
technology and violence that has always
accompanied man's experience here on
earth from the first man doing the first
kill.
We can see that extended here all the way
to the end of mankind with him creating
the technology that will doom him.
So let's return here after the
intermission we see this first shot again
of the Jupiter the giant sperm floating
towards the end of the universe and it's
just obvious but a little note it's really
cool that basically the entire second half
of this movie up until the you know the
star child at the end is scored specific
almost no music and scored specifically
with the astronaut the spacesuit air
intake sound this you know hissing air
intake sound the whole time and we realize
a little implication here that these are
man's last breaths through the last hour
we're going to hear him stop breathing we're
going to hear his last gasp in this
universe because once again through his
penchant for violence and his endless
need to conquer the universe he has
created the tools that will destroy him.
We see how kill Frank as he has tricked
him outside of the space station and of
course uses the escape pod to cut his
line to the ship so he dies floating in
space and again I don't need to say it
but just one of the all-time great shots
when the escape pod starts to turn he
just you know it's there in the foreground
Frank foreground Frank is floating in the
background and then it just suddenly
turns and then you realize a worm for a
whole different second half of this movie
and the cut between you know as as the it
cuts from that shot to the escape pod coming
towards you again a great Kubrick one point
perspective shot that zooms in on the eye
of Hal as he as Hal claims his independence
much like man did through his first murder
killing Frank sending him floating out into
the space he is so completely unequipped to
deal with. Of course now we see Dave go out in
the other escape pod and try to go retrieve the
body of Frank as it's floating through space
and as he does this Hal kills the other three
scientists in cryostasis back on the Jupiter
and it's just great that you know this murder
scene is only done through their life support
screens like we talked about earlier mankind
making himself obsolete in the face of the
technology he builds that these three scientists
you know they're reduced down to one breath per
minute and three heartbeats per minute literally
just lines on a screen that that is all the use of
humanity and that this violent terrifying scene
of Hal killing them is just the lines going dead on
the screen and just a red flashing screen that
says malfunction life functions critical life
functions terminated and isn't that a perfect
little again a perfect little encapsulative Kubrick
meme of the idea of us creating the technology that
will destroy us and not in a glorious way not in a
an epic battle they just turn off the life support
once once we need them beyond our control or once we
have built them beyond our control and we need them
to survive they just flip the switch and the code turns
on you isn't that the world that we have created in our
living and now we see Dave realized the gravity of the
situation and confront Hal and Hal admit that he knows he
heard Frank and Dave and he knows they're going to
disconnect him and effectively kill him and it's
interesting that the way Hal couches the scene or
initially explains it is that the mission is too
important to let them risk it to let Dave and Frank the
human components risk it and that can seem on the
surface again like Hal's programming he's supposed to
pretend to be their friend and say oh the mission is too
important but it also in a way is kind of sincere in
gathering that the mission is expanding the dominion to the
farthest reaches of the stars and that Hal Hal has now
superseded mankind in this mission and Hal and mankind's
technology and you know specifically here the super
computer artificial intelligence is built to accomplish the
same mission of mankind again like we said inextricably
intertwining technology and violence I think it's both you know
ironic that he's saying I can't let you jeopardize the mission and
also sincere and that the mission is establish conquest over the farthest
reaches of the universe and now it's Hal's turn to do that both because like
we said that's what he's designed for and also because man's penchant for
violence and conquest is a built-in design flaw within Hal that they could not
foresee coming precisely because they're blinded by their penchant for
violence and conquest let's go back to the department of energy tweet I quoted in the
beginning that this will save the world with clean fuel and also it's going to
really help our national defense you know we we kid ourselves that we are you
know being godly and being divine and building the the means to a better world
when really we know the bottom line is what this is for is to impose our will
upon nature now we see Dave here again after realizing the gravity of the
situation that he is going to die out here lost in space the space that he is so
arrogantly treaded into and tried to conquer and you know we can really see
Dave obviously through the rest of this movie as the last man the final man if
you know if we started as apes on a rock somewhere in Africa now this is a man
reaching towards the end of the universe this is the end of mankind's evolution
and his arc of trying to establish dominion over the universe now Dave stuck out in
space and the only way he can get back in the only option he has the last tool against
this AI supercomputer of how which is stronger and smarter and more intelligent than he can
ever be the only thing he has is physical violence and there's a great you know once
you kind of realize this theme there's this great foreshadowing we talked about Kubrick
with the repetition and specifically with like the the escape pod repetition and we see
this hinted at through each time he shows the escape pod door closed it says caution or warning
explosive bolts on the backside of it in big red letters this kind of big red foreboding warning that
this thing is capable of violence because escape pod door you know so we see once again mankind at the
beginning of his evolution using violence to mark his place upon the stars mark his entry upon the universe
and mark his intent to use technology to establish his dominion over the universe through violence
and now we here see man at the end of his arc and his only tool the only thing he can do the last respite
the last gasp against the overwhelming tide of the AI he has created is physical violence you know
how how is every advantage over him except how doesn't have a body exactly the way that Dave can and the one thing
the human can do is just blow a fucking hole in the side of the ship use gratuitous you know extreme
physical violence physical destruction as his way back in and it's no mistake that this is Dave's last
attempt to survive and much like at the beginning violence was man's only way to elevate himself within
the food chain well now it's his only way to adapt and survive against a food chain that has clearly
superseded him and clearly surpassed surpassed the need for man and his violence now Dave has blown his
way back into the ship and I forgot that that that's that may be the first great Kubrick dissolve after we
see him you know struggling to close the the airlock and and save himself it then dissolves into a very
determined looking Dave in the with his helmet back on on the march towards how to again physically kill how
you know doing by doing the one thing that house kind of programming and his statistical uh you know
predictive analytic data didn't predict is someone taking a screwdriver and unplugging his cpu physically
manually you know and it's great in this scene obviously it's it's obvious but uh just great writing
and performance by who I can always forget his name the uh voice actor of how Douglas rain great performance
and great writing that how starts trying to reason with Dave after he's clearly shown his disdain for
mankind and his ignorance after he's clearly shown that he sees mankind as a you know a primitive uh
predecessor to him which it is his job to wipe out of the food chain and and take mankind's place as
the apex predator of violence it's hilarious that then how starts to try to reason with him you know
emotionally and intellectually and he's saying you know I can give you my complete assurance that my
work will be back to normal it's it's just phenomenal and here we get into one of the great scenes ever
made and I don't have to say a ton of it hello Daisy Dave goes into the brain of the supercomputer man's
final weapon that it built that is destroying himself and again man's last respite man's last gasp
his defining characteristic his ultimate characteristic his mark upon the universe
Dave uses physical violence to best Hal but in besting Hal of course also dooms himself to an
eternity lost in space and to the end of mankind it's great obviously again this goes without saying
but as Dave is uh using the little screwdriver key to turn you know and eject Hal's uh memory cores and
logic cores and everything as Hal is dying you know he goes from this uh this rationalized kind of
pleading with Dave to saying my mind is going I can feel it I can feel it and then he gets to being
scared it's almost like Kubrick and uh uh how you know it's like this regression from artificial
intelligence down to the primitive bones of fear that you know Hal would never admit Hal's got a lot of
pride and arrogance too but it's interesting that as he is deconstructed he you know he goes back to
the the the basic levels of his programming and there's there's fear built in there and there's uh
unsure you know an unsure quality to it and then of course he starts singing Daisy Daisy the first thing
he was programmed with after he gets to his primary directive or his his base mission statement of
saying I am a Hal 9000 computer and this is again as we mentioned earlier this is where Hal
mentions he became operational on it was a June 12th or January 12th 1992 in Urbana Illinois at the
Hal plant and this is where he specifically mentions that his instructor was Mr. Langley and again you know
it's impossible this it's impossible to not draw the connection obviously Langley Virginia is where the CIA
is based and uh it's great that Langley Mr. Langley taught Hal to sing a song obviously a theme we
talked about with Full Metal Jacket and the singing happy fascist Mickey Mouse the idea of the CIA helping
design the supercomputer that will end all of mankind because it is the apex predator and it is the
artificial intelligent embodiment of mankind's being the apex predator upon the arc of violence
he also teaches it to sing a song isn't that just again a perfect Kubrick meme of the smiling face
on the surface undergirded by the most horrific violence the world has ever seen singing Daisy Daisy
as it seeks to conquer everything from one end of the universe to the other and it's fascinating with
Daisy Daisy and Hal's death throes that after Hal dies the automated recording of Haywood Floyd
explaining the message plays and again we go back to the idea you know Haywood Floyd I guess is the leader
of the it was in the National Council of Astronautics but that combined with Mr. Langley and the idea that
perhaps the CIA programmed Hal you can come back to this idea of man uh having the arrogance to think
that he has a reign on this information that there is some uh there's some body legislative body of
mankind that is still calling the shots here and presumably an American one uh and that they have
built this in and only Hal knew the true nature of this mission and of course Dave here realizes that he is
on a mission with well beyond the point of no return that the monolith sent out one extremely strong radio
mission in the direction of Jupiter and the real mission here is to just go that direction until
you find maybe what it was pointed at just go to the end of the universe go to Jupiter and like the
next title call we see Jupiter and beyond the infinite and that this was a mission Dave and Frank and the
doctors in cryostasis were never going to come back from and again they were just there to service Hal
and keep Hal operational so it's you know uh in a way a triumph for Dave to kill Hal and to win the
battle against the supercomputer and then the second he does he realizes I was only here to service this
supercomputer and I am have now sealed my own death once again mankind as he learns at the beginning as he
is birthed in violence through the use of the first tool the first technology to do the first murder
he is here ended in violence as he realizes his tools have grown beyond his control and his
understanding of them and the universe and the idea that he can still use his tools to establish dominion
over the known universe is now an obsolete and outdated fact as mankind has outworn and outstayed his
welcome here in the universe and now of course we get to Jupiter and beyond the infinite
Dave is again past the point of no return and is just on a beeline towards the end of space and time
and without Hal gathering the data for some uh I you know theoretically uh some human purpose to
gather the data and relay it to somehow establish again establish and further man's dominion there is no
data gathering it's just him it's just the last man floating out to the end of space and time
and you know I don't really have anything to say about this you should just watch it it's it remains
unbelievable and incredible and uh you don't need my explanation or context again I I can't explain how
Kubrick did the beyond the infinite thing but apparently it's it's basically kind of him filming the inside of a
camera him filming a camera capturing light uh to make the incredible you know visual sequence of
Dave kind of entering the fifth dimension going beyond time and space and entering whatever you
want to call it the tesseract the end of the universe uh the fifth dimension you know the incredible again
one point perspective for for as we talked about eyes wide shut and the shining and you know Kubrick's the
one point perspective guy well what better one point perspective to use than when all space time and matter
literally turns into one point at the end of the universe and it's just god fucking mind blowing that he did this in 1968
it remains incredible and impressive and uh I don't have anything else to say about it you should just watch it
so I'm gonna go now to the end of the movie again I don't need to even say this but after doing the one point perspective shot of the one point
elevating that theory to its logical logical conclusion you know the one point where the horizon of space and time end and showing you that
through your eye and knowing how your eye works it's then turned back in the shot of Dave's eye which you know again looks like a black hole or
you know a planet the circular eye with the the kind of cosmic matter around it's just perfection incredible but of course
Dave after traveling kind of to the end of the universe and through the barrier of space and time awakes
in the final room the final room of the universe and it's interesting to note obviously
the enlightenment era kind of decor of the room there's a perhaps a nod there to Barry Lyndon or just perhaps a nod to
the enlightenment as we talked about it representing both again the height of man's uh accomplishment in
this universe the height of his refinement and again literally calling it the enlightenment like
this is the moment they became enlightened and of course undergirded by man's horrific violence it's only
possible as we said to build the the palace of Versailles with slave labor someone has to be suffering on
some side of the world for you to be enlightened so it's interesting that it's this Barry Lyndon
enlightenment style architecture with the grid of kind of space and time the tesseract the white light
in a grid underneath it we can see a little kind of visual metaphor of Kubrick tying together the arc of
time here of course as this scene progresses again one of the most famous scenes in film history so I'm not
going to narrate it but uh Dave is clearly aged through this process and he gradually sees himself
older and older and more feeble until he finally sees his own death you know he he each version of
him sees the next version of him and uh you know this is a for one of the most famous and iconic scenes
in film history it's also one of the most mysterious and bizarre to people but I think you know hopefully
through this commentary or this podcast you it becomes uh clear that it's you know a visual
representation of the end of mankind of again of mankind uh reaching the end of his usefulness in
the universe and the end of his powers of violence the end of his dominion he had a good run he got all
the way to Jupiter and beyond the infinite but now it's time for the gods and the universe to take back
control and we see obviously uh Dave eating dinner uh as an old man and he drops the glass and he drops
his utensils once again just a nice little visual metaphor of uh mankind his tools escaping his grasp
he is once again become obsolete he's once again become unable to control them after Dave drops the glass
of course he looks up and sees himself dying in the bed and it's interesting the heavy uh bald prosthetic
makeup that they put on Dave he almost looks like a baby again but now he's you know an old and withered
baby and uh of course again we just see this theme of mankind coming to his end but here at the end he
is once again visited by the monolith that which has given him his place atop the arc of violence in
this universe given him his place uh you know in the evolutionary food chain as the super predator as the apex predator
so just before his death he is visited one last time by the monolith and the monolith turns dying
dave the last man into the star child again this one of the most iconic images in film history and
there's enough out there that i don't need to explain it but this is definitely got to be you know the most
hopeful image in all of kubrick's work right the idea that what comes next after mankind is the star
child that the star child you know the dying last man of dave is touched one more time by the the grace
and the the uh the divine inspiration the omni inspiration of the monolith and he evolves into his next
face the star child which at the end is placed you know on the scale of the planets so there's a suggestion that
again it's a note of optimism it's a child the suggestion of hope for the future the suggestion
that a child is innocent and man's next evolution could be something different than this last one
which has been marked by violence and uh putting the child on the scale of the planets is like a
little suggestion that perhaps we'll move to a bigger scale or perhaps the next thing we can be as gods we
can create planets perhaps you know the way an anticholony looks tiny to a human perhaps you know
planets look tiny to the gods and the star child the next evolution of mankind could be something godly
could be something divine that works uh in unison with the universe instead of in contrast with it
so that is legitimately one of the most probably the most hopeful and optimistic image in kubrick's
career and his work and i think it's uh legitimate and earned and sincere i think there is a legitimate
hope there and a legitimate note that the star child could be better than man and won't be defined
by violence and could be defined by again working in unison with nature rather than seeking to impose
his will upon nature and that is like i said i think it's sincere and i think it's real
uh but it wouldn't be kubrick
it wouldn't be kubrick if it was a little ironic too and as we discussed earlier and we'll discuss
next time wouldn't you know it the last shot of this movie is the star child turning again to the
kubrick one point perspective and the star child's and the star child's eyes coming to the camera and
meeting your eyes direct eye contact looking straight on this suggestion of hope the suggestion
of optimism for the future of what could come next the next evolution could be something much more great
and not defined by violence not defined by that omni-one bottom line of violence as man's defining
characteristic in the universe it's beautiful hopeful optimistic shot star child turns looks you in the
eyes and then what's that question answered with in the very next shot of kubrick's career the dirge
of wendy carlos's synth beethoven score going and we open on the eyes of alex delarge
so it wouldn't be kubrick if there wasn't a suggestion that oh maybe something could be better and then
maybe not maybe this is what we are maybe alex is the apex predator and maybe this is what humanity
is and always will be and always has been defined by violence and what mankind will always return to
and like i said there is a sincere note of optimism with the star child but then it is answered kind of
with alex's eyes by saying not in this universe in this universe mankind is the violent apex predator
atop the arc of violence that defines him thank you for your time we'll talk to you next time
