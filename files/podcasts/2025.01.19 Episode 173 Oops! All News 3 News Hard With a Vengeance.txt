27.76 28.76 SPEAKER_00  what?
28.76 34.08 SPEAKER_04  I'm giving them that, you know? Like, maybe not a full pivot to video, but I like the little peek behind the curtain,
34.08 41.76 SPEAKER_01  you know? Maybe there's like a catch-up session, and like 30 seconds of our faces and then disappear again.
41.76 49.52 SPEAKER_03  I just realized that I'm sorting laundry right to keep and- God only knows what's behind me.
49.52 50.52 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, yeah.
50.52 52.08 SPEAKER_04  It's added here, folks.
52.08 55.52 SPEAKER_02  Pay no attention to the podcaster behind the curtain.
55.52 60.84 SPEAKER_04  I should never have gotten this blue screen covered in my bank details and all my passwords.
60.84 62.84 SPEAKER_04  Why did I do that?
62.84 68.16 SPEAKER_01  So I doxed myself live on a rail now like a few episodes ago when I like held up a thing.
68.16 71.28 SPEAKER_01  I held up my sacking letter from Sistra, which is here.
71.28 72.16 SPEAKER_01  Oh, with the address.
72.16 74.16 SPEAKER_04  And then- No, don't do it again!
74.16 75.16 SPEAKER_01  Obviously, I have the address on it.

142.92 145.92 SPEAKER_03  Uh, it was a- Hi, Valkshake.
145.92 147.92 SPEAKER_04  I wonder whether we just actually lost him.
147.92 148.92 SPEAKER_04  Can you hear me?
148.92 149.92 SPEAKER_04  It's possible.
149.92 150.92 SPEAKER_04  Is it even moving?
150.92 151.92 SPEAKER_04  Can you hear me?
151.92 154.92 SPEAKER_04  This would be the funniest possible time for this thing to cast out completely.
154.92 155.92 SPEAKER_03  Did he die?
155.92 160.92 SPEAKER_03  I'm going to kill myself and kill all of you.
160.92 161.92 SPEAKER_03  Okay.
161.92 162.92 SPEAKER_03  There he is.
162.92 163.92 SPEAKER_03  There we go.
163.92 164.92 SPEAKER_03  I was going to kill myself.
164.92 165.92 SPEAKER_03  Okay.
165.92 166.92 SPEAKER_03  Hi, I'm Liam McAnderson.
166.92 167.92 SPEAKER_03  My pronouns are he and him.
167.92 171.92 SPEAKER_03  And with me, we have, uh, not a guest for Victoria Scott purposes.
171.92 172.92 SPEAKER_03  Uh, yes.
172.92 173.92 SPEAKER_03  Very specifically.
173.92 174.92 SPEAKER_01  Uh, hello.
174.92 175.92 SPEAKER_01  My name is Gareth Dennis.
175.92 177.92 SPEAKER_01  Uh, my pronouns are he and him.
177.92 187.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, because you, you were talking to Victoria about whether or not these episodes, uh, sort of like count for total number of episodes guested in.
187.92 189.92 SPEAKER_04  And I think she still has the record.
189.92 191.92 SPEAKER_04  So that's obviously like, she does still have the record.
191.92 194.92 SPEAKER_01  So, so weirdly enough, you need to have me on more guys.
194.92 195.92 SPEAKER_01  That's, that's, that's why.
195.92 198.92 SPEAKER_01  That's what we, that's what we're going to stomach here.
198.92 200.92 SPEAKER_04  You need to have me on more.
200.92 205.92 SPEAKER_04  If you, if you've been watching the most recent set of episodes and you're thinking, wow, it's been a while since they've had Gareth on, you're right.
205.92 209.92 SPEAKER_04  You know, that's a counterintuitive opinion, but you're completely right.
209.92 210.92 SPEAKER_04  Completely correct.
210.92 211.92 SPEAKER_04  Yes.
211.92 212.92 SPEAKER_04  We will get on that.
212.92 213.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
213.92 214.92 None  Yeah.
214.92 224.92 SPEAKER_01  So Victoria in our eternal battle to hold the hot, the top spot, Victoria, she's winning and the, the, yeah, it's, it's the let them fight situation, you know?
224.92 225.92 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
225.92 227.92 SPEAKER_01  It's, it's a very violent battle between Victoria and I.
227.92 229.92 SPEAKER_01  There's, there's no love lost between us, you know?
229.92 230.92 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
230.92 231.92 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
231.92 232.92 SPEAKER_03  Fractious.
232.92 235.92 SPEAKER_03  Two podcasters enter, one podcaster leaves.
235.92 238.92 SPEAKER_04  What we really need to do is do an episode with both of you, you know?
238.92 239.92 SPEAKER_04  Yes.
239.92 240.92 SPEAKER_04  And then we can really settle this.
240.92 241.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
241.92 243.92 SPEAKER_02  It's going to be, it's going to be train versus car.
243.92 244.92 SPEAKER_02  All right.
244.92 246.92 SPEAKER_02  We're going to settle this for once and for all.
246.92 249.92 SPEAKER_02  Train versus, train versus plane also, potentially.
249.92 250.92 SPEAKER_04  Oh yeah.
250.92 251.92 SPEAKER_04  That's true.
251.92 253.92 SPEAKER_04  We've had Victoria on for like plane episodes before.
253.92 254.92 SPEAKER_01  Yes.
254.92 255.92 SPEAKER_01  Ooh.
255.92 256.92 SPEAKER_01  Now my brain is running.
256.92 258.92 SPEAKER_01  Anyway, we, what, why are we here?
258.92 259.92 SPEAKER_01  What's going on?
259.92 261.92 SPEAKER_01  What, what, what, what's the disaster in this lair?
261.92 262.92 SPEAKER_01  We are.
262.92 264.92 SPEAKER_02  We didn't, we didn't.
264.92 268.92 SPEAKER_04  Decades comprised of weeks where decades happened.
268.92 274.92 SPEAKER_02  I was about to say, this is, this is one of those, you know, once they elected Trump, the news started happening again.
274.92 275.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, no.
275.92 276.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
276.92 282.92 SPEAKER_02  It's been a while since we've recorded because you know, like everyone else, we didn't do any work between the holidays.
282.92 287.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, so, you know, we have families, you know, you may remember that of Gareth.
287.92 288.92 SPEAKER_04  And so it's true.
288.92 289.92 SPEAKER_02  Can confirm.
289.92 294.92 SPEAKER_04  So, um, we're doing another, oops, all news episode.
294.92 295.92 SPEAKER_04  Mm-hmm.
295.92 298.92 SPEAKER_04  I'm really hoping that we do this and then it just, there's no more news.
298.92 299.92 SPEAKER_04  No more news.
299.92 300.92 SPEAKER_02  In a good way.
300.92 301.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
301.92 303.92 SPEAKER_02  Not in a, like, you know, the news is over in a positive way.
303.92 304.92 SPEAKER_02  Right, right, right, yeah.
304.92 307.92 SPEAKER_04  What I'm hoping is, if Shadow of the Tomb Raider, yeah, I got you.
307.92 318.92 SPEAKER_04  After this, we get a decade where weeks happen, and it just kind of, like, oh, I'm so stuck for news entries for this episode, I dunno.
318.92 319.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
319.92 324.92 SPEAKER_02  I can't believe that, um, you know, Trump, you know, became a Zen Buddhist.
324.92 329.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, he's, he's up to the doctrine of Wu Wei, or non-action.
329.92 332.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, he's, uh, he has, um, he has found the middle path.
332.92 335.92 SPEAKER_00  We're all very pleased for him, yeah.
335.92 339.92 SPEAKER_04  Trump coming out with a shaved head and saffron rose.
339.92 342.92 SPEAKER_04  Siddhartha Gwattama Trump.
342.92 345.92 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, with the ear piercings, that would be nice.
345.92 347.92 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, yeah.
347.92 352.92 SPEAKER_02  So, uh, without further ado, let's do the goddamn news.
352.92 366.92 SPEAKER_02  So, this is a new one that just started today, or earlier today, or late yesterday.
366.92 367.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
367.92 369.92 SPEAKER_02  We're starting with a pretty grim one, to be clear.
369.92 370.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
370.92 371.92 SPEAKER_02  Like...
371.92 372.92 SPEAKER_02  Oh, most of them are grim, don't worry.
372.92 375.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, these are, there's not happy news in here, is this?
375.92 380.92 SPEAKER_02  Oh, no, there's one happy piece of news in there, but it's buried in there, don't worry.
380.92 385.92 SPEAKER_02  I mean, in terms of this one, I've literally been hearing from our listeners who are getting,
385.92 388.92 SPEAKER_04  like, evacuated, so this is, this is happening to, like...
388.92 389.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, hi, Noah.
389.92 392.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah. To, like, our people, this is...
392.92 393.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
393.92 397.92 SPEAKER_02  That was actually, I was up late on the phone yesterday, talking to Noah.
397.92 399.92 SPEAKER_02  More on that in a second, but yeah.
399.92 401.92 SPEAKER_02  Los Angeles has been destroyed.
401.92 402.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
402.92 403.92 SPEAKER_02  Had a good ride.
403.92 404.92 SPEAKER_04  Wildfires.
404.92 408.92 SPEAKER_04  Of the list of American cities destroyed by climate change.
408.92 411.92 SPEAKER_04  You know, very sad to have to add Los Angeles to it.
411.92 412.92 SPEAKER_04  Yes.
412.92 415.92 SPEAKER_01  Tampa's still avoiding being on that list somehow, after all.
415.92 417.92 SPEAKER_01  This is for full drugs in Tampa Bay.
417.92 421.92 SPEAKER_04  Divine Providence for the Tampa Bay Bucks.
421.92 422.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
422.92 441.92 SPEAKER_04  No, I, I mean, as far as this goes, this has been on the cards for a while, you know, like, and I think it had been, like, a sort of, like, a thing where, like, anytime you hear about Southern California's, like, increasingly losing battle with a biome comprised primarily of, like, dry tinder.
441.92 445.92 SPEAKER_02  With the invasive eucalyptus thrown in for good measure.
445.92 446.92 SPEAKER_02  Oh, those fucking koala bombs.
446.92 448.92 SPEAKER_02  Just some Australian koala bombs.
448.92 449.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
449.92 450.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
450.92 451.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
451.92 452.92 None  Yeah.
452.92 453.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
453.92 459.92 SPEAKER_02  But, yeah, so there are, I believe at this point, two or three fires burning in Los Angeles County.
459.92 468.92 SPEAKER_02  There is the Palisades fire that's down by the coast, just northwest of Santa Monica.
468.92 469.92 SPEAKER_02  Santa Monica.
469.92 470.92 SPEAKER_02  Pacific Palisades.
470.92 471.92 SPEAKER_02  Santa Monica.
471.92 472.92 SPEAKER_02  Santa Monica.
472.92 473.92 SPEAKER_02  Santa Monica.
473.92 474.92 SPEAKER_02  Santa Monica.
474.92 477.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, there's the other one, which I believe is the Eaton fire.
477.92 478.92 SPEAKER_02  Yes.
478.92 479.92 SPEAKER_02  Yes.
479.92 480.92 SPEAKER_02  That's, uh, that's sort of...
480.92 483.92 SPEAKER_04  I'm sick of hearing about which schools these fuckers went to.
483.92 485.92 SPEAKER_02  Don't threaten me with a good time eating.
485.92 487.92 SPEAKER_01  An Eaton fire would be marvelous.
487.92 488.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
488.92 496.92 SPEAKER_02  That's sort of northeast of downtown Los Angeles, near Pasadena, near Altadena, which is looking pretty ugly right now.
496.92 501.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, those are tens of thousands of acres between them are on fire right now.
501.92 504.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, and it has been, you know, pretty ugly to watch.
504.92 511.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, this is a really big fire and this is usually sort of the rainy, you know, wet season out there.
511.92 514.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, that sort of just did not happen this year.
514.92 517.92 SPEAKER_02  Usually the fires don't happen this time of year.
517.92 522.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, so it's been, you know, tough marshaling all the firefighters.
522.92 523.92 SPEAKER_02  It's been tough.
523.92 524.92 SPEAKER_02  I feel this.
524.92 525.92 SPEAKER_04  It's January.
525.92 528.92 SPEAKER_04  It's January and it's fucking like fire season.
528.92 529.92 SPEAKER_04  How?
529.92 530.92 SPEAKER_04  Fuck you.
530.92 531.92 SPEAKER_04  It's January.
531.92 532.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
532.92 533.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
533.92 534.92 SPEAKER_04  Genuinely.
534.92 539.92 SPEAKER_04  The one, the one silver lining of this, I hesitate to even call it a silver lining.
539.92 542.92 SPEAKER_04  Do you see that one venture capitalist guy who was, uh, tweeting?
542.92 545.92 SPEAKER_03  Can someone find me the private fire department?
545.92 546.92 SPEAKER_03  I'll pay any amount of money.
546.92 547.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
547.92 550.92 SPEAKER_04  Is there anyone I can like buy, like a fire department off of?
550.92 552.92 SPEAKER_04  It's like, fuck you, pay your taxes, you know?
552.92 553.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
553.92 558.92 SPEAKER_04  Seth MacFarlane drew a little, like, Brian Family Guy dog cartoon to thank the firefighters for saving his house.
558.92 559.92 SPEAKER_04  Oh, I just saw that, yeah.
559.92 560.92 SPEAKER_04  No, he didn't.
560.92 561.92 SPEAKER_04  Uh, he did.
561.92 562.92 SPEAKER_04  Looks like, uh...
562.92 563.92 SPEAKER_03  I don't want to see it.
563.92 569.92 SPEAKER_04  I think he said, thank you, LAFD, and that's a Los Angeles County fire department bulldozer there, so...
569.92 570.92 SPEAKER_03  Oh, yep.
570.92 571.92 SPEAKER_03  That's... yep.
571.92 572.92 SPEAKER_03  Yep.
572.92 573.92 SPEAKER_02  Yep.
573.92 576.92 SPEAKER_02  What you're seeing here is that when the first evacuation orders came down...
576.92 578.92 SPEAKER_02  You're seeing Ra's action in his bulldozer.
578.92 580.92 SPEAKER_03  This is his, folks.
580.92 581.92 SPEAKER_03  This is not like the nuke.
581.92 582.92 SPEAKER_03  This is his.
582.92 584.92 SPEAKER_02  This, this fire...
584.92 592.92 SPEAKER_02  The first evacuation orders seem to come from this, uh, this one development that's fairly high up in the mountains, and there's one road in and one road out.
592.92 593.92 SPEAKER_02  That sounds like...
593.92 598.92 SPEAKER_02  Then there's, uh, there's a second road that's blocked off most of the time.
598.92 601.92 SPEAKER_02  That's the quote, fire road, unquote, in case the main one is blocked.
601.92 613.92 SPEAKER_02  Anyway, they sent the evacuation orders out, and the, uh, the, the, the fire moves so quickly that the one road in was blocked, and so everyone had to get out of their cars and run for it.
613.92 619.92 SPEAKER_02  And then, of course, they couldn't move equipment in because the road was blocked with abandoned cars, so the fire department came in.
619.92 624.92 SPEAKER_04  They took the keys as well, just in case someone like stole your Nissan in the middle of the fucking fire.
624.92 625.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, the fire department came in with the bulldozer.
625.92 627.92 SPEAKER_04  If you wanted that badly, take it.
627.92 636.92 SPEAKER_02  I just, I would, I would point out, uh, you know, there's a big bus depot about two miles away by highway that could have moved people out in another way.
636.92 637.92 SPEAKER_02  Nah, fuck you.
637.92 652.92 SPEAKER_04  Well, I mean, conversely, like, a, a, a, a, a related part of, like, climate adaptation is gonna be maybe not building communities in places, uh, and in ways such that there's, like, one and a half roads out, and you can only get, like, people out by their own cars.
652.92 653.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
653.92 658.92 SPEAKER_02  All of the development in, in these parts of Los Angeles County, I think this is still Los Angeles County.
658.92 659.92 SPEAKER_02  It's pretty big.
659.92 660.92 SPEAKER_02  It might be like something to join it.
660.92 662.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, they got a county fire department there, so probably, yeah.
662.92 663.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, exactly.
663.92 664.92 SPEAKER_02  Probably.
664.92 669.92 SPEAKER_02  The thing is, there's a lot of this stuff where you talk about, like, the urban, urban wilderness interface.
669.92 674.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, these are houses which are, you know, they're single family.
674.92 677.92 SPEAKER_02  They're large houses on smaller lots.
677.92 682.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, and they're built, you know, with a bunch of dry vegetation around them.
682.92 683.92 SPEAKER_02  Mm.
683.92 689.92 SPEAKER_02  And they're built inside, they're built in areas that when, when the wildfire goes, uh, it goes really hard.
689.92 695.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, in this case, the one thing that's been exacerbating it are what are called the Santa Ana winds.
695.92 706.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, and these are the phenomena that happens, you know, uh, a dozen and a half times per year or so, where it's just like, okay, we have a night of 99 mile per hour gusts.
706.92 707.92 SPEAKER_04  Mm.
707.92 708.92 SPEAKER_02  Jesus.
708.92 709.92 SPEAKER_02  So.
709.92 711.92 SPEAKER_04  The Santa Ana where anything can happen.
711.92 712.92 SPEAKER_02  Like, uh.
712.92 713.92 SPEAKER_02  Exactly.
713.92 716.92 SPEAKER_02  And that, those peaked about two and a half hours ago as of now.
716.92 719.92 SPEAKER_02  Uh, this fire is still very much going as we speak.
719.92 729.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, this, the, the fire has managed to make it down the mountain and it looks like they just issued the first evacuation order for Palisades Park a few minutes ago.
729.92 735.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, and that's sort of past like where a lot of the vegetation is.
735.92 741.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, that's gotten into, you know, uh, uh, uh, Los Angeles bungalows proper.
741.92 748.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, yeah, that could, that could get pretty ugly, you know, even by the time this episode is finished recording.
748.92 749.92 SPEAKER_04  Oh yeah.
749.92 751.92 SPEAKER_04  I mean, the, this, the stuff moves so quickly.
751.92 753.92 SPEAKER_04  Um, I mean, yeah.
753.92 755.92 SPEAKER_04  And then it's really, it's really grim.
755.92 756.92 SPEAKER_02  That particular fire.
756.92 762.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, at least the winds are mostly moving out to sea, so you don't have necessarily the spread.
762.92 763.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, and then there's another one, the Eden fire.
763.92 768.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, that one there's, you know, probably a dozen miles of city between it and the sea.
768.92 776.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, they've been, there've been a couple of fires that have been, you know, started just from embers drifting three miles away.
776.92 782.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, which is pretty, not, not a good thing to think about, but those have been contained fairly quickly.
782.92 790.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, but the town of, uh, Altadena has already, you know, had pretty serious damage to its downtown.
790.92 797.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, you know, and again, that's past like the urban wilderness interface that's moving into proper urban.
797.92 800.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, so that's, that's also not so good.
800.92 812.92 SPEAKER_04  Um, it's just grim to consider that not only is this the kind of thing that's going to get worse every year for the rest of our lives, but the Chirons are going to become less and less like a joke every year for the rest of our lives.
812.92 813.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
813.92 814.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
814.92 818.92 SPEAKER_02  I was about to say, the other thing is, um, there's been a bunch of people complaining, Oh my God.
818.92 820.92 SPEAKER_02  Why did the, why did, why did the fire hydrants fail?
820.92 822.92 SPEAKER_02  Why is there no pressure in a fire system?
822.92 830.92 SPEAKER_02  You, you can't design a fire hydrant system, a high pressure water system for a demand like this reasonably.
830.92 833.92 SPEAKER_02  No, this is outside of scope.
833.92 838.92 SPEAKER_02  This is not something anyone could have reasonably predicted would happen.
838.92 843.92 SPEAKER_03  Scope creeper just to soak down the Rose Bowl with like a bunch of, uh, whatever the fuck is in fire hydrants now.
843.92 844.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
844.92 849.92 SPEAKER_04  It's just kind of like, why don't we build the whole town out of asbestos, which to be clear, they tried.
849.92 856.92 SPEAKER_02  So yeah, they're, they're largely, um, you know, in parts of, uh, the, the, the area that is currently being burned over.
856.92 863.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, they are, uh, without any fire hydrants, you know, you have to bring in water trucks and bumper trucks.
863.92 865.92 SPEAKER_02  Uh, the situation is not good.
865.92 867.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, climate change.
867.92 869.92 SPEAKER_01  I mean, this is, you know, there's not, this isn't just climate change.
869.92 871.92 SPEAKER_01  There are lots of other factors in here.
871.92 880.92 SPEAKER_01  Um, not that they're causing it as well as like it making the consequences worse, but you know, we, we've talked about it all before I've talked about in the book.
880.92 881.92 SPEAKER_01  It's talked about by a lot of experts.
881.92 891.92 SPEAKER_01  We're going to have to build, you know, we're going to not only build our new developments and new cities to be much more resilient and also move, you know, improve mobility.
891.92 904.92 SPEAKER_01  And so that you can actually get people in and out of areas, but there is so much retrofitting, particularly in U S cities that are so sprawling because the thing about the sprawling cities is that they are hopeless for putting in dense trans dense transit.
904.92 912.92 SPEAKER_01  You can do it, but they're not so good, but also they're really good for being obliterated by fire because you've got just lovely fire going through wrecking everything.
912.92 925.92 SPEAKER_01  I just, I've been working my way through on Google maps, looking at where the fires are and just looking at how perfectly arranged all the housing is between kind of pretty decent fire loads, uh, in the, in the kind of the brush as Ross was saying that interface.
925.92 930.92 SPEAKER_01  And the other thing is it's like Switzerland in this sense, some of these hilly stuff, it's like Switzerland.
930.92 934.92 SPEAKER_01  One road up except that in Switzerland, you'd have a rack railway down the middle of the road.
934.92 935.92 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
935.92 941.92 SPEAKER_01  So, uh, like there are ways to do this where you don't have everyone parking your car in the road such that they have to be bulldozed out the way.
941.92 943.92 SPEAKER_01  It's yeah.
943.92 952.92 SPEAKER_01  I think that the images of the bulldozing, bulldozing cars out the way, given that for the U S cars are up there with among the highest sources of greenhouse gas emissions right now.
952.92 956.92 SPEAKER_01  Um, it's yeah, it's, it's a bit like that photo from Spain the other day.
956.92 957.92 SPEAKER_02  Right.
957.92 961.92 SPEAKER_02  I think that's the way that and say in the United States cars are the highest and holiest form of life.
961.92 962.92 SPEAKER_02  That is true.
962.92 964.92 SPEAKER_04  I mean, that's kind of true.
964.92 965.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
965.92 970.92 SPEAKER_04  Like it's, it's like, okay, it's, it's gonna kill however many people, but it's gonna destroy God knows how many cars.
970.92 971.92 SPEAKER_04  What about my Nissan?
971.92 972.92 SPEAKER_04  You know, and that's the real horror.
972.92 973.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
973.92 974.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
974.92 979.92 SPEAKER_03  Coming off of my burning building holding Toby to, to save my, my Nissan Rogue.
979.92 982.92 SPEAKER_01  The thing is there are quite a lot of wide roads.
982.92 988.92 SPEAKER_01  Like you could have, I just, uh, pertinent to the, the, uh, the next episode, of course, I just finished watching Chernobyl series.
988.92 990.92 SPEAKER_01  I'm very late to that party, but I finally just watched it.
990.92 1002.92 SPEAKER_01  And one of the things that struck me, uh, in the early part is how quickly the Soviet union, um, and the, the, the Ukrainian SSR just rustled up like, like 200 coaches and just evacuated an entire city.
1002.92 1005.92 SPEAKER_01  Like that, that sort of thing can be done.
1005.92 1006.92 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1006.92 1007.92 SPEAKER_01  I was talking about a bus depot earlier.
1007.92 1008.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1008.92 1016.92 SPEAKER_02  There is a, there is a depot for the big blue bus, um, which is one of the local, uh, transit agencies in this area.
1016.92 1023.92 SPEAKER_02  A pretty big depot right in downtown Santa Monica, about two minutes travel time from where this bulldozer is.
1023.92 1034.92 SPEAKER_01  I mean, short of, short of like building better transit for the fringes of Los Angeles or Los local, like the, the city planners, you know, the county needs to be saying, do not drive your car.
1034.92 1039.92 SPEAKER_01  There will be co we have, we have an evacuation plan and it involves coaches plan that involves
1039.92 1042.92 SPEAKER_02  buses. I mean, you could have that organized for next season.
1042.92 1044.92 SPEAKER_02  You gotta worry about stuff like, okay.
1044.92 1052.92 SPEAKER_02  You know, personal possessions and pets and so on and so forth, but you want to, you'd want to encourage people to use the bus where possible.
1052.92 1053.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, exactly.
1053.92 1056.92 SPEAKER_02  So you don't wind up in this.
1056.92 1058.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, yeah, yeah.
1058.92 1059.92 SPEAKER_02  Oof.
1059.92 1062.92 SPEAKER_04  I like, I like the firefighter filming it on their phone.
1062.92 1064.92 SPEAKER_04  I was like, that's funny.
1064.92 1067.92 SPEAKER_00  Like, get the shot on Freud that you can.
1067.92 1068.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1068.92 1069.92 None  Like.
1069.92 1070.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1070.92 1074.92 SPEAKER_02  We got a statement from Noah, our Southern California correspondent.
1074.92 1075.92 SPEAKER_02  Yes.
1075.92 1077.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, hello from the climate crisis.
1077.92 1080.92 SPEAKER_02  There are over 27,000 acres of the county burning.
1080.92 1083.92 SPEAKER_02  There is ash falling all around my apartment.
1083.92 1085.92 SPEAKER_02  A mall developer who ran on being L.A.
1085.92 1087.92 SPEAKER_02  Trump is getting quotes in L.A.
1087.92 1088.92 SPEAKER_02  times.
1088.92 1102.92 SPEAKER_02  And our mayor cut the fire department funding by $20 million so that she could pay for exorbitant raises for the cops and LAPD staffing positions that remained completely unfilled for years because of how evil the LAPD are.
1102.92 1105.92 SPEAKER_02  This will happen to you one day.
1105.92 1106.92 SPEAKER_02  Great.
1106.92 1107.92 SPEAKER_02  I'll just jump in.
1107.92 1108.92 SPEAKER_02  I'll look forward to.
1108.92 1109.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1109.92 1110.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1110.92 1120.92 SPEAKER_02  That, that is another aspect of this is that a lot of emergency services other than the police have been recently defunded, not just the fire department, also things like homelessness services and stuff.
1120.92 1121.92 SPEAKER_02  Mm-hmm.
1121.92 1123.92 SPEAKER_02  All that went straight to the police.
1123.92 1125.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, and it's just padding the budget.
1125.92 1127.92 SPEAKER_02  It's not even paying for new officers.
1127.92 1134.92 SPEAKER_01  It's really good that you guys, it's like every other country that pays for a secondary paramilitary force ends up getting couped.
1134.92 1137.92 SPEAKER_01  It's amazing that it hasn't happened in the US yet, you know.
1137.92 1138.92 SPEAKER_01  It's got a ton.
1138.92 1139.92 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1139.92 1144.92 SPEAKER_02  Civilian control of the police is something that people really ought to be focusing on.
1144.92 1145.92 SPEAKER_02  I think we should work towards it.
1145.92 1146.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1146.92 1148.92 SPEAKER_02  We should work towards civilian control of the police.
1148.92 1151.92 SPEAKER_04  It's about building like, you know, strong institutions.
1151.92 1152.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1152.92 1153.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1153.92 1154.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1154.92 1155.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1155.92 1157.92 SPEAKER_02  But yeah, so that, that's an ongoing story.
1157.92 1159.92 SPEAKER_02  I mean, who knows what's happened by now?
1159.92 1163.92 SPEAKER_02  The whole city may have been destroyed by the time this, uh, this is released.
1163.92 1164.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1164.92 1165.92 SPEAKER_02  But yeah.
1165.92 1168.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, but, uh, anyway, uh, in other news.
1168.92 1171.92 SPEAKER_02  It's, yeah.
1171.92 1172.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1172.92 1177.92 SPEAKER_02  There was in New Orleans a mass running overing.
1177.92 1178.92 SPEAKER_02  Ugh.
1178.92 1179.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1179.92 1184.92 SPEAKER_04  It's just, it's, it's, uh, this is just a kind of like omnipresent feature of life now.
1184.92 1185.92 SPEAKER_04  Uh, it's a thing in Europe.
1185.92 1187.92 SPEAKER_04  It's a thing in the US.
1187.92 1212.92 SPEAKER_04  Um, and I mean, the thing I've, I've been talking about this a bit on, on trash feature and the thing that I come back to is that you just have a, a segment of the population who are so, who are like aware as everybody is that something is badly wrong and that something is, is fucked, but it like willing to be, or like, so like able to be led into the most incoherent self radicalizing positions based off of that.
1212.92 1213.92 SPEAKER_04  Um, oh yeah.
1213.92 1217.92 SPEAKER_02  Just, just, just insane political violence that doesn't make any sense.
1217.92 1218.92 SPEAKER_02  I mean, I don't know.
1218.92 1224.92 SPEAKER_02  You could learn by, uh, this guy, he, he, he, he did an assassination and left an elevator pitch memo.
1224.92 1226.92 SPEAKER_02  Everyone liked him.
1226.92 1227.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, you know, I don't-
1227.92 1234.92 SPEAKER_04  But that's, that's also an example of like incoherence because okay, when, when he killed the health insurance CEO, it's like, yeah, that was cool, fine.
1234.92 1238.92 SPEAKER_04  But like, he did it because he was radicalized by like Malcolm Gladwell.
1238.92 1239.92 SPEAKER_04  Right.
1239.92 1241.92 SPEAKER_04  You know, it's not something that doesn't make any fucking sense.
1241.92 1244.92 SPEAKER_04  The first, the first radical centrist.
1244.92 1245.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1245.92 1248.92 SPEAKER_04  And, and, and it's like, it's, it's deeply like individual and atomized.
1248.92 1251.92 SPEAKER_04  It's like a kind of more, especially for a guy like this, right?
1251.92 1261.92 SPEAKER_04  To be like, I'm going to join ISIS and then do a ramming attack off the back of like self radicalization is, it's just a kind of like more elaborate form of murder suicide.
1261.92 1262.92 SPEAKER_04  Right.
1262.92 1263.92 SPEAKER_04  Like instead of-
1263.92 1268.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, I don't think he even joined ISIS. I figure you got to like send in like a, some paperwork or something.
1268.92 1269.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1269.92 1270.92 SPEAKER_02  Pay an application fee.
1270.92 1271.92 SPEAKER_02  You know?
1271.92 1272.92 SPEAKER_02  Processing fee.
1272.92 1273.92 SPEAKER_02  Right.
1273.92 1274.92 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1274.92 1284.92 SPEAKER_04  But like, but like, because like part of the thing here was like, he was, he was like broke and he was getting divorced and he was unhappy about the divorce settlement if I remember right.
1284.92 1295.92 SPEAKER_04  Like, and it's like, this is the thing that I guess you do when you can't kill your like, soon to be ex wife and the rest of your family is you decide to take it out on like society in general in the form of Bourbon Street.
1295.92 1296.92 SPEAKER_04  But I mean-
1296.92 1301.92 SPEAKER_02  I think there's some interesting local politics here as well. Absolutely.
1301.92 1302.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1302.92 1303.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1303.92 1305.92 SPEAKER_02  So, you know, this is okay.
1305.92 1308.92 SPEAKER_02  Shamsa Din Jabbar, right?
1308.92 1310.92 SPEAKER_02  US Army veteran, American citizen.
1310.92 1313.92 SPEAKER_02  He rented off of Truro.
1313.92 1314.92 SPEAKER_02  Truro.
1314.92 1315.92 SPEAKER_02  Truro.
1315.92 1316.92 SPEAKER_02  Truro.
1316.92 1317.92 SPEAKER_04  Okay.
1317.92 1318.92 SPEAKER_04  I was thinking the city of Truro.
1318.92 1319.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1319.92 1323.92 SPEAKER_04  He rented, he rented off of this like, um, uh, West country city.
1323.92 1324.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1324.92 1330.92 SPEAKER_02  So, uh, he rented a Ford F-150 Lightning, that's the electric version of the Ford F-150.
1330.92 1332.92 SPEAKER_02  This thing's 6,000 pounds, zero to 16 in four seconds.
1332.92 1333.92 SPEAKER_02  It gives me like three seconds, yeah.
1333.92 1334.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1334.92 1337.92 SPEAKER_04  It's one of those things where it's an EV and that's useful for this kind of thing.
1337.92 1339.92 SPEAKER_04  This sort of thing specifically, right, exactly.
1339.92 1341.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, torque weighs a ton.
1341.92 1342.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1342.92 1350.92 SPEAKER_02  Turned right off of Canal Street onto Bourbon Street, dodged around a police SUV because they didn't have the wedge barrier there that day.
1350.92 1357.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, presumably all the other police crap that said Canal and Bourbon, because usually they get the portable sentry tower there and everything.
1357.92 1358.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1358.92 1363.92 SPEAKER_02  Uh, rams into the crowd on Bourbon Street, kills 15 people, injures a hell of a lot more.
1363.92 1365.92 SPEAKER_02  He had an ISIS flag on the truck.
1365.92 1369.92 SPEAKER_02  Uh, he rigged some pipe bombs to detonate with remote control.
1369.92 1375.92 SPEAKER_02  Never got to use them, probably because he crashed into the man lift here and then the airbag went off.
1375.92 1378.92 SPEAKER_02  And then he was stuck in there getting shot at by the police.
1378.92 1379.92 SPEAKER_02  Um.
1379.92 1381.92 SPEAKER_04  It's a pretty bad situation, you know?
1381.92 1383.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, not ideal, not ideal.
1383.92 1387.92 SPEAKER_02  Well, you know, if you don't want to wind up in that situation, don't do a truck attack.
1387.92 1388.92 SPEAKER_02  Don't do a truck attack.
1388.92 1389.92 SPEAKER_00  That's true.
1389.92 1390.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1390.92 1393.92 SPEAKER_02  You know, so this is about three blocks into Bourbon Street, right?
1393.92 1395.92 SPEAKER_02  Uh, this is, uh, what is it?
1395.92 1397.92 SPEAKER_02  I want to say there's a daiquiri place right up here.
1397.92 1398.92 SPEAKER_02  It is Bourbon Street, so, yeah.
1398.92 1400.92 SPEAKER_02  It also does pizza.
1400.92 1401.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1401.92 1404.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, I'm sure we've been there in the dead of night.
1404.92 1405.92 SPEAKER_02  No, it's absolutely like...
1405.92 1406.92 SPEAKER_02  It's absolutely like...
1406.92 1407.92 SPEAKER_03  The last time we were there, yeah.
1407.92 1412.92 SPEAKER_04  You're right for this kind of thing because you just have, like, a bunch of people, like, walking around very closely packed.
1412.92 1413.92 SPEAKER_04  Yep.
1413.92 1416.92 SPEAKER_02  Yes, this is a very, very narrow street, very heavy pedestrian load.
1416.92 1417.92 SPEAKER_02  It was New Year's Eve.
1417.92 1418.92 SPEAKER_02  Everybody's in and out of bars.
1418.92 1419.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, it's nasty.
1419.92 1421.92 SPEAKER_02  Everyone is fucking hammered.
1421.92 1422.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1422.92 1423.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1423.92 1429.92 SPEAKER_02  But anyway, so, one question is, if you've been to New Orleans, what's going on with the bollards?
1429.92 1434.92 SPEAKER_02  There's usually bollards blocking off Bourbon Street at this time of day.
1434.92 1435.92 SPEAKER_02  It's all right.
1435.92 1436.92 SPEAKER_04  It's all three o'clock in the morning.
1436.92 1437.92 SPEAKER_04  It's all bollards.
1437.92 1438.92 SPEAKER_04  It's all bollard posting at the end of the day.
1438.92 1439.92 SPEAKER_04  Yep.
1439.92 1440.92 SPEAKER_02  Always.
1440.92 1446.92 SPEAKER_02  So, Mayor Mitch Landrieu proposed closing Bourbon Street to traffic back in 2017.
1446.92 1458.92 SPEAKER_02  A bunch of business owners successfully opposed this because they get the majority of their business from the roughly 15 parking spots on Bourbon Street and not the, you know, trillions of pedestrians, right?
1458.92 1459.92 SPEAKER_02  Yes.
1459.92 1460.92 SPEAKER_04  Stupid fucking idiots.
1460.92 1461.92 SPEAKER_04  Correct me if I'm wrong, right?
1461.92 1469.92 SPEAKER_04  But isn't that whole area in the quarter kind of, like, de facto pedestrianized, but it also, like, occasionally gets cars through it?
1469.92 1472.92 SPEAKER_02  You can drive a car there.
1472.92 1473.92 SPEAKER_02  You shouldn't, but you can.
1473.92 1474.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1474.92 1475.92 SPEAKER_02  The sidewalks are very narrow.
1475.92 1477.92 SPEAKER_02  The streets are very narrow.
1477.92 1481.92 SPEAKER_02  Most streets are one travel lane, one parking lane.
1481.92 1482.92 SPEAKER_02  Okay.
1482.92 1486.92 SPEAKER_02  You know, it is built for the 17th century.
1486.92 1487.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1487.92 1490.92 SPEAKER_02  Back when you couldn't do, like, a self-radicalized horse attack.
1490.92 1491.92 SPEAKER_02  Right.
1491.92 1492.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, exactly, exactly.
1492.92 1494.92 SPEAKER_02  The horse gets scared by the other horses.
1494.92 1503.92 SPEAKER_01  I mean, just primarily, like, one of the most perfect, one of several of the most cities in the US, but possibly the most perfect city for being car-free.
1503.92 1504.92 SPEAKER_01  Dense.
1504.92 1512.92 SPEAKER_02  At least this section of the country, I think you could make a very strong case for pedestrianization, the French Quarter.
1512.92 1513.92 SPEAKER_02  I agree.
1513.92 1514.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1514.92 1522.92 SPEAKER_02  Now, to compromise measure here, meant to prevent exactly this kind of attack, were these movable bollards here.
1522.92 1523.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, we've got them in New York.
1523.92 1524.92 SPEAKER_01  They're stupid.
1524.92 1525.92 SPEAKER_01  That's fine.
1525.92 1526.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1526.92 1527.92 SPEAKER_04  They're also pathetic, right?
1527.92 1536.92 SPEAKER_04  Like, if you've seen in places that are sort of, like, designed against vehicle ramming attacks, and this does not always work, as we saw in Europe recently, in Germany.
1536.92 1542.92 SPEAKER_04  But, like, when you see, like, look at, like, the US Embassy in your country, if you're not in the US, for instance.
1542.92 1543.92 SPEAKER_04  Mm-hmm.
1543.92 1545.92 SPEAKER_04  Or, like, you know, parliaments or stuff like that.
1545.92 1551.92 SPEAKER_04  It might be in the form of, like, big planters or something, but you will have big concrete, like, fortifications.
1551.92 1552.92 SPEAKER_04  Right.
1552.92 1553.92 SPEAKER_04  You know?
1553.92 1554.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1554.92 1555.92 SPEAKER_04  It's not something that's implausible to put in.
1555.92 1560.92 SPEAKER_04  It's not something that's implausible to move in and out of the way a bunch of times a day.
1560.92 1563.92 SPEAKER_04  But, like, the little tiny, like, metal bollard just kind of doesn't cut it.
1563.92 1564.92 SPEAKER_04  You know?
1564.92 1565.92 SPEAKER_02  Oh, no.
1565.92 1567.92 SPEAKER_02  These guys are pretty heavy-duty.
1567.92 1572.92 SPEAKER_02  They're, like, crash-rated for, like, I wanted to say, like, 20 tons or something like that.
1572.92 1573.92 SPEAKER_02  I didn't write that down.
1573.92 1574.92 SPEAKER_02  Christ.
1574.92 1575.92 SPEAKER_02  These are called something...
1575.92 1577.92 SPEAKER_02  I don't know what I'm fucking talking about.
1577.92 1578.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, something like...
1578.92 1581.92 SPEAKER_02  The model name is a Matador or something, I want to say.
1581.92 1584.92 SPEAKER_02  That's the eviscerator.
1584.92 1585.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, exactly.
1585.92 1587.92 SPEAKER_04  That's not how a Matador works.
1587.92 1590.92 SPEAKER_04  The Matador's job isn't to try and absorb the ball.
1590.92 1597.92 SPEAKER_02  The Matador gets out of the way, right?
1597.92 1598.92 SPEAKER_02  Right.
1598.92 1599.92 SPEAKER_02  I don't know.
1600.92 1611.92 SPEAKER_02  So, anyway, these slide in and out diagonally, so that when the street is pedestrianized in the evenings, the ballers are up, but otherwise they are not, right?
1611.92 1618.92 SPEAKER_02  Otherwise, you know, you can get your deliveries early in the morning and people can drive their cars down the street until, I want to say, like, 8 o'clock in the evening.
1618.92 1619.92 SPEAKER_02  Something like that.
1619.92 1620.92 SPEAKER_02  Right.
1620.92 1621.92 SPEAKER_02  Congo bikes exist.
1621.92 1622.92 SPEAKER_02  You don't need vehicles for deliveries anymore.
1622.92 1624.92 SPEAKER_02  This is true, yeah.
1624.92 1633.92 SPEAKER_02  Um, so, this was the compromise measure, and this was deliberately, like, supposed to prevent truck attacks because everyone was terrified about the attack in Nice at that point.
1633.92 1634.92 SPEAKER_02  Right.
1634.92 1635.92 SPEAKER_02  Right?
1635.92 1636.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1636.92 1643.92 SPEAKER_02  And it was composed by Mayor Latoya Cantrelle to pedestrianize not just Bourbon Street but most of the French Quarter in response to COVID...
1643.92 1645.92 SPEAKER_02  Was also shot down.
1645.92 1646.92 SPEAKER_02  Wow!
1646.92 1648.92 SPEAKER_02  To the point where even wild traffic...
1648.92 1649.92 SPEAKER_02  Local businesses.
1649.92 1650.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1650.92 1653.08 SPEAKER_02  mild traffic calming was rejected.
1653.08 1655.08 SPEAKER_02  Come on, man.
1655.08 1657.08 SPEAKER_04  Just for clarity, for anyone watching...
1657.08 1665.08 SPEAKER_04  It's like a combination of bar owners and the kind of 15 ancient French vampires who actually live in the French Quarter.
1665.08 1667.08 SPEAKER_02  This is a photo...
1667.08 1670.44 SPEAKER_04  Fucking Delphine Lalaurie's ghost sticking that shit up on the front door.
1670.44 1676.84 SPEAKER_02  This is a photo I took on Bourbon Street several years ago.
1676.84 1679.00 SPEAKER_02  Save our neighborhood, no pedestrian mall.
1679.00 1681.32 SPEAKER_02  This is on an Airbnb.
1681.32 1682.52 SPEAKER_02  Shut up, you fucker.
1682.52 1683.32 SPEAKER_02  Oh, my God.
1683.32 1684.52 SPEAKER_01  Can I just...
1684.52 1692.76 SPEAKER_01  Explicitly, for everyone watching, listening, all of the evidence shows that business income increases when you pedestrianize an area.
1692.76 1698.20 SPEAKER_01  Just in case anyone was in any doubt about what the actual evidence is, these businesses are morons.
1698.20 1702.04 SPEAKER_01  Their patronage will increase when you pedestrianize the street.
1702.04 1703.88 SPEAKER_01  That is a fundamental thing.
1703.88 1714.44 SPEAKER_01  And also, to maintain access for disabled people coming through, it's very straightforward to enable, because those people who are driving, disabled people driving a vehicle, are...
1714.44 1718.36 SPEAKER_01  They are likely to be, firstly, very few vehicles allowed in.
1718.36 1723.00 SPEAKER_01  They can drive around at very low speeds, or you can have mobility scooters that allow them to move around.
1723.00 1725.48 SPEAKER_01  There are ways to manage that without limiting their access.
1725.48 1732.20 SPEAKER_01  But you can fully pedestrianize an area, and the business income will increase because the cars aren't in the way, because cars are a shit use of road space.
1732.20 1734.04 SPEAKER_01  I'm thinking, I'm developing a theory here.
1734.04 1735.64 SPEAKER_04  If you want more football, more space for feet.
1735.64 1741.88 SPEAKER_04  I'm developing a theory that not only a car is the highest American form of life, but drunk driving is the most sacred American activity.
1741.88 1742.52 SPEAKER_03  Yes.
1742.52 1743.40 SPEAKER_02  You're not wrong.
1743.40 1748.84 SPEAKER_02  I will say, some of the resistance here is also from people who just fucking hate tourists.
1749.48 1749.96 SPEAKER_02  Which...
1749.96 1750.92 SPEAKER_02  I understand.
1750.92 1752.20 SPEAKER_02  I definitely understand.
1752.20 1752.92 SPEAKER_02  I can't.
1752.92 1758.60 SPEAKER_04  I get that, but like, they lost that battle in New Orleans in like 1830.
1758.60 1759.00 SPEAKER_04  1830.
1759.00 1759.24 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1759.24 1760.12 SPEAKER_02  That's what I was about to say.
1760.12 1760.76 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, that shit has sailed.
1760.76 1760.84 SPEAKER_02  That's...
1760.84 1763.24 SPEAKER_02  You're not making any forward for us now.
1763.24 1767.96 SPEAKER_02  It's like living in fucking like Celebration, Florida, and being like this to me fucking tourist.
1767.96 1770.52 SPEAKER_02  Or like Venice, or like...
1770.52 1776.12 SPEAKER_03  I like the idea of a guy who does live in Celebration, Florida, and it's just like, if I see the mouse one more fucking time...
1776.12 1777.00 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1778.84 1782.84 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, a guy who lived there when it was all just orange groves, and is just like, I'm not...
1782.84 1783.72 SPEAKER_04  Why should I leave here?
1783.72 1784.92 SPEAKER_04  I was fucking here first.
1784.92 1785.40 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1785.40 1786.04 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1786.04 1787.24 SPEAKER_02  This was my small.
1787.24 1787.88 SPEAKER_02  This later proposal...
1787.88 1792.68 SPEAKER_02  This later proposal, the pedestrianized Bourbon Street was also, you know, sort of...
1792.68 1794.68 SPEAKER_02  Of course, ...disregarded.
1794.68 1795.48 SPEAKER_02  It was shot down.
1796.12 1797.16 SPEAKER_02  You know, this would have...
1797.88 1803.48 SPEAKER_02  You would have pedestrianized a few other streets in the French Quarter as well.
1803.48 1805.64 SPEAKER_02  You know, you'd have a bunch of traffic coming elsewhere.
1805.64 1809.32 SPEAKER_02  All the stuff that would have prevented you from driving a truck down there at 60 miles an hour.
1809.32 1810.04 SPEAKER_01  That made it nice.
1810.04 1811.32 SPEAKER_01  It would have made it nice.
1811.32 1811.96 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1811.96 1812.20 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1813.00 1816.28 SPEAKER_02  Admittedly, it's already very nice, but it would have made it nicer.
1816.28 1817.00 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1817.00 1817.40 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1817.40 1817.96 SPEAKER_03  New Orleans, my beloved.
1817.96 1818.52 SPEAKER_02  So anyway...
1818.52 1823.24 SPEAKER_03  The only city where I'm willing to move besides Philadelphia is New Orleans, Louisiana.
1823.24 1824.44 SPEAKER_03  So if anyone's got...
1824.44 1826.04 SPEAKER_03  So high on the list of like,
1826.04 1827.00 SPEAKER_01  needs to go there. Yeah.
1827.00 1827.32 SPEAKER_03  Beautiful place.
1827.32 1827.96 SPEAKER_03  Beautiful place.
1827.96 1830.28 SPEAKER_03  I love it.
1830.28 1834.12 SPEAKER_03  Every time I've been there, I've been treated like a king.
1834.12 1836.60 SPEAKER_03  I love it.
1836.60 1837.32 SPEAKER_03  I love New Orleans.
1837.32 1839.24 SPEAKER_03  And I genuinely, this one was like...
1839.88 1846.20 SPEAKER_03  This hit me especially because I was like, I, you know, as horrific and grotesque as Bourbon Street is, I just...
1846.20 1851.16 SPEAKER_03  A place that I dearly love and care about and just seeing this is gut-wrenching.
1851.16 1851.88 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1851.88 1852.28 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1852.28 1852.68 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1852.68 1854.28 SPEAKER_03  My sincere condolences.
1854.28 1855.56 SPEAKER_03  No, it's horrible.
1855.56 1856.44 SPEAKER_03  It is.
1856.44 1857.24 SPEAKER_03  And it's terrifying.
1857.24 1858.84 SPEAKER_03  And it like I...
1858.84 1864.84 SPEAKER_03  We had a shooting at the Christmas market here in Philly, and I had the thought after this happened of just, it wouldn't be that hard.
1864.84 1865.56 SPEAKER_03  And I just...
1865.56 1867.00 SPEAKER_02  That'd probably be pretty easy.
1867.00 1867.08 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1867.08 1870.68 SPEAKER_03  Just that, that fucking thought, man, is, is super grim.
1870.68 1873.00 SPEAKER_03  So, uh, let's talk about something even worse.
1873.00 1873.56 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1873.56 1873.80 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1873.80 1874.04 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1874.04 1889.00 SPEAKER_01  And like the car, car as a weapon again, like the car, like, I want to be explicit about the cars as an offensive weapon, not just causing climate change, not just like wrecking our space, space environment, but cars are getting heavier, getting, still getting more powerful.
1889.32 1890.44 SPEAKER_01  They are weapons.
1890.44 1890.92 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1890.92 1899.56 SPEAKER_04  It's just someone who is like apprehended the kind of like anti-social violent potential of a car more than like most other people have.
1899.56 1899.96 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1899.96 1903.00 SPEAKER_03  There's no reason for vehicles to be this big, this fast, and this heavy.
1903.00 1903.32 SPEAKER_03  No.
1903.32 1903.48 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1903.48 1904.44 SPEAKER_02  No, no.
1904.44 1904.84 SPEAKER_02  And I...
1904.84 1905.88 SPEAKER_02  This gets stupider.
1906.60 1906.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1906.92 1907.32 SPEAKER_03  All right.
1907.32 1908.84 SPEAKER_03  Let's talk about the truck bomb.
1908.84 1910.28 SPEAKER_03  Um, no, no, no, no.
1910.28 1911.00 SPEAKER_02  It gets stupider.
1911.00 1912.36 SPEAKER_02  Oh, fucking Jesus.
1912.36 1912.84 SPEAKER_02  All right.
1912.84 1916.44 SPEAKER_02  So anyway, these are pretty good hefty ballers they installed anyway, right?
1916.44 1917.88 SPEAKER_02  Um, you know, but...
1917.88 1919.72 SPEAKER_02  So how is the truck able to make it through?
1919.72 1923.72 SPEAKER_02  The answer is they were not compatible with the environment of Bourbon Street.
1923.72 1924.04 SPEAKER_04  What?
1924.04 1925.48 SPEAKER_04  What the fuck does that mean?
1925.48 1926.60 SPEAKER_04  It's not a graphics card.
1926.60 1927.72 SPEAKER_04  You just...
1927.72 1928.52 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1928.52 1931.56 SPEAKER_02  They had to be manually moved into place every evening.
1931.56 1945.56 SPEAKER_02  And because Bourbon Street is a place where people get very, very drunk, um, and drop stuff on the floor, the tracks got clogged up with beads and trash and, uh, what the municipal workers referred to as Bourbon Street juice.
1945.56 1947.72 SPEAKER_04  Oh, delicious.
1947.72 1954.12 SPEAKER_04  A heady mixture of zombie vomit, uh, and, like, God only knows what else.
1954.12 1954.60 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1954.60 1957.40 SPEAKER_01  I need to describe that as a serviceability limit state failure.
1957.40 1957.96 SPEAKER_01  Yes.
1957.96 1959.08 SPEAKER_01  That's poor design.
1959.08 1962.28 SPEAKER_01  Like, that's an obvious and inevitable outcome.
1962.28 1975.24 SPEAKER_02  In preparation for hosting the Super Bowl, they decided to clean up Bourbon Street and install new bollards and remove the old unreliable bollards, right?
1975.24 1975.72 SPEAKER_02  Which meant...
1975.72 1976.52 SPEAKER_02  Remove the matadors.
1977.24 1979.80 SPEAKER_02  The matadors were turned into doormats.
1979.80 1980.36 SPEAKER_02  Oh.
1980.36 1981.00 SPEAKER_02  Oh.
1981.00 1981.40 SPEAKER_02  Oh.
1981.40 1982.12 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1982.12 1982.52 SPEAKER_03  Sorry.
1982.52 1983.96 SPEAKER_03  I don't like it.
1983.96 1984.20 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1984.20 1991.80 SPEAKER_02  So, anyway, there were no bollards installed at the time of this impact.
1991.80 1999.72 SPEAKER_02  There was absolutely no kind of barrier whatsoever, save for the police SUV parked on Bourbon and Canal.
1999.72 2004.04 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, this is the one time where you need the cops to be double parked, and...
2004.04 2005.00 SPEAKER_04  Yes.
2005.00 2006.12 SPEAKER_02  And they lost them.
2006.12 2007.88 SPEAKER_04  They still managed to fuck that up, too.
2007.88 2008.28 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2008.28 2008.92 SPEAKER_04  So...
2008.92 2015.56 SPEAKER_02  So, anyway, yeah, from NOLA.com, the bollard project began in November, and was scheduled the last three months.
2015.56 2019.56 SPEAKER_02  It involves removing and replacing sections of road to take out the existing bollards.
2019.56 2027.88 SPEAKER_02  A city press release on Tuesday night noted the project was ongoing, but did not provide details of the work done such far.
2027.88 2029.96 SPEAKER_02  The old barriers never worked, blah, blah, blah.
2029.96 2031.00 SPEAKER_02  Bourbon Street juice.
2031.00 2032.04 SPEAKER_02  Um, yeah.
2032.04 2038.12 SPEAKER_02  The new bollards they want to put in only rated for a 5,000 pound impact at 10 miles an hour.
2038.12 2039.00 SPEAKER_01  Man, fuck off.
2039.00 2041.08 SPEAKER_01  So everything you were saying, NOLA, is correct.
2041.08 2042.92 SPEAKER_04  I was right, but about the wrong bollards.
2042.92 2045.32 SPEAKER_02  This is what I get for reading ahead in the notes.
2045.32 2047.56 SPEAKER_02  No, the new bollards aren't going to work.
2047.56 2049.80 SPEAKER_02  The old bollards would have worked fine, but they took them out.
2049.80 2050.76 SPEAKER_02  Uh-huh.
2050.76 2051.80 SPEAKER_02  Are you fucking kidding, man?
2051.80 2052.28 SPEAKER_01  So...
2052.28 2058.52 SPEAKER_01  No, you were just 100% correct about the bollards that put shit there now, hopeless.
2058.52 2069.64 SPEAKER_04  You know what you could do if you wanted to block a road in a way that you could get in and out of the way without having, uh, like, street juice blocking it as like some kind of a gate.
2069.64 2069.96 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2069.96 2070.36 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2070.36 2072.84 SPEAKER_04  It swings up or across, you know?
2072.84 2074.36 SPEAKER_02  So, usually on Canal Street...
2074.36 2076.52 SPEAKER_02  A big Bourbon Street, a castle, yes.
2076.52 2081.00 SPEAKER_02  At Bourbon and Canal, they have a, uh, what's called a wedge barrier.
2081.00 2083.64 SPEAKER_02  That's one of the ones where the big sheet metal flips up.
2083.64 2083.96 SPEAKER_02  Oh, yeah.
2083.96 2086.84 SPEAKER_02  The thing is, it's a portable one that's not there the whole day.
2086.84 2088.12 SPEAKER_02  The other thing is, it's, um...
2088.12 2088.92 SPEAKER_02  Oh, it fucking should be.
2088.92 2089.24 SPEAKER_04  What?
2089.24 2090.76 SPEAKER_02  It's, it's...
2090.76 2094.52 SPEAKER_04  Um, I'm just thinking about the juice coming off one of those wedges as it rises.
2094.52 2099.16 SPEAKER_02  Oh, I'm pouring down from the swamp, like, bird lock in it.
2099.16 2099.56 SPEAKER_02  Oh, yes!
2099.56 2106.36 SPEAKER_02  Bourbon actually has a pronounced grade towards the center because it is so frequently submerged in liquid.
2106.36 2107.36 SPEAKER_02  Oh.
2107.36 2116.72 SPEAKER_02  So, this portable wedge barrier, actually, like, half of it is, like, slightly in the air because it's flat, but the street is not.
2116.84 2117.84 SPEAKER_02  It's got a camera, yeah.
2117.84 2121.48 SPEAKER_02  So every time anything goes over it, it just bends the thing.
2121.48 2125.56 SPEAKER_02  Um, so I, I assume they just weren't using it because it was probably broken.
2125.56 2130.12 SPEAKER_04  Um, genuinely at this point, it's got to be cheaper to dig a moat.
2130.12 2131.64 SPEAKER_04  That's what I was saying.
2131.64 2132.64 SPEAKER_04  Yep.
2132.64 2133.64 SPEAKER_02  Dig the moat.
2133.64 2137.48 SPEAKER_02  But, but, they have, they have a levee that's like the reverse of a moat.
2137.48 2138.48 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2138.48 2139.48 SPEAKER_02  Um...
2139.48 2142.04 SPEAKER_02  Big earthen berm blocking off Canal Street.
2142.04 2143.04 SPEAKER_02  Oh my god.
2143.04 2144.28 SPEAKER_01  No cars, just make it no cars.
2144.28 2145.28 SPEAKER_01  Just to prevent...
2145.28 2152.80 SPEAKER_02  If you, if you, if you just, you know, you, you, if you just pedestrianized this thing, this would not have been possible if you just did it properly.
2152.80 2164.48 SPEAKER_02  Well, I mean, okay, you need some room for deliveries to some of these places, but, you know, if you had a lot of street furniture, if you had a lot of, you know, just, even like, chicanes would have made this impossible.
2165.04 2165.28 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2165.80 2166.08 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2166.08 2167.60 SPEAKER_04  But, you know...
2167.60 2176.96 SPEAKER_04  It just, uh, everything I know about New Orleans is that it's, it's a, uh, like a beautiful city that is tremendously poorly led and kind of always has been as long as it's existed.
2177.68 2183.02 SPEAKER_04  Um, and, yeah, you know, just kind of more, more of that, I guess.
2183.60 2192.28 SPEAKER_02  Well, you know, I, there's very little we can do to, uh, you know, no, no one wants to give up Americans' sacred right to drive a car as quick as possible everywhere.
2192.28 2196.82 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, no one competent ever wants to be mayor of anything, uh, is another part.
2196.92 2201.72 SPEAKER_04  Like, there's no, there's a real dearth of, like, effective municipal governance.
2201.82 2205.14 SPEAKER_04  That's why I did, sort of doing the fucking mayor podcast.
2205.46 2213.36 SPEAKER_04  Uh, it's, like, there's a real kind of, like, thing where it's just not something that anyone seems to bother to take seriously, even in large cities.
2213.64 2219.02 SPEAKER_02  We need, uh, we need, we need a, uh, you know, some kind of vat where we can grow new and it all goes.
2219.80 2220.02 SPEAKER_02  Um.
2221.18 2221.58 SPEAKER_02  Yes.
2221.74 2221.94 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2221.94 2223.86 SPEAKER_04  Doing the prestige to Annadale.
2224.34 2225.30 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, exactly.
2225.56 2232.68 SPEAKER_02  But also, there was a woman who was hit by the truck and then was shot, and she was told to come in to work the next day by Amazon.
2233.20 2235.24 SPEAKER_01  Yep, that just about sums those kind of tracks.
2235.24 2235.68 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2235.86 2236.06 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2236.66 2245.88 SPEAKER_02  So anyway, this very, very ugly truck attack here that could have been solved with, uh, a little bit better municipal governance if, if, if that.
2246.00 2256.30 SPEAKER_02  I mean, you know, these, these are ways you can be resilient to sort of the horrible alienation that's resulting in these bizarre terrorist attacks.
2256.30 2256.50 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2256.50 2258.90 SPEAKER_04  That's, that's the thing that I always come back to, right?
2258.94 2260.02 SPEAKER_04  Is that, like, yeah.
2260.16 2260.30 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2260.30 2265.88 SPEAKER_04  It's, it's, it's, it's a, it's a, like a symptom of a, uh, like really, like, of an age of incoherence, right?
2266.04 2266.16 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2266.16 2267.50 SPEAKER_01  Do you know how you make yourself less lonely?
2267.50 2278.58 SPEAKER_01  Is you take the person out of the three and a half ton isolation box and you make them mix with other pedestrians in a largely pedestrianized part of a beautiful city.
2278.58 2283.32 SPEAKER_04  I mean, you can't even make Americans ride the subway with each other without having them kill each other now.
2283.60 2283.62 SPEAKER_04  So.
2283.96 2284.14 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2284.14 2284.76 SPEAKER_02  This is true.
2284.90 2288.26 SPEAKER_02  This is, well, we'll get to that later in the presentation.
2288.84 2289.44 SPEAKER_02  Oh God.
2289.58 2289.98 SPEAKER_02  Okay.
2290.58 2294.24 SPEAKER_01  Uh, can we talk about a fun car based violence?
2294.54 2294.74 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2294.78 2296.80 SPEAKER_02  Let's talk about the stupider one.
2297.46 2297.82 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2298.32 2298.74 SPEAKER_01  Okay.
2298.78 2299.02 SPEAKER_01  Right.
2299.08 2305.62 SPEAKER_01  So we have to, we have to tackle the, firstly, we, I laid this into existence in the last episode.
2305.78 2305.96 SPEAKER_01  We did.
2306.24 2306.54 SPEAKER_04  You did.
2306.54 2308.58 SPEAKER_04  Uh, sorry, everyone.
2308.78 2310.02 SPEAKER_01  We need the mental bookend here.
2311.46 2312.14 SPEAKER_01  All right, go.
2312.26 2312.56 SPEAKER_01  Oh yes.
2312.64 2312.88 SPEAKER_01  Sorry.
2313.24 2313.50 SPEAKER_01  Yes.
2313.60 2325.90 SPEAKER_01  We laid this into existence, uh, as a podcast and I can only apologize for suggesting that it would be a cyber trunk, a cyber trunk bombing Trump, uh, as we could see here happening.
2325.90 2326.24 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2326.66 2328.82 SPEAKER_02  That did in fact happen.
2329.34 2331.04 SPEAKER_02  A man, a man.
2331.50 2334.88 SPEAKER_04  Not just any man, but one of God's own green berets.
2334.88 2345.70 SPEAKER_04  He's a special forces soldier, which makes everything that follows significantly funnier when you consider the whole, like, these guys are like hyper trained killers kind of thing.
2346.12 2346.54 SPEAKER_04  A man.
2346.86 2348.06 SPEAKER_01  It was the most pathetic explosion.
2348.18 2348.62 SPEAKER_01  Oh, sorry.
2348.74 2349.22 SPEAKER_02  Anyway, go on.
2349.22 2349.46 SPEAKER_02  Go on.
2349.52 2349.62 SPEAKER_02  Go on, Russ.
2349.62 2351.62 SPEAKER_02  He went to the cyber truck off of Turo.
2351.62 2352.32 SPEAKER_02  Off of Turo.
2352.78 2352.96 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2352.96 2359.30 SPEAKER_02  Then asked chat GPT how to get to Las Vegas and drove for the wrong one.
2359.30 2364.56 SPEAKER_04  He also asked chat GPT.
2364.74 2367.68 SPEAKER_04  And again, this guy was, this guy was, he was a green beret.
2367.82 2368.66 SPEAKER_04  He was in the special forces.
2369.08 2369.24 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
2369.38 2369.50 SPEAKER_00  Okay.
2369.50 2374.86 SPEAKER_04  He asked chat GPT how to build a bomb, what explosives he might need.
2374.86 2386.36 SPEAKER_04  And for the first time in ever, AI's tendency to just hallucinate wrong shit saved lives.
2386.98 2387.32 SPEAKER_01  Yes.
2387.62 2398.10 SPEAKER_01  So the most dangerous thing, the most dangerous object that we see here of all the stuff that was dumped into it and around it was the cyber truck itself.
2398.40 2403.14 SPEAKER_01  Because, right, he filled the incredibly small boot of this thing with fireworks.
2403.14 2406.06 SPEAKER_01  Now, fireworks don't explode hot.
2406.28 2408.34 SPEAKER_01  They also don't explode particularly violently.
2408.82 2414.84 SPEAKER_04  He had seen the most recent bonus episode and was like, what if, what if I did that?
2414.92 2416.42 SPEAKER_04  But in a way that was also a.
2417.12 2420.06 SPEAKER_04  Also, you're going to have to bleep the word side and all of this.
2420.18 2420.50 SPEAKER_04  Sorry, Devin.
2420.60 2421.56 SPEAKER_04  Oh, sorry, Devin.
2421.62 2422.64 SPEAKER_04  We'll try not to use it too much.
2422.76 2423.60 SPEAKER_01  There was one in the last one as well.
2424.96 2437.08 SPEAKER_01  So he, yeah, he went to EntFX and he hired the O bang and he put that in the boot and of the cyber truck, drove it according to the wrong, to the wrong place.
2437.32 2439.78 SPEAKER_02  To the wrong Las Vegas, Las Vegas, New Mexico.
2440.30 2440.60 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2440.78 2444.22 SPEAKER_02  Realized his mistake and drove to the regular Las Vegas.
2446.48 2448.70 SPEAKER_02  Those marvelous green brights.
2448.84 2449.28 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2449.54 2455.18 SPEAKER_01  I love how much AI is just going to be a confounding factor in like increasing amounts of news.
2455.18 2470.04 SPEAKER_01  We're like, oh yeah, this is this terrorist attack happened, but it happened in a, it happened where no one was in like a set for a movie film of us, of the city rather than the actual city because AI just sent someone that way.
2470.10 2470.92 SPEAKER_01  I just, yeah.
2470.94 2471.20 SPEAKER_01  Okay.
2471.26 2473.60 SPEAKER_01  Doing nine 11 to Manhattan, Kansas.
2476.44 2477.36 SPEAKER_01  Oh man.
2477.42 2478.78 SPEAKER_01  Just, just incredible work.
2478.82 2479.06 SPEAKER_01  Anyway.
2479.06 2480.26 SPEAKER_01  So it went pop.
2480.34 2482.22 SPEAKER_01  Did it, it didn't even break any windows, right?
2482.22 2492.08 SPEAKER_04  It was just, I think it injured like a couple of people who were nearby, but like, I shot himself and then hit the fucking, uh, God.
2492.16 2492.36 SPEAKER_01  Okay.
2492.36 2493.74 SPEAKER_04  The detonation thing.
2493.74 2498.74 SPEAKER_04  And then just kind of, you had a very like voluminous fireworks, the explosion.
2499.46 2501.66 SPEAKER_04  Um, and the cyber truck caught on fire.
2501.68 2502.64 SPEAKER_01  It was pretty loony tunes.
2503.22 2503.48 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2503.48 2504.80 SPEAKER_01  It was a bit comedic.
2504.88 2505.08 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2505.46 2509.96 SPEAKER_01  Um, and then of course one, when, when the cyber truck got hot enough, that was then things started getting dangerous.
2510.08 2510.30 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2510.30 2515.88 SPEAKER_04  I mean, yeah, you're then faced with a cyber truck fire, which is not great.
2516.26 2516.54 SPEAKER_04  Um, no.
2516.72 2518.12 SPEAKER_04  I said this on-
2518.12 2522.78 SPEAKER_02  Elon was like, uh, um, look how great the cyber truck performed. Because it was designed for this, yeah.
2522.98 2526.38 SPEAKER_02  It was designed for this, because my cyber truck is made of steel.
2526.94 2528.54 SPEAKER_02  Guess what other cars are made of?
2528.70 2529.40 SPEAKER_02  Sometimes aluminum.
2530.24 2531.80 SPEAKER_01  Sometimes cars are a fucking dweeb.
2532.16 2532.24 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2532.70 2533.18 SPEAKER_01  Twat.
2533.92 2534.18 SPEAKER_01  Anyway.
2534.40 2535.30 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, there it is.
2535.72 2536.34 SPEAKER_01  It's just-
2536.34 2543.14 SPEAKER_04  I mean, that means we're sliding towards a future where the Los Angeles County fire department is unable to push a cyber truck out of the way.
2543.64 2544.50 SPEAKER_01  Oh my god.
2545.86 2546.96 SPEAKER_01  No, they'll upgrade.
2547.08 2547.48 SPEAKER_01  It's fine.
2548.24 2550.14 SPEAKER_01  They're- They're- Fire with fire.
2550.32 2551.30 SPEAKER_01  Just in case.
2552.00 2553.02 SPEAKER_01  Surplus IDF.
2553.02 2553.52 SPEAKER_01  Please.
2554.06 2555.28 SPEAKER_04  Bigger bulldozers.
2555.68 2555.88 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2555.96 2556.20 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2556.30 2557.82 SPEAKER_02  Buy them from the IDF.
2558.82 2561.02 SPEAKER_04  No, I want them to stay BDS compliant.
2561.58 2562.76 SPEAKER_02  That's a good point, yeah.
2562.96 2563.14 SPEAKER_02  True.
2563.14 2565.32 SPEAKER_02  It's a BDS compliant bulldozer.
2565.68 2575.92 SPEAKER_04  The bulldozer is a really, the bulldozer is a really, like, kind of an extremes of morality technology in the sense of, like, you can use it for a genocide, or you can use it to crush a cyber truck to, like, do firefighting.
2575.92 2578.06 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, that really is the opposite end of the spectrum.
2579.12 2582.36 SPEAKER_02  Is Caterpillar on the BDS list?
2582.36 2582.74 SPEAKER_02  Oh, big time.
2582.94 2583.34 SPEAKER_02  Oh god, yeah.
2583.34 2584.84 SPEAKER_04  Okay, that's what I figured, yeah.
2584.84 2590.66 SPEAKER_04  I mean, I guess you'd have to, I mean, where else, who else builds bulldozers, you know?
2590.86 2591.22 SPEAKER_01  China.
2591.38 2594.22 SPEAKER_04  There are, like, 20 different bulldozer manufacturers in China.
2594.54 2596.86 SPEAKER_04  Human rights abuses, then.
2597.72 2598.62 SPEAKER_04  Probably Volvo.
2599.48 2599.76 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2600.12 2601.84 SPEAKER_02  I think Volvo might be woke, I don't know.
2602.12 2603.42 SPEAKER_02  Volvo woke manufacturers.
2604.00 2606.52 SPEAKER_02  The logo, the logo is the man symbol.
2606.88 2607.10 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2607.26 2607.70 SPEAKER_04  So, no.
2608.40 2610.58 SPEAKER_04  Well, they care about men's mental health, is the thing.
2610.58 2617.10 SPEAKER_02  We gotta get, we gotta get Volvo to change it to the trans symbol, and then they'll be woke.
2617.88 2619.22 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, that's it.
2619.74 2621.76 SPEAKER_04  I'm gonna need Volvo to do a couple of things.
2621.86 2624.32 SPEAKER_04  First of all, change the logo to the trans symbol.
2624.50 2626.46 SPEAKER_04  Second of all, build the world's largest bulldozer.
2626.84 2629.58 SPEAKER_04  Three, start giving it to American firefighters.
2630.22 2630.96 SPEAKER_02  Yes, exactly.
2630.96 2631.46 SPEAKER_02  That seems fair.
2631.52 2633.58 SPEAKER_02  Okay, glad we're making progress today.
2634.16 2636.58 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, it's, you know, we're rattling through this agenda.
2636.58 2639.42 SPEAKER_04  We have a coherent vision for a better world.
2639.42 2639.64 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2639.64 2640.04 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
2640.66 2641.14 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2641.44 2648.96 SPEAKER_04  Imagine, imagine, uh, the, like, woke fire department, uh, bulldozer crushing a cyber truck forever.
2649.30 2650.58 SPEAKER_04  And that's our vision of the future.
2651.50 2652.46 SPEAKER_01  Komatsu, Europe.
2652.58 2653.14 SPEAKER_01  That's who we want.
2653.46 2654.68 SPEAKER_01  That's who's building our bulldozers.
2654.82 2655.26 SPEAKER_01  Komatsu.
2656.10 2657.18 SPEAKER_01  That's who we're going for.
2657.28 2657.60 SPEAKER_01  Sure, yeah.
2657.94 2658.94 SPEAKER_01  I'll send him the invoice.
2658.98 2664.36 SPEAKER_04  Do you think bulldozer guys get, like, really, like, tribal about their bulldozer affiliation, like, like, power tools guys do?
2664.36 2665.44 SPEAKER_04  Oh, 100%.
2665.44 2665.72 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
2666.20 2666.50 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2666.50 2672.64 SPEAKER_04  It's like they're making up, like, homophobic acronyms for, like, other, like, bulldozer manufacturers.
2672.64 2679.16 SPEAKER_02  Like, the operating engineers union is, like, barely holding together constantly because of these internal divisions.
2679.16 2679.96 SPEAKER_04  Internal power struggles.
2679.96 2685.38 SPEAKER_04  It's like, yeah, I showed him my set of keys to the Komatsu and he stabbed me in the hand with a pencil.
2685.38 2685.58 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2685.66 2686.10 SPEAKER_04  I don't...
2686.10 2690.60 SPEAKER_04  Oh, dear.
2691.56 2692.38 SPEAKER_04  Anyway, boom.
2692.90 2693.50 SPEAKER_04  Cargo boom.
2693.68 2698.34 SPEAKER_04  This is, again, another symptom of incoherence, this time of much less consequence.
2698.74 2701.38 SPEAKER_04  I've been calling this whole thing the years of lead poisoning.
2701.60 2702.60 SPEAKER_04  I'm really happy with that.
2702.68 2703.72 SPEAKER_02  I'm going to be using it on everything.
2703.72 2704.80 SPEAKER_02  I was about to say.
2704.88 2709.54 SPEAKER_02  The other thing is, of course, this guy who did this, whatever the hell this was, was a big Trump guy.
2709.86 2710.14 SPEAKER_02  Yes.
2710.58 2714.58 SPEAKER_04  Donald Trump supporters love trying to assassinate him when they're bored.
2715.08 2715.48 SPEAKER_04  Like...
2715.48 2717.18 SPEAKER_00  It's true.
2717.68 2718.08 SPEAKER_00  It's true.
2718.08 2718.36 SPEAKER_04  It's true.
2718.36 2728.64 SPEAKER_04  His enemies have way more reason to assassinate him, and yet, as far as we can tell, like, basically none of them have made a serious run of it, but his own guys, they love trying to kill him.
2728.72 2729.82 SPEAKER_04  They can't get enough of it.
2729.82 2731.38 SPEAKER_04  It's like...
2731.38 2732.00 SPEAKER_04  Oh, dear.
2732.28 2740.74 SPEAKER_04  You ever that editorial cartoon, it was like Washington Post, whatever, with the, like, like, dark MAGA figure with the, like, I'll take care of the Mr. President.
2740.98 2743.24 SPEAKER_04  It's like that, but he's shooting at Trump.
2743.68 2745.16 SPEAKER_04  He's got a gunpoint directly.
2745.32 2745.94 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
2745.94 2748.82 SPEAKER_04  Yes, sir, Mr. President, I'll take care of the woke deep state.
2750.82 2751.86 SPEAKER_04  Sighting up Trump.
2752.62 2755.36 SPEAKER_02  This man has created a reverse secret service.
2755.36 2762.04 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, he's created a core of, like, thousands of lunatics dedicated to his own assassination.
2762.62 2763.42 SPEAKER_04  What if this is...
2763.42 2763.80 SPEAKER_04  What if...
2763.80 2765.44 SPEAKER_04  I'm gonna try and get it into every item.
2765.54 2766.52 SPEAKER_04  What if this is an elaborate...
2766.52 2766.98 SPEAKER_04  YouTube.
2767.10 2767.58 SPEAKER_04  ...method?
2767.88 2769.06 SPEAKER_04  What if Trump is like...
2769.06 2770.80 SPEAKER_04  He's still like...
2770.80 2772.64 SPEAKER_04  I don't want to be president.
2772.82 2773.66 SPEAKER_04  I want to die.
2774.24 2777.72 SPEAKER_04  And so he's just, like, setting up these guys, you know?
2777.78 2778.76 SPEAKER_02  Oh, you've heard of...
2778.76 2779.06 SPEAKER_02  No.
2779.28 2779.88 SPEAKER_02  By cop.
2779.98 2780.36 SPEAKER_02  This is...
2780.36 2781.38 SPEAKER_02  Can't say that on YouTube.
2781.60 2782.78 SPEAKER_02  By political supporters.
2782.78 2783.22 SPEAKER_02  YouTube.
2784.54 2784.86 SPEAKER_02  YouTube.
2785.16 2786.22 SPEAKER_04  By assassin.
2786.72 2786.94 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2787.12 2787.46 SPEAKER_02  Yes.
2787.54 2790.44 SPEAKER_04  There's gonna be a little counter for that word in the corner that Devin's gonna maintain.
2790.60 2791.38 SPEAKER_01  Devin, I'm so sorry.
2791.68 2792.90 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, I'd like you to...
2792.90 2802.66 SPEAKER_04  If you can do the counter, that'd be great, but ideally what I'd like you to do is instead of a beep, just replace every instance of the word with a really flat recording of yourself saying YouTube.
2803.40 2803.92 SPEAKER_04  That'd be great.
2803.92 2804.48 SPEAKER_02  Thank you.
2804.80 2810.70 SPEAKER_02  My understanding is that, um, actually YouTube doesn't censor you saying...
2810.70 2811.46 SPEAKER_02  Gotta take that out.
2811.46 2817.32 SPEAKER_02  This is a form of mass psychosis that Gen Z has imposed on us.
2817.32 2818.04 SPEAKER_04  Oh, on a live.
2818.04 2818.88 SPEAKER_03  Oh, that's a good one.
2818.88 2819.96 SPEAKER_04  Like on a living yourself.
2819.96 2820.96 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, possibly.
2820.96 2821.46 SPEAKER_02  Exactly.
2821.46 2821.96 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2821.96 2825.38 SPEAKER_04  We did get a video get, like, de-boosted or whatever the fuck it is.
2825.38 2825.88 SPEAKER_04  From...
2825.88 2829.38 SPEAKER_02  No, that was because we talked about Aaron Bushnell.
2830.00 2834.30 SPEAKER_02  I think that was a specific political thing that YouTube did not like.
2834.30 2837.52 SPEAKER_02  I guess we can A-B test that with this, you know?
2837.52 2837.68 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2837.68 2838.26 SPEAKER_01  I'm sure we're going to try.
2838.46 2838.64 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2838.72 2839.54 SPEAKER_01  I quoted.
2839.68 2844.12 SPEAKER_01  I read a quote by him in my New Year's Natter, actually.
2844.26 2851.46 SPEAKER_01  I had one very angry email about it because he gave a really good quote on Reddit in 2023 that I thought was pretty inspirational.
2851.46 2854.66 SPEAKER_01  And, yeah, YouTube hasn't hit me hard on that.
2854.74 2855.74 SPEAKER_01  But, yeah, I don't know.
2855.84 2856.68 SPEAKER_01  I've noticed anyway.
2856.90 2857.02 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2857.12 2860.28 SPEAKER_04  Zoom's still being proven more right every day.
2860.38 2861.32 SPEAKER_04  I think a lot about the...
2861.32 2864.62 SPEAKER_04  This is what our ruling class has decided is going to be normal.
2865.26 2865.46 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2865.46 2866.86 SPEAKER_04  I think that's...
2866.86 2867.04 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2867.14 2869.84 SPEAKER_04  We're looking at all of this and, yeah, getting that feeling.
2870.04 2870.16 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2870.32 2870.74 SPEAKER_04  Well done.
2870.80 2872.46 SPEAKER_04  That slides later in the presentation.
2872.46 2873.18 SPEAKER_04  Oh, my God.
2873.18 2874.20 SPEAKER_01  Oh, my God.
2875.10 2880.78 SPEAKER_01  The word incoherence, political incoherence comes up a lot.
2880.94 2881.60 SPEAKER_01  That just...
2881.60 2883.08 SPEAKER_01  I think, in fact, I think Hussein...
2883.08 2887.90 SPEAKER_01  Not to cross-post, but, like, yeah, the last trash feature with Hussein, Hussein kept talking about it.
2888.18 2893.70 SPEAKER_01  And I think he was spot on with that point about this incoherence is just going to happen more and more because the landscape is incoherent.
2893.96 2895.66 SPEAKER_01  Like, the politicians are incoherent.
2895.96 2896.48 SPEAKER_01  Anyway, sorry.
2896.60 2897.02 SPEAKER_01  Next slide.
2897.14 2901.02 SPEAKER_01  Let's talk about some other really horrific things going on.
2901.80 2902.16 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2902.46 2907.56 SPEAKER_02  We've lost another 737.
2908.30 2909.64 SPEAKER_03  Oh, our T-shirt's still in.
2909.64 2909.92 SPEAKER_02  It's a Max.
2910.66 2910.88 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2911.00 2911.20 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2911.24 2912.18 SPEAKER_01  This is not a Max.
2912.26 2913.14 SPEAKER_01  This was an 800.
2913.46 2914.80 SPEAKER_01  Isn't the 800 just the...
2914.80 2916.68 SPEAKER_01  Haven't they just rebranded the Max?
2916.98 2917.44 SPEAKER_01  No, no.
2917.52 2919.98 SPEAKER_02  This is a much older airplane, actually.
2920.16 2921.66 SPEAKER_02  Oh, forgive me.
2921.72 2921.94 SPEAKER_02  Okay.
2922.22 2924.88 SPEAKER_02  I believe this is before even the 737 NG.
2926.20 2926.92 SPEAKER_02  Oh, okay.
2927.02 2927.40 SPEAKER_02  Crikey.
2927.90 2931.24 SPEAKER_02  Jeju Air Flight 7C-2216.
2931.24 2939.12 SPEAKER_02  left Bangkok, Thailand, approached for its scheduled landing at Muan International Airport in southern South Korea.
2939.72 2942.06 SPEAKER_02  They had an initial failed landing attempt.
2942.18 2943.08 SPEAKER_02  There was a go-around.
2943.08 2948.66 SPEAKER_02  And they had a bird strike, I believe, at least when I wrote this slide.
2948.76 2949.96 SPEAKER_02  That was the most current information.
2949.96 2950.96 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2950.96 2953.02 SPEAKER_02  So they went...
2953.02 2954.04 SPEAKER_02  They did a go-around.
2954.26 2955.78 SPEAKER_02  They came back in for landing.
2956.14 2959.70 SPEAKER_02  The flight crew sent a distress signal.
2960.20 2966.96 SPEAKER_02  They tried to land on a different runway than the one they were, you know, given clearance for, because apparently that's all they could do.
2967.48 2971.86 SPEAKER_02  The plane touched down without lowering its landing gear, right?
2971.92 2974.48 SPEAKER_02  It skidded along the runway, very high speed.
2974.86 2977.56 SPEAKER_02  Actually, for a belly landing, absolutely beautiful.
2978.06 2979.42 SPEAKER_02  Pilots did a great job.
2979.58 2981.42 SPEAKER_02  Thing is, they couldn't stop in time.
2981.78 2983.42 SPEAKER_02  Overshot the end of the runway.
2983.42 2994.34 SPEAKER_02  And so at the end of the runway is the localizer antenna, which is usually made of a sort of material that can break away in these sorts of instances.
2994.66 2999.80 SPEAKER_04  Well, what they did was they perfectly prevented a truck attack from hitting the end of the runway.
3000.52 3001.04 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3001.26 3001.48 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3001.68 3002.12 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3002.64 3007.48 SPEAKER_02  This localizer was on a big concrete berm and the plane hit it.
3008.02 3009.34 SPEAKER_02  And just blew up.
3009.34 3012.20 SPEAKER_02  Everyone except two flight attendants at the back of the plane died.
3012.32 3012.48 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3012.98 3013.42 SPEAKER_01  Christ.
3014.06 3014.38 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3014.60 3023.74 SPEAKER_01  It sounded, again, this is one where if there is, we need to wait until there's a report on this because all the details on this seem a little bit muddy still.
3023.92 3029.84 SPEAKER_01  I'm now a pro-air crash investigator, having watched pretty much every single episode of air crash investigation because I'm obsessed.
3029.84 3029.86 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, exactly.
3030.26 3033.32 SPEAKER_02  I've watched a lot of mentor pilots, so I'm an expert.
3033.98 3040.10 SPEAKER_04  Each episode of appearance on this podcast is equivalent to a year's, like, like college.
3040.32 3042.02 SPEAKER_03  You all have your pilot's licenses now.
3042.14 3042.44 SPEAKER_03  Congratulations.
3042.96 3043.70 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, exactly.
3044.30 3045.38 SPEAKER_01  The credits come good.
3045.60 3054.72 SPEAKER_01  So it seemed like there's suggestions that they, that the pilots landed it beautifully, but they took too, that they, they just took too long along the runway.
3054.84 3056.92 SPEAKER_01  They went too far down the runway without touching down.
3056.92 3061.88 SPEAKER_01  So they didn't have enough to spend enough time skidding along on their belly to slow it down.
3062.06 3064.16 SPEAKER_01  That seems like, yeah.
3064.16 3064.24 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3065.58 3065.98 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3066.12 3068.68 SPEAKER_01  I'll be, I'll be very interested to see how, what, what went down on this one.
3068.68 3070.38 SPEAKER_01  Cause it's a, it's a real fucking mess.
3070.60 3071.78 SPEAKER_04  It's really hard to say.
3071.86 3080.90 SPEAKER_04  And like, also, I don't know if you put this in the slides, but like South Korea, a country that is experiencing a surfeit of news at the moment, like a real news.
3080.90 3081.66 SPEAKER_02  Oh, right.
3081.74 3081.98 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3082.16 3083.40 SPEAKER_04  I should have put that one in.
3083.50 3083.64 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3084.42 3085.42 SPEAKER_01  I came away.
3085.64 3086.14 SPEAKER_01  It's fine.
3086.24 3088.02 SPEAKER_01  Like it, it closed itself off neatly.
3088.02 3088.32 SPEAKER_01  Right.
3088.38 3088.74 SPEAKER_01  That's it.
3088.74 3089.32 SPEAKER_01  It's all good.
3089.32 3091.84 SPEAKER_04  And everything's fine and dandy in South Korea right now.
3091.96 3093.10 SPEAKER_04  Not, not so much.
3093.18 3093.42 SPEAKER_04  No.
3093.60 3097.10 SPEAKER_04  Uh, I think they're up at like two presidents impeached sequentially.
3097.62 3102.00 SPEAKER_04  And like one of them is like barricading himself in his house with the secret service.
3102.02 3106.78 SPEAKER_04  Like, uh, as the, you know, the cops try to arrest him, the non secret service cops.
3106.96 3109.18 SPEAKER_02  God, I hope, I hope we can have that kind of politics.
3109.18 3110.08 SPEAKER_03  I love the idea.
3110.18 3111.56 SPEAKER_03  Just, I'm never coming out.
3111.58 3112.06 SPEAKER_03  Just like that.
3112.14 3112.26 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3112.26 3113.40 SPEAKER_03  Bashing at the door of the plunger.
3113.40 3113.58 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3113.62 3113.76 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3113.98 3114.52 SPEAKER_01  Oh man.
3114.52 3122.34 SPEAKER_01  So hypercapitalist, the, the, the, the countries in the, in East Asia, in the far East where we exported hypercapitalism, uh, it's doing great.
3122.42 3129.10 SPEAKER_01  So South Korea, uh, it seems like their entire democracy is collapsed in on itself and Japan, the average age is 78.
3129.50 3132.44 SPEAKER_01  So, um, yeah, it's going real, going real good out there.
3132.64 3133.38 SPEAKER_01  Um, yeah.
3133.64 3134.04 SPEAKER_01  Terrific.
3135.00 3135.16 SPEAKER_04  Oof.
3135.56 3148.72 SPEAKER_04  And, and so also now this in a country with like, a kind of like barely functioning executive, uh, is, is sort of like, yeah, it's never a good time to have a massive plane crash, but this is no distinctly a great one.
3149.04 3149.30 SPEAKER_01  Worst time.
3149.64 3149.74 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3149.82 3150.74 SPEAKER_02  Not a great time.
3150.82 3151.00 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3151.10 3154.30 SPEAKER_01  I mean, South Korea and some people are going to catch me if I'm wrong on this one.
3154.34 3155.92 SPEAKER_01  South Korea has a pretty good safety record.
3156.08 3157.48 SPEAKER_01  Oh, like world standard.
3157.68 3157.94 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3157.96 3158.14 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3158.14 3158.34 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3158.34 3162.06 SPEAKER_01  As in like, in terms of like actual crap, very low, you know, we're not talking Taiwan.
3162.20 3166.96 SPEAKER_01  We're not, this isn't China airlines, you know, where they have like six, seven, four, sevens hit the dirt a year.
3166.96 3171.74 SPEAKER_01  This is like, um, this is, this is a very high, um, very good safety rate.
3171.94 3175.92 SPEAKER_01  I would hope then that they have a very effective crash investigation board.
3175.92 3180.20 SPEAKER_01  And obviously, you know, the NTSB will be over there sniffing around as well and support them.
3180.30 3182.42 SPEAKER_01  So yeah, I look forward to reading the crash report into this one.
3182.92 3185.64 SPEAKER_02  This is all going to be very heavily, uh, investigated.
3185.80 3189.78 SPEAKER_02  I was interested to see that there was no, apparently no, uh, what's it?
3189.96 3193.86 SPEAKER_02  E-mass at, on this runway, the engineered material arresting system.
3193.86 3205.68 SPEAKER_02  Um, it just seems like this airport was old and poorly designed and couldn't handle the runway, uh, overrun without, um, you know, the aircraft turning into, you know, razor blades.
3205.86 3206.02 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3206.30 3206.64 SPEAKER_04  Mm.
3206.94 3207.42 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3207.80 3211.66 SPEAKER_01  This is, this is a, I mean, you don't get many big crashes like this anymore.
3211.66 3212.14 SPEAKER_01  Thankfully.
3212.44 3217.22 SPEAKER_04  You also don't get many that are like apparently caused by like airport design.
3217.22 3220.22 SPEAKER_04  That's something that you tend to think has been pretty standardized.
3220.22 3230.34 SPEAKER_01  Do you know, we had quite a few in the nineties and then kind of since then none really, because we fixed, you know, E-max is a good example of a, of a thing that, you know, we, we kind of, it was a solved problem.
3230.42 3235.28 SPEAKER_01  We had, you know, the surgeon down drafts in the early nineties as well, the various things that we kind of solved.
3235.48 3237.54 SPEAKER_01  And, um, so it is surprising to see this.
3237.92 3238.14 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3238.22 3240.94 SPEAKER_01  I just, it's one of those situations I look forward to seeing the crash report.
3241.08 3243.30 SPEAKER_01  Uh, it'll be really interesting reading to see what's going on.
3243.30 3250.06 SPEAKER_01  Cause it feels like it feels like there's not been good crew resource management like this for this to happen.
3250.14 3252.06 SPEAKER_01  It's likely there was stuff going on in the cockpit.
3252.94 3253.30 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3253.38 3257.78 SPEAKER_01  You know, bird strikes to bring an aircraft down is unusual, very unusual.
3257.78 3257.98 SPEAKER_01  Right.
3258.12 3259.68 SPEAKER_01  Like they're designed to deal with this shit.
3259.88 3260.12 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3260.22 3262.28 SPEAKER_01  There's, there's a lot of stuff that doesn't add up.
3262.30 3263.16 SPEAKER_01  And I think you're right.
3263.18 3267.42 SPEAKER_01  It's going to be one of those situations where, you know, where air traffic control overworked mismatch.
3267.50 3267.64 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3267.72 3269.34 SPEAKER_01  We, we, I look forward to reading that crash report.
3269.34 3271.82 SPEAKER_04  Really, really intense bird strike.
3271.82 3274.14 SPEAKER_04  Like the bird, it's more of a bird hijacking.
3274.40 3275.90 SPEAKER_02  Like you've got a goose trying to get in the cockpit.
3275.90 3276.38 SPEAKER_02  Albatrossy.
3276.70 3277.78 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, exactly.
3277.92 3278.32 SPEAKER_02  Exactly.
3278.42 3279.28 SPEAKER_02  It's a bird strike.
3279.36 3280.94 SPEAKER_02  It turned out it was Feathers McGraw.
3281.38 3281.76 SPEAKER_02  Oh, no.
3282.00 3282.64 SPEAKER_00  This is great.
3282.96 3283.94 SPEAKER_02  That wily fuck.
3284.30 3284.52 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3285.08 3285.40 SPEAKER_02  Uh.
3285.66 3285.84 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3286.22 3286.44 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3286.76 3289.24 SPEAKER_02  So, um, who knows what happened here.
3289.80 3292.90 SPEAKER_02  Um, anyway, in other news.
3295.00 3296.42 SPEAKER_02  How we did it in Gaza?
3296.78 3297.44 SPEAKER_02  Uh, poorly.
3297.90 3298.10 SPEAKER_04  Bad.
3298.50 3300.30 SPEAKER_04  Real, real bad.
3300.70 3301.02 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3301.10 3301.32 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3301.32 3303.46 SPEAKER_02  I was about to say, it's getting real, real ugly.
3303.60 3305.08 SPEAKER_02  And no end in sight here.
3305.76 3313.98 SPEAKER_02  Um, Israel has blown up or set fire to Kamal Adwin Hospital, which was the last functioning hospital in the north of Gaza.
3314.14 3315.12 SPEAKER_03  Pure fucking evil.
3315.48 3316.36 SPEAKER_03  Same as it ever was.
3316.56 3324.74 SPEAKER_02  I believe there's been some kind of torture video released where the Israelis got some doctor to admit there was Hamas in the, uh, hospital.
3324.74 3327.62 SPEAKER_02  NYT breathlessly reported on that.
3327.62 3332.40 SPEAKER_02  Um, I'm pretty sure that was, you know, complete fucking nonsense.
3332.40 3332.72 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3333.02 3333.48 SPEAKER_02  Exactly.
3333.54 3342.00 SPEAKER_04  You know, I'll, I'll, I'll say this much since it's clear that the Israelis would have like, uh, like destroyed the hospital either way.
3342.00 3343.46 SPEAKER_04  At that point, it doesn't matter.
3343.46 3344.12 SPEAKER_04  You know?
3344.18 3345.22 SPEAKER_04  It doesn't really matter.
3345.44 3345.54 SPEAKER_02  Exactly.
3346.04 3346.24 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3346.60 3348.76 SPEAKER_04  It's, yeah, it's a war crime, but like.
3349.48 3350.40 SPEAKER_02  Not like they give a shit.
3350.48 3351.74 SPEAKER_04  The whole thing's been a war crime.
3351.86 3352.02 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3352.50 3353.48 SPEAKER_01  Why are we like a year and a half?
3353.48 3354.52 SPEAKER_01  Just add it to the list of Hamas and Diagnons.
3354.52 3355.66 SPEAKER_01  How many days are we in now?
3356.10 3357.22 SPEAKER_01  Like, yeah.
3357.38 3358.00 SPEAKER_01  It's, it's.
3358.00 3359.56 SPEAKER_01  I literally have lost count.
3359.96 3360.64 SPEAKER_01  Like, it's.
3360.64 3364.42 SPEAKER_02  It's getting, it's getting, uh, I mean, it has been ugly the whole time, but it's ugly.
3364.78 3366.26 SPEAKER_02  It gets uglier every day.
3366.58 3373.50 SPEAKER_02  It's very difficult to like, you know, we haven't spoken about this for a while, I suppose, because it's just like, what is there to say?
3373.84 3374.02 SPEAKER_00  Right.
3374.08 3378.18 SPEAKER_02  But, uh, yeah, this is, uh, this is only getting worse.
3378.18 3382.28 SPEAKER_01  Um, the word impunity feels like it's completely lost meaning at this point, right?
3382.36 3384.64 SPEAKER_01  Like impunity, it just took a meaningless word.
3384.92 3385.04 SPEAKER_01  Right.
3385.04 3393.80 SPEAKER_01  Uh, Israel have just, Israel have just been told again and again, you can do this and more and you will still get billions from the US.
3394.04 3395.20 SPEAKER_02  You'll still get all your weapons.
3395.50 3397.48 SPEAKER_02  Uh, you can take over parts of Syria.
3397.98 3398.34 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3398.58 3398.78 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3399.22 3399.62 SPEAKER_01  And what else?
3399.78 3400.30 SPEAKER_01  What's the scary thing?
3400.36 3413.78 SPEAKER_01  They now own, they now own like significant percentages of the water supply in, um, in Jordan, Syria, uh, not to mention, you know, Palestine because of the fact they've just done, they've just taken over bits of Syria.
3413.78 3415.24 SPEAKER_01  They've just decided, oh, that's ours now.
3415.34 3415.98 SPEAKER_01  That's ours now.
3416.04 3416.16 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3416.48 3419.98 SPEAKER_01  We need a buffer zone for our buffer zone and I need a buffer zone for my buffer zone.
3419.98 3420.16 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
3420.16 3420.24 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
3420.24 3420.68 SPEAKER_00  Exactly.
3421.58 3421.96 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
3422.58 3428.34 SPEAKER_04  And it's like, I, I fucked if I know what I can say to like do about any of this.
3428.54 3428.82 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3428.94 3433.14 SPEAKER_02  No, there's, I reminded of that, uh, the Kurt Vonnegut custard pie quote.
3433.44 3433.84 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3433.94 3434.26 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3434.26 3435.12 SPEAKER_02  For real war.
3435.12 3435.52 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3436.12 3441.56 SPEAKER_04  It's not as if anyone involved was like waiting to hear about like what podcasts thought about this, but fucking hell.
3442.00 3442.20 SPEAKER_02  Right.
3442.20 3453.22 SPEAKER_02  Or like, you know, mass protests or, uh, you know, any kind of, you know, writing your legislator, withholding your vote in an organized fashion.
3454.16 3454.42 SPEAKER_02  Nope.
3454.76 3455.08 SPEAKER_02  Fuck you.
3455.08 3457.68 SPEAKER_02  No, there's just not, nothing has worked.
3458.64 3461.98 SPEAKER_02  That thing has moved the needle an inch.
3462.32 3468.18 SPEAKER_01  Um, it's a real fucking damning and diamond on how evil our governments are.
3468.28 3468.44 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3468.44 3481.08 SPEAKER_04  I think this is how you get to the like incoherence as well as even the people who like, uh, think this is good and appraising it as still like learning the lesson that there are no levers that you can pull, right.
3481.34 3488.24 SPEAKER_04  Other than violence, uh, that there is nothing that you can do to make any of these governments listen to you.
3488.30 3495.88 SPEAKER_04  And what these people are learning from that is like, well, the only thing for it is these kind of like grandiose terroristic acts of violence, you know?
3496.26 3496.48 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3496.48 3499.00 SPEAKER_04  I think those don't work either.
3499.14 3501.26 SPEAKER_04  It's just, that's what they're relying on, you know?
3501.68 3502.02 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3502.12 3509.06 SPEAKER_01  The only thing that I've like, the only thing I've been doing is, is reminding people, um, that this is not just something that someone else is doing.
3509.06 3509.98 SPEAKER_01  And it's bad boohoo.
3510.08 3513.26 SPEAKER_01  This is like in the UK, we are sending arms.
3513.46 3515.78 SPEAKER_01  We are providing intelligence.
3515.78 3519.16 SPEAKER_01  We are flying our very expensive AWACS planes over the top.
3519.44 3533.24 SPEAKER_01  And we probably have boots on the ground, even though we're not like, it's, it's a, even though it's not being talked about officially, it's very likely we have boots on the ground in Israel in some form, whether it's advisement, whether it's the likelihood is, there's probably like 1500 BAE guys out there.
3533.38 3534.94 SPEAKER_01  Like we are out there.
3535.10 3536.10 SPEAKER_01  We are facilitating the center.
3536.26 3538.38 SPEAKER_01  So that's not even, you know, that's not even talking about the US.
3538.38 3539.20 SPEAKER_01  That's the UK.
3539.86 3543.84 SPEAKER_01  Um, and so we are absolutely, all of us have blood on our hands, whether we like it or not.
3543.86 3547.68 SPEAKER_01  And we should be reminding our MPs of that as frequently as we possibly can.
3548.20 3548.98 SPEAKER_02  So you were right.
3549.04 3550.10 SPEAKER_02  Remember the aid pier?
3550.30 3551.42 SPEAKER_02  They built the aid pier.
3551.42 3553.00 SPEAKER_02  And then they, I do.
3553.00 3558.04 SPEAKER_02  I drove like four trucks in and then used them to do a war crime and then dismantled the thing.
3558.38 3559.52 SPEAKER_02  A guy, a guy died.
3559.64 3566.60 SPEAKER_04  Like an American soldier died of like misadventure in the course of this, uh, building this pier and like a, and like an industrial accident.
3566.60 3569.32 SPEAKER_04  Um, so yeah, great record there.
3569.32 3574.16 SPEAKER_04  Do you ever, do you ever Jose Andres, the celebrity chef who also does a world central kitchen?
3574.52 3580.26 SPEAKER_02  Oh, you got the presidential medal of freedom after, uh, the administration killed some of his guys.
3580.26 3580.38 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3580.38 3583.50 SPEAKER_04  From, from the guy who helped kill a bunch of his staff.
3583.64 3583.86 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3584.06 3584.44 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3584.44 3595.26 SPEAKER_04  They were shooting at like, uh, at like WCK convoys, like, oh, not WCK, but like, um, uh, like NGO convoys like two days ago.
3595.34 3595.82 SPEAKER_04  Right.
3596.04 3596.56 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3596.66 3604.36 SPEAKER_04  Um, and the, the IDF is like fucking with, uh, the UN forces in Lebanon still, even after the kind of like withdrawals there.
3604.36 3620.26 SPEAKER_04  And it's just like, it's, it's, it's like fully a rogue state, but it's a state that's kind of like apprehended the way things are going, which is like, oh, so, you know, we can, we can, we're really, uh, we're really, uh, we're really, uh, we're really, uh, really kind of putting international humanitarian law to the test as to whether it's going to do anything.
3620.68 3621.28 SPEAKER_00  Jesus Christ.
3621.28 3624.26 SPEAKER_04  That's not going to be a settled question for a long time yet.
3624.34 3633.16 SPEAKER_04  I think you're, you know, as more and more evidence comes out about things that, you know, atrocities that, you know, uh, the, the IDF have committed in Gaza.
3633.82 3642.54 SPEAKER_04  Um, you know, I, I saw the thing, uh, that was like, uh, advice to, um, uh, like IDF soldiers traveling abroad in case you get arrested.
3642.54 3642.94 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3642.94 3648.98 SPEAKER_04  And it's like, uh, and the thing at the end of that was like, you know, the risk isn't going to decrease over time.
3649.02 3651.12 SPEAKER_04  It might in fact increase over time.
3651.28 3655.56 SPEAKER_04  Uh, so yeah, we don't know what, what shape that's going to take, but in the meantime,
3655.84 3663.14 SPEAKER_02  I guess they just started today, I believe, uh, blurring soldiers faces on television. I mean, yeah, that's great.
3663.22 3665.88 SPEAKER_02  Have they got them to stop posting TikToks of stealing?
3665.88 3666.38 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3667.64 3668.08 SPEAKER_00  Exactly.
3668.64 3669.04 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
3669.44 3678.52 SPEAKER_04  And, and, and like, I just, at this state level and the immediate term, I think Israel has just kind of made the correct bet that no one is going to stop it.
3678.52 3683.06 SPEAKER_04  And this is just how like international relations is just going to work for everyone from now on.
3683.20 3683.98 SPEAKER_02  It's going to be ugly.
3684.04 3684.66 SPEAKER_02  It's going to be ugly.
3684.66 3688.02 SPEAKER_02  Especially when Trump decides to invade Mexico or some bullshit.
3688.22 3688.34 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3688.34 3688.78 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3689.14 3695.40 SPEAKER_04  Well, I mean, this is the thing, like it's, it's kind of like, well, you can just do what you want pretty much.
3695.40 3705.50 SPEAKER_04  And there's a lot of countries that want to do shit like this, you know, Israel isn't like uniquely evil in the sense of being the only country that has done a genocide or wants to do a genocide.
3705.50 3709.72 SPEAKER_04  You see that with like Azerbaijan just as much, for instance, and Nagorno-Karabakh.
3709.90 3715.38 SPEAKER_04  And like, this is just going to be a thing that like is going to become normalized at this rate.
3715.38 3724.98 SPEAKER_04  And you combine that with like the kind of like, you know, billions of climate refugees and the whole thing takes on a real like children of men cast, right?
3724.98 3725.48 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3725.48 3726.48 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, absolutely right.
3726.48 3727.38 SPEAKER_02  I was about to say, yeah.
3727.50 3731.20 SPEAKER_02  I mean, you're going to, the only thing we can do is hope we run out of ammo.
3732.20 3736.54 SPEAKER_04  The only thing we can do is fucking give the UN nuclear weapons at this point.
3736.90 3740.98 SPEAKER_02  I mean, honestly though, yeah, I mean, if we could, you know, everyone could vote.
3741.40 3743.54 SPEAKER_02  Well, no, because there's the big United States veto.
3743.54 3744.54 SPEAKER_02  No, no, no.
3744.54 3744.96 SPEAKER_02  I see.
3745.08 3757.00 SPEAKER_04  I'm now, I'm now at the point where I'm just at the kind of desperation that people got to after the end of the first world war, where they're like, what if we had like an international air police to enforce, like, to enforce peace?
3757.44 3758.40 SPEAKER_04  That kind of thing.
3759.06 3761.28 SPEAKER_04  I'm just like, well, there's got to be something.
3761.40 3763.08 SPEAKER_04  There's got to be some solution out there.
3763.14 3764.04 SPEAKER_04  Maybe it's Basadism.
3764.36 3768.16 SPEAKER_04  Maybe we just have the fucking aliens take over because we're unfit to govern ourselves.
3768.16 3768.96 SPEAKER_02  Or the dolphins.
3769.50 3769.84 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3770.18 3770.50 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3771.26 3774.70 SPEAKER_02  Oh, the dolphins aren't getting away from the sexual assault allegations.
3774.70 3775.04 SPEAKER_02  No.
3775.72 3780.26 SPEAKER_04  I like to separate the art from the artist, you know, those cancel culture shits gone too far.
3780.74 3786.60 SPEAKER_04  You know, okay, maybe they didn't do some shit that was so good, but like, I saw them in a lot of, like, you know, nature documentaries.
3786.80 3787.46 SPEAKER_04  They're an inspiration.
3788.32 3788.72 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3789.56 3791.34 SPEAKER_04  Have you seen Dolphin Chinatown?
3791.34 3800.14 SPEAKER_02  That's so dolphin for, this is Chinatown.
3801.92 3803.04 SPEAKER_02  Very good, Roz.
3803.70 3804.72 SPEAKER_02  Oh, dear.
3805.04 3805.16 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3805.48 3806.34 SPEAKER_02  Delirium has said it.
3807.12 3807.60 SPEAKER_02  All right.
3807.68 3810.36 SPEAKER_02  Well, let's move on to some later news.
3810.66 3810.90 SPEAKER_04  Yay.
3813.16 3815.98 SPEAKER_04  All these guys hate each other and they're not even in power yet.
3816.50 3816.72 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3816.72 3822.42 SPEAKER_02  Trump and Musk have both said, immigration is good, actually.
3822.54 3825.84 SPEAKER_02  I was waiting for a politician to finally, you know, do this.
3825.92 3828.54 SPEAKER_02  It's just they're only talking about the H-1B program.
3828.76 3831.04 SPEAKER_03  We're annexing Canada, maybe, possibly, so.
3831.10 3831.82 SPEAKER_04  We'll get there.
3831.90 3832.54 SPEAKER_02  That's another thing.
3832.54 3832.84 SPEAKER_02  That's later.
3833.06 3833.24 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3834.08 3836.26 SPEAKER_04  But yeah, so this was the thing.
3836.72 3837.58 SPEAKER_04  Elon Musk.
3838.72 3843.30 SPEAKER_04  We didn't even include any of his, like, European crash outs, which I guess we'll get to in future episodes.
3843.30 3843.74 SPEAKER_02  Oh, right.
3843.80 3843.98 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3843.98 3848.22 SPEAKER_04  I genuinely think there's a non-zero chance Elon YouTube's himself.
3848.62 3851.14 SPEAKER_04  Like, I think it's up there.
3851.36 3851.86 SPEAKER_04  It's a possibility.
3852.12 3852.70 SPEAKER_04  Come on, baby.
3852.78 3852.96 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3853.04 3861.08 SPEAKER_04  I mean, this was the joke when he started doing Twisted Premium is, do you want to see what happened to the last guy who made me post on a forum and made me pay for it, you know?
3863.16 3863.56 SPEAKER_02  Like...
3863.56 3874.94 SPEAKER_02  So, there's been a split among the ascendant right wing about immigration in the sense of, okay, we need to keep out those, you know, dirty brown people.
3874.94 3877.00 SPEAKER_02  But we do want to bring in...
3877.00 3885.24 SPEAKER_02  But the other side is like, yes, but we do want to bring in the educated Indian people to work at our tech firms.
3885.94 3886.34 SPEAKER_02  Exploited.
3886.64 3886.94 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3887.94 3888.88 SPEAKER_04  Exploit their labor.
3889.26 3894.60 SPEAKER_04  You know, you hire a guy who's like a very specific kind of computer scientist and you
3894.60 3907.22 SPEAKER_02  pay him, like, stupidly low wages. Yeah, I was about to say this is a person who's put in, like, you know, fucking eight years of study at, you know, the most prestigious university in, like, Chandigarh.
3907.58 3911.26 SPEAKER_02  And, like, you're paying him, I don't know, 20 bucks an hour.
3911.68 3911.82 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3912.30 3916.46 SPEAKER_04  And he can't quit or get another job because then he'll get deported.
3916.98 3918.84 SPEAKER_04  And his wife is not allowed to work.
3918.98 3919.26 SPEAKER_04  Right.
3919.42 3919.66 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3919.66 3932.04 SPEAKER_04  And this sort of, like, nuclear heterosexual family where the wife isn't allowed to work, of course, triggers all of the worst chuds on the internet because they're racist, right?
3932.12 3936.62 SPEAKER_04  And because they are threatened by the existence of non-white people.
3937.66 3944.40 SPEAKER_04  And also there was a particularly faddish anti-Indian, specifically, racism kicking around.
3944.40 3945.50 SPEAKER_04  This is true.
3945.68 3948.56 SPEAKER_02  That's become a new fad, yeah.
3948.56 3948.76 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3949.46 3950.94 SPEAKER_01  And so, yeah.
3951.16 3951.74 SPEAKER_01  Maybe I'm wrong.
3951.84 3952.96 SPEAKER_01  It's a type of racism.
3953.56 3956.74 SPEAKER_01  The U.S. does a wondrous rainbow of racisms.
3956.94 3962.20 SPEAKER_01  But actually, that kind of racism isn't one I'm that familiar with popping up that much in the U.S.
3962.20 3962.68 SPEAKER_01  I don't know, maybe.
3962.84 3967.50 SPEAKER_04  It's sort of one that existed mostly on, like, the chans, pretty much.
3967.50 3967.68 SPEAKER_01  Right.
3967.68 3970.10 SPEAKER_04  Like, the image boards and then kind of grew from there, right?
3970.64 3977.58 SPEAKER_04  And it was kind of like, it was a meme through the kind of, like, sort of groiper bit of the far right.
3977.58 3977.80 SPEAKER_04  Right.
3977.80 3980.46 SPEAKER_04  Um, I feel fairly horrible.
3980.84 3981.60 SPEAKER_04  Like, you know, in this country.
3981.60 3987.28 SPEAKER_02  I feel like we've had sort of this rise of, this sort of rise of multicultural racism.
3987.50 3987.74 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3988.00 3993.02 SPEAKER_02  Where, like, the racists don't care the color of your skin as long as you're racist against someone.
3993.18 3993.46 SPEAKER_02  Right.
3993.46 3993.90 SPEAKER_04  Mm.
3995.90 3999.98 SPEAKER_04  That's, you know, they're putting that on the new unwoke Statue of Liberty.
4000.18 4000.52 SPEAKER_01  Wow.
4000.76 4001.44 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, exactly.
4001.44 4004.60 SPEAKER_01  Give us your racisms.
4004.60 4014.06 SPEAKER_04  The real sort of, like, counterforce here is, you know, guys like Elon Musk and Donald Trump who want cheap labor personally because it benefits them.
4014.20 4018.54 SPEAKER_04  Like, SpaceX and Tesla just don't work without H-1B visas.
4018.54 4019.82 SPEAKER_04  Um, yes.
4019.82 4030.86 SPEAKER_04  And also, uh, as a fun little tendency, uh, the, like, Indian upper class who are also racist but wish that you weren't racist against Indians.
4030.86 4042.42 SPEAKER_04  Um, this is a kind of, like, you know, because it's a fine tradition for, like, any immigrant from, like, any ethnicity anywhere in the world is to kick the ladder out from under you, right?
4042.70 4043.10 SPEAKER_04  Right.
4043.10 4047.20 SPEAKER_04  And that's something that you saw, like, white immigrants do but it's something that you're seeing here.
4047.28 4060.42 SPEAKER_04  And that's, like, you know, every immigrant's fondest dream is your grandkid, uh, achieve some kind of, like, high business or political office and is immediately the most racist person you've ever seen.
4060.42 4069.08 SPEAKER_02  Well, Vivek, Vivek Ramaswamy, the other guy who is at the Department of Government and Efficiency, has, um, he has, uh, started experimenting.
4069.08 4069.78 SPEAKER_02  Seems sort of stunned by it.
4070.04 4079.22 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, no, he seems to be starting to experiment with the idea, maybe I'll be accepted by the GOP base if I am racist.
4079.24 4079.56 SPEAKER_02  Nobody.
4079.78 4084.44 SPEAKER_02  And the people I have chosen to be racist against are white people.
4084.80 4086.52 SPEAKER_02  Well, this, this is, yeah, no.
4086.52 4086.88 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
4089.04 4091.06 SPEAKER_04  It's, it's, it's this kind of strange contortion, right?
4091.06 4096.98 SPEAKER_04  Because if you look at, like, uh, kind of, like, this same tendency in the UK, right?
4096.98 4102.64 SPEAKER_04  You have a lot of non-white immigrants that you can distinguish yourself by being racist against.
4102.76 4106.90 SPEAKER_04  And that's something that, like, whether that's Rishi Sunak or Kemi Badenok, uh, these are
4106.90 4111.20 SPEAKER_02  people who, like... You people, you people reinvented being racist against Polacks.
4111.20 4114.54 SPEAKER_04  I mean, true, but in this case, it's true, yeah.
4114.54 4127.00 SPEAKER_04  It's more like, um, sort of, like, coming from an immigrant background and then being still very racist against, uh, even people of, like, your own national background in that sense, right?
4127.54 4127.68 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
4127.68 4130.06 SPEAKER_04  Maybe I'm one of the good ones sort of approach, yeah.
4130.56 4132.08 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.
4132.24 4134.70 SPEAKER_04  Like, whenever Kemi Badenok talks about Nigeria, for instance.
4134.70 4153.12 SPEAKER_04  But, like, Vivek's deal was, uh, white people are on the outs because you watch too many cartoons and you don't know how to work, which had the, kind of, like, expected reaction from all of these, like, based European traditionalist guys, right?
4153.50 4156.16 SPEAKER_04  Of screaming and crying and shitting themselves.
4156.94 4162.06 SPEAKER_04  Um, and it's just, like, I wish these people every happiness with each other is the main thing.
4162.06 4162.70 SPEAKER_04  I know.
4163.02 4163.86 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, this is it.
4163.86 4165.88 SPEAKER_02  I understand how Omelas works now.
4166.80 4173.96 SPEAKER_02  Everyone, everyone became, everyone decided to be racist against one child.
4174.44 4174.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
4175.32 4177.30 SPEAKER_02  And then they all got along.
4179.22 4189.34 SPEAKER_04  My favorite, my favorite thing about this was, uh, the discourse got so bad that Elon remembered that he's South African, which he almost never does these days.
4189.34 4189.64 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, he doesn't do that.
4189.82 4191.04 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, this is it.
4191.04 4193.62 SPEAKER_01  I was like, oh, good on you, Elon.
4193.62 4196.50 SPEAKER_01  You know, remembering the apartheid bit of your upbringing.
4196.50 4197.92 SPEAKER_01  That's so nice.
4197.92 4204.12 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, no, so it remains to be said.
4204.22 4209.88 SPEAKER_04  Like, ultimately, this is something that I think bodes, if not well, then at least humorously for the next four years of hell.
4209.88 4210.88 SPEAKER_04  Oh, watch this.
4210.88 4211.56 SPEAKER_02  Watch this.
4211.64 4213.26 SPEAKER_02  This is gonna, this is gonna collapse.
4213.72 4214.42 SPEAKER_02  The coalition.
4215.06 4215.30 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
4215.64 4216.84 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, we're gonna see that.
4216.94 4219.72 SPEAKER_02  We're gonna see who in the GOP walks away from Omelas.
4220.16 4220.46 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
4220.46 4238.22 SPEAKER_01  Like, there are pictures from Mar-a-Lago, the, like, New Year's party, where, uh, Elon, uh, took his, like, like, infant child as a human shield, which is a strange thing.
4238.22 4243.18 SPEAKER_04  That motherfucker is stuffing that kid into a plate carrier like The Division.
4243.44 4246.92 SPEAKER_04  It's like, it's like Warzone.
4247.04 4248.12 SPEAKER_04  He's got, like, four kids.
4248.32 4250.04 SPEAKER_04  He's layering them on top of each other.
4250.04 4252.14 SPEAKER_03  You can't ever be too sure.
4252.14 4258.72 SPEAKER_04  I'm going after my kids holding triangles, sticking them in front of my sternum so that nobody shoots me.
4259.34 4260.26 SPEAKER_04  Oh, God.
4260.40 4263.72 SPEAKER_01  But literally, though, on the shoulders, walking into the party.
4264.04 4268.12 SPEAKER_01  But what's funny is that later on, there's a picture of these two within reasonable proximity of each other.
4268.68 4275.08 SPEAKER_01  And it's quite clear that, I mean, Trump is, let's run ourselves, a disgusting, unpleasant character.
4275.38 4280.80 SPEAKER_01  But he was looking repulsed at Musk, who is also a disgusting, repellent, unpleasant character.
4280.80 4283.74 SPEAKER_01  So, I, these two are, Donald Trump, right?
4283.74 4284.94 SPEAKER_04  It's not like so much, man.
4285.20 4292.48 SPEAKER_04  Donald Trump, Donald Trump enjoyed hanging out with, like, you know, Jeffrey Epstein and stuff due to their shared interest in being a rapist, right?
4292.56 4297.46 SPEAKER_04  But, like, Elon commits a far greater crime than that, which is being annoying in Trump's
4297.46 4297.70 SPEAKER_00  sense. Yeah.
4298.18 4300.90 SPEAKER_04  And I don't think you can, I don't think you can litigate that.
4300.98 4304.82 SPEAKER_04  I don't think you can argue that Elon Musk isn't annoying and isn't a bad hang.
4305.40 4311.26 SPEAKER_01  So, it just, it's just his vibes are, I mean, like, yeah, just like spending any time with him.
4311.34 4313.64 SPEAKER_01  It just, like, it just vives off.
4313.64 4314.24 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
4314.60 4319.42 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, I was about to say, I mean, they're both sexual assaultists and sexual abusers.
4319.58 4321.68 SPEAKER_01  That's, that's, these two, they've got that in common.
4321.84 4326.54 SPEAKER_01  But, yeah, no, apart from that, I think this is definitely like an oil and water type situation.
4327.10 4331.28 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, he's, like, one step up from, like, notch of Minecraft fame.
4331.28 4331.82 SPEAKER_02  Oh, wow.
4332.20 4333.54 SPEAKER_02  In terms of how bad a hang.
4333.64 4334.72 SPEAKER_02  Dog deep in there, huh?
4335.18 4335.42 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
4335.90 4345.60 SPEAKER_01  I was, so I had a week in Tenerife, escaping from 2024 and running into 2025, somewhere that had sun and warmth, and it was lovely.
4345.70 4347.92 SPEAKER_01  And then you saw Kirsten the two-balking past you.
4348.66 4349.18 SPEAKER_01  Oh, my God.
4349.18 4354.76 SPEAKER_01  I swear to God, I saw Notch coming down the beach, on the same beach I was on.
4355.02 4355.68 SPEAKER_01  Oh, my God.
4355.68 4358.78 SPEAKER_04  I mean, it probably wasn't him, but it just made me think, God, can you imagine?
4358.78 4359.86 SPEAKER_04  Very distinctive looking.
4359.98 4362.54 SPEAKER_04  I mean, the thing that, the thing that I always think about.
4362.56 4366.62 SPEAKER_02  Still smells like the, the, the, the sort of rancid candy wall.
4366.82 4367.60 SPEAKER_02  The candy wall.
4367.74 4369.58 SPEAKER_04  I was going to mention the fucking candy wall.
4369.78 4369.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
4370.16 4377.64 SPEAKER_04  If you're not familiar with this detail, when, when, when he made his money off of Minecraft, he bought himself a beautiful house, which is presumably now on fire.
4378.24 4383.22 SPEAKER_04  So, I guess the, the candy is being cleansed and purified with flame right now.
4383.86 4386.20 SPEAKER_04  Eucalyptus trees are, like, blowing holes in it.
4386.20 4396.34 SPEAKER_04  Like, one of the things he installed in this kind of, like, ultimate kind of man-child act was he had, like, a wall that was filled with, like, candy, like, pick and mix, like, sweets.
4396.34 4396.60 SPEAKER_03  What?
4397.36 4400.38 SPEAKER_04  Which he then couldn't eat enough of.
4400.74 4405.02 SPEAKER_04  And so it just kind of, like, stayed inside this, like, Perspex wall.
4405.40 4406.50 SPEAKER_01  Just, like, roth-ing.
4406.50 4406.62 SPEAKER_01  Seriously.
4407.44 4414.80 SPEAKER_01  Just obviously that was, that, that's how that, those work when it's at Woolworths and you've got, like, nine and 50,000 people.
4414.80 4415.00 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
4416.00 4422.76 SPEAKER_02  That's definitely a house designed for entertaining and I don't know who Notch has to entertain.
4424.44 4428.74 SPEAKER_04  Minecraft, I don't think, was ever developed by someone who is, like, a good socializer.
4428.82 4430.32 SPEAKER_04  I think we can be clear about that.
4430.32 4436.34 SPEAKER_02  I gotta imagine the people working on it now are probably a little bit better.
4436.90 4437.26 SPEAKER_04  Hmm.
4437.76 4440.42 SPEAKER_04  I mean, you know, starting from a really low bar.
4440.54 4440.82 SPEAKER_02  Maybe.
4441.02 4444.04 SPEAKER_04  Also, fucking Donald Trump's looking well.
4444.74 4445.62 SPEAKER_04  He's looking...
4446.22 4447.46 SPEAKER_04  He's looking quite true in this picture.
4447.58 4448.72 SPEAKER_02  He doesn't have any time for this.
4448.72 4449.60 SPEAKER_02  He's crazy, I think.
4449.64 4452.98 SPEAKER_02  I was about to say, yeah, no, that's, you know, here's the thing, though.
4453.40 4455.62 SPEAKER_02  The new MAGA hats, I don't like them.
4455.74 4457.06 SPEAKER_02  I don't think they're well-proportioned.
4457.06 4458.28 SPEAKER_02  I didn't like the old ones, either.
4458.28 4460.42 SPEAKER_02  They're too busy, right?
4460.50 4462.72 SPEAKER_02  Adding the flag on the side, I think, is too much.
4463.24 4464.96 SPEAKER_02  But the text is too big.
4465.04 4465.60 SPEAKER_02  They are not...
4465.60 4469.58 SPEAKER_02  They do not have the same je ne sais quoi of the first MAGA hats.
4469.68 4480.76 SPEAKER_04  It's like, what if the Nazis had got in for, like, you know, had briefly had an interregnum, got back in and gone, okay, so the swastika's got, like, serifs on it now instead of...
4480.76 4481.30 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, exactly.
4481.30 4483.74 SPEAKER_01  It's the Superman and Lois 90s font, right?
4484.08 4485.18 SPEAKER_01  That's what it reminds me of.
4485.18 4489.62 SPEAKER_01  I saw someone wearing it on the train.
4489.62 4493.46 SPEAKER_04  I think one of the most pathetic things I've ever seen is Elon's dark MAGA hat.
4493.82 4496.12 SPEAKER_04  Oh, god, the dark MAGA shit.
4496.12 4497.68 SPEAKER_02  With the Harry Potter font.
4498.90 4499.70 SPEAKER_02  That's terrible.
4500.18 4507.12 SPEAKER_02  No, I saw someone wearing the MAGA hat on M-Track about a week ago, and I was like, that's way worse than the old hat.
4507.28 4507.50 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
4507.50 4508.26 SPEAKER_02  I'm sorry.
4508.70 4510.86 SPEAKER_02  This campaign has decayed.
4511.36 4511.68 SPEAKER_02  It's crazy.
4511.68 4515.08 SPEAKER_02  It's going to be far, far less entertaining than 2016.
4515.52 4516.26 SPEAKER_02  This tape is real?
4516.26 4516.84 SPEAKER_02  Through 2020, I think.
4516.84 4517.32 SPEAKER_03  Remember the piss tape?
4517.50 4517.66 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
4517.66 4518.36 SPEAKER_03  Remember when we had fun with that?
4518.36 4519.32 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, I have that hat.
4519.40 4519.88 SPEAKER_03  I know you do.
4520.62 4520.82 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
4520.88 4522.32 SPEAKER_04  The piss tape is real.
4522.44 4522.94 SPEAKER_04  The piss tape...
4522.94 4524.50 SPEAKER_04  I think we can be absolutely clear about that.
4524.58 4526.46 SPEAKER_04  I'm still a true believer in the piss tape.
4527.24 4529.02 SPEAKER_02  Nah, let's hope that drops at some point.
4529.10 4529.26 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
4529.40 4531.00 SPEAKER_02  That'll be one bright spot.
4531.00 4532.14 SPEAKER_04  Day one, yeah.
4532.40 4533.14 SPEAKER_02  You know, just...
4533.14 4533.70 SPEAKER_02  Day one.
4533.78 4536.64 SPEAKER_04  Putin opens the oldest media vault and is like...
4536.64 4540.00 SPEAKER_02  Putin opens the oldest vault, takes out the piss tape.
4540.96 4545.60 SPEAKER_04  It's like a shitty quality WMV because it was filmed in Moscow in like 2000.
4546.36 4551.44 SPEAKER_02  That's how he's going to negotiate with Trump for Ukrainian unconditional surrender.
4553.64 4555.52 SPEAKER_04  Zelensky having to be like, what the fuck is...
4555.52 4559.64 SPEAKER_04  Why did you send me a video that requires a real player codec?
4559.64 4561.14 SPEAKER_04  What a...
4561.14 4563.32 SPEAKER_01  Recorded on a flip phone.
4563.32 4563.72 SPEAKER_01  MPV.
4563.72 4565.70 SPEAKER_04  Unregistered hypercam too.
4570.18 4574.18 SPEAKER_04  And it's just Trump getting like, bathed in Russian hooker piss.
4574.54 4574.74 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
4576.18 4576.78 SPEAKER_04  Thank you.
4577.08 4577.88 SPEAKER_04  There is a detail.
4577.98 4579.64 SPEAKER_04  There's another detail about this photo, by the way.
4579.64 4580.82 SPEAKER_00  No, I don't want to know another detail.
4581.48 4582.18 SPEAKER_04  No, there is.
4582.18 4582.50 SPEAKER_04  There is.
4582.60 4584.62 SPEAKER_04  Because it's the dumbest thing ever.
4584.74 4586.54 SPEAKER_04  It's the stupidest, lowest stakes lie.
4586.54 4595.04 SPEAKER_04  But I remember last year when Elon Musk accepted on stage an Israeli dog tag.
4595.32 4596.70 SPEAKER_04  An IDF dog tag.
4597.28 4607.52 SPEAKER_04  And he said in front of God and everyone in his fucking weird accent, I am going to wear this until all the hostages are free.
4607.70 4609.66 SPEAKER_04  And he isn't fucking wearing it.
4609.66 4615.66 SPEAKER_04  So, he got bored, and he, yeah, he's betrayed the IDF, and I can only hope- No.
4615.66 4617.00 SPEAKER_04  Can't say that on YouTube.
4617.00 4619.30 SPEAKER_04  We can't say that, I don't think.
4619.30 4620.52 SPEAKER_03  But, yeah, you're so big.
4620.52 4621.52 SPEAKER_04  Suspect.
4621.52 4622.52 SPEAKER_00  Just bleep.
4622.52 4623.68 SPEAKER_02  Just bleep accordingly.
4623.84 4624.56 SPEAKER_02  Bleep accordingly.
4624.56 4632.44 SPEAKER_02  Based on the widespread destruction in Gaza, I suspect all the hostages may be free of this mortal coil.
4632.44 4633.06 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
4633.06 4635.76 SPEAKER_02  They slipped the silly bones of Earth to touch the face of God.
4635.76 4636.06 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
4636.50 4636.82 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
4637.58 4638.02 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
4638.12 4643.94 SPEAKER_04  If nothing else, it beats out the Russians for worst KD ratio in a hostage rescue operation.
4644.00 4645.68 SPEAKER_04  Congratulations, you fucking morons.
4646.04 4647.42 SPEAKER_04  It's bad to say, yeah.
4647.66 4649.54 SPEAKER_04  It helps if you're not trying, you know?
4649.54 4649.74 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
4650.04 4650.82 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, exactly.
4650.98 4652.94 SPEAKER_02  This is more of a game of-
4652.94 4655.10 SPEAKER_01  I think they were trying. I'm pretty sure the IDF were trying.
4655.18 4657.62 SPEAKER_01  They were just trying to kill as many of the hostages as we were.
4657.62 4659.36 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, that's true, yeah.
4659.42 4665.16 SPEAKER_02  Those guys who came out, who were the hostages with the white flags, the IDF were just like, I just shot all of them.
4667.16 4669.42 SPEAKER_04  Actually, straight up, do feel bad for those guys.
4669.64 4671.48 SPEAKER_02  Like, what are you gonna do?
4671.98 4672.20 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
4672.44 4675.40 SPEAKER_02  You don't move to Israel.
4675.58 4676.18 SPEAKER_02  That's what you do.
4676.58 4677.84 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, no, I know.
4678.16 4678.68 SPEAKER_02  To hit the bricks.
4678.68 4679.96 SPEAKER_02  That's a real, like, yeah.
4680.18 4680.98 SPEAKER_02  I get it, though.
4681.32 4681.62 SPEAKER_02  Yep.
4682.58 4684.66 SPEAKER_02  Well, in other news.
4684.66 4687.62 SPEAKER_03  Oh, yeah, that's right.
4687.68 4688.42 SPEAKER_02  We're under siege.
4688.98 4689.24 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
4689.64 4690.36 SPEAKER_02  Everything's a drone.
4690.96 4691.56 SPEAKER_02  Everything's a drone.
4691.94 4693.12 SPEAKER_02  There's drones everywhere.
4693.30 4695.64 SPEAKER_02  There's drones everywhere in South Jersey.
4695.80 4697.70 SPEAKER_02  I saw a big drone a couple nights ago.
4698.28 4700.14 SPEAKER_01  So this is ages ago now, this news.
4700.30 4701.72 SPEAKER_01  But is it still happening?
4701.90 4704.38 SPEAKER_01  Is it still, like, ticking around in, like, local news and stuff?
4704.38 4705.56 SPEAKER_01  I think there's still drones happening.
4706.00 4706.36 SPEAKER_01  Are there?
4706.98 4709.08 SPEAKER_01  I believe there's still drones happening.
4709.08 4716.12 SPEAKER_04  Have you- One of the classic- I'm cursed to just have a memory for tweets, but one of the classic tweets- I don't remember who it was.
4716.18 4716.44 SPEAKER_04  Sorry.
4716.66 4718.22 SPEAKER_04  You can credit it if Devin can find it.
4718.30 4727.88 SPEAKER_04  Where the guy's like, my buddy says that he saw an alien, but he just saw, like, a regular plane, and he looked at it with binoculars, and when he looked in the cockpit, there was an alien flying it.
4728.64 4739.94 SPEAKER_04  That's- I am awaiting the drone equivalent of that, of, like, you look in the cockpit of a plane, and it's a little quadcopter, just, like, hanging on to the-
4739.94 4752.78 SPEAKER_02  I mean, we didn't get a chance to talk about the drone panic when it was at its height, but, yeah, apparently in New Jersey and parts of Pennsylvania and- Parts of Delaware, I think.
4752.78 4753.36 SPEAKER_02  Parts of Maryland.
4753.78 4754.08 SPEAKER_02  Maybe not.
4754.08 4762.28 SPEAKER_02  Um, there are- There is a huge- A swarm of potentially Iranian drones- Of course they're Iranian!
4762.48 4762.74 SPEAKER_02  Yep.
4762.82 4763.20 SPEAKER_02  Yep, yep, yep.
4763.20 4763.36 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
4763.50 4763.66 SPEAKER_02  Uh-huh.
4763.72 4763.98 SPEAKER_02  Uh-huh.
4764.06 4775.66 SPEAKER_02  Which are doing secret surveillance or something of, like, I don't know, uh, Vineland, New Jersey, to get a look at the glass factory or something.
4775.80 4776.32 SPEAKER_02  I don't know.
4776.32 4783.84 SPEAKER_04  I mean, this is kind of interesting, right, because this followed on the heels of similar reports in England.
4784.08 4786.02 SPEAKER_04  I think there were some in Germany as well, right?
4786.40 4799.98 SPEAKER_04  Uh, and the ones in the UK were, like, kind of acknowledged by the, like, the US and by us as being, like, yeah, there were some drones, we don't know what the deal with them was, we're investigating, then no one heard anything else about it.
4799.98 4808.56 SPEAKER_04  Um, and then, and then all of a sudden, everyone in New Jersey decided to go out and try and shoot down the nearest, like, 737.
4808.56 4809.16 SPEAKER_04  At Staten Island.
4809.30 4810.02 SPEAKER_04  Don't forget Staten Island.
4810.54 4811.20 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, at Staten Island.
4811.20 4812.12 SPEAKER_04  Yep, yep.
4812.18 4816.70 SPEAKER_04  Which is really, like, you know, muddying the waters in the sense that maybe there was something there, I don't know.
4816.78 4828.00 SPEAKER_04  We saw with the, like, spy balloon shit, uh, and all of the, like, quote-unquote UFO videos from the West Coast that, like, probably some secret drone shit is happening somewhere at any given time.
4828.08 4828.34 SPEAKER_04  Oh, sure.
4828.34 4836.98 SPEAKER_04  Like, just by, like, law of averages, it probably doesn't involve, like, United Airlines flying over your house in the same pattern that they do every day.
4836.98 4837.48 SPEAKER_02  Right.
4837.48 4839.66 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, or, like, a FedEx cargo flight.
4839.66 4844.12 SPEAKER_02  Um, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say, no one saw a secret drone.
4844.12 4845.12 SPEAKER_02  No.
4845.12 4846.62 SPEAKER_02  Because if it's a secret drone...
4846.62 4847.62 SPEAKER_02  You'd never see it.
4847.62 4849.62 SPEAKER_02  Why were the lights on?
4849.62 4850.62 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
4850.62 4851.62 SPEAKER_02  Good question.
4851.62 4856.44 SPEAKER_04  Just turning on the, like, marking lights on my secret Iranian drone.
4856.44 4857.44 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, exactly.
4857.44 4858.44 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, exactly.
4858.44 4860.44 SPEAKER_04  Respect for the Federal Aviation Authority.
4860.44 4861.44 None  Yeah.
4861.44 4867.08 SPEAKER_04  Just like, well, the entire United States is the greatest Satan apart from the Federal Aviation
4867.08 4870.90 SPEAKER_02  of the Air Force. That is kind of true, though.
4870.90 4873.26 SPEAKER_02  Actually, the FAA is the only good agency.
4873.26 4880.26 SPEAKER_04  Doing, like, Iranian worldview, and it's like, my enemy is not the American people.
4880.26 4881.90 SPEAKER_04  It's not the American political leadership.
4881.90 4883.90 SPEAKER_04  It is specifically the FAA.
4883.90 4888.90 SPEAKER_04  I mean, I guess that was kind of Al-Qaeda's deal, too.
4888.90 4889.90 SPEAKER_04  But, like...
4889.90 4890.90 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
4890.90 4891.90 SPEAKER_02  The, uh, the...
4891.90 4892.90 SPEAKER_02  Whatchamacallit.
4892.90 4903.90 SPEAKER_02  Um, the best one was, of course, former Maryland governor, uh, Larry Hogan, whose Twitter handle is still Governor Larry Hogan, posting, look at all these, uh...
4903.90 4904.90 SPEAKER_02  Cope.
4904.90 4905.90 SPEAKER_04  See?
4905.90 4908.90 SPEAKER_04  That's like my Twitter handle still being, like, 99 kilograms November, Cal.
4908.90 4909.90 SPEAKER_04  What did he do?
4909.90 4916.10 SPEAKER_02  He got into office, he canceled the red line in Baltimore, then he got cancer, then he left office.
4916.10 4926.10 SPEAKER_02  Um, anyway, so, you know, he was like, look at all these drones in the sky, and he posted a picture of the fucking constellation Orion.
4926.10 4927.10 SPEAKER_02  Um...
4927.10 4929.10 SPEAKER_01  What was that one?
4929.10 4936.90 SPEAKER_01  There was another elected official who genuinely posted a picture of a, of a, like, film prop TIE fighter?
4936.90 4937.90 SPEAKER_01  Mm-hmm.
4937.90 4939.90 SPEAKER_01  On a low loader on its way along an interstate somewhere.
4939.90 4940.90 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
4940.90 4947.90 SPEAKER_04  They genuinely had, like, rural cops driving around watching the skies for this shit.
4947.90 4948.90 SPEAKER_04  Oh my god.
4948.90 4960.90 SPEAKER_04  Like, they were gonna do anything, and, like, you know, there were reporters doing ride-alongs, uh, with these poor fucking idiot cops being like, yeah, we don't know, we just thought we'd better keep an eye on it, because people are worried.
4960.90 4961.90 SPEAKER_04  And it's like...
4961.90 4962.90 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, we got, like, six...
4962.90 4963.90 SPEAKER_04  That is an airplane.
4963.90 4967.90 SPEAKER_02  No, like, six cops shooting at the International Space Station.
4967.90 4968.90 SPEAKER_02  Stop resisting!
4968.90 4973.90 SPEAKER_04  I'm not gonna say anything about shooting at the International Space Station.
4973.90 4977.90 SPEAKER_04  No, resist, yeah, don't say anything about you.
4977.90 4978.90 SPEAKER_01  Go on, go on.
4978.90 4979.90 SPEAKER_04  I guess there is a real thing here about, like...
4979.90 4980.90 SPEAKER_04  Now he has restraint.
4980.90 4991.90 SPEAKER_04  Listen, I think Elon Musk should be assassinated by Mossad, that's all there is to it.
4991.90 4993.90 SPEAKER_04  Listen, there we go again.
4993.90 4994.90 SPEAKER_04  I just...
4994.90 4996.90 SPEAKER_04  I want them to give him a pager.
4996.90 5012.90 SPEAKER_04  The thing is, right, there is an actual point here about how poorly equipped people are to know anything about, like, civil aviation, even though it's a thing that, like, has been a sort of technology to which most people have had some form of exposure since, like, I don't know, the 50s.
5012.90 5016.90 SPEAKER_04  And it's like, you can't even recognize an airplane.
5016.90 5017.90 SPEAKER_04  Like, it's...
5017.90 5020.90 SPEAKER_04  This is not, like, difficult, it's not new.
5020.90 5031.90 SPEAKER_04  It's just, you're not used to looking at stuff in the sky, and you look at it and you're like, that's fucking, like, the Islamic Republic coming to blow up Danbury, Connecticut.
5031.90 5032.90 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, exactly.
5032.90 5034.90 SPEAKER_01  I think it's like, it goes even deeper than that.
5034.90 5035.90 SPEAKER_01  They hate our hats.
5035.90 5036.90 SPEAKER_04  It's like...
5036.90 5038.90 SPEAKER_01  No, only servants.
5038.90 5043.90 SPEAKER_01  It goes back to the incoherence thing, it's like, people have just got absolute...
5043.90 5051.90 SPEAKER_01  Okay, some people are just able to start with, but a lot of people are just suspending their own awareness because they just have no idea what to believe.
5051.90 5053.90 SPEAKER_01  They're not even believing their own senses anymore.
5053.90 5056.90 SPEAKER_01  That's not a good situation to be in from a political perspective.
5056.90 5057.90 SPEAKER_04  This is the thing, right?
5057.90 5060.90 SPEAKER_04  I've had this feeling for a while, I think everybody has, right?
5060.90 5062.90 SPEAKER_04  And I don't know whether there's anything to it.
5062.90 5076.90 SPEAKER_04  I don't know whether it's just kind of, like, mass hysteria because everything feels off, or, like, some kind of cognitive bias, or I'm sure people will tell me it's, like, all long COVID, or maybe, like, increasing CO2 in the atmosphere or something.
5076.90 5082.90 SPEAKER_04  But it really does feel like everybody is getting dumber and, like, angrier and crazier all the time.
5082.90 5083.90 SPEAKER_04  Rain poisoning, yeah.
5083.90 5096.90 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, and the only thing that's, like, kind of keeping me, like, contextualizing that is how much stuff from, like, I don't know, like, the 60s and the 70s is also, like, it feels as if everyone is getting dumber and crazier all the time.
5096.90 5101.90 SPEAKER_04  Because, I don't know, it just feels like we're in that kind of cultural moment, I guess.
5101.90 5102.90 SPEAKER_04  You know?
5102.90 5111.90 SPEAKER_04  And that's not to discount fucking COVID or CO2 or whatever, like, you know, future pandemic, past pandemic,
5111.90 5112.90 SPEAKER_02  you've got the land out of the gas.
5112.90 5120.90 SPEAKER_04  The pandemic is fucking around with people right now, but, like, it's just, like, I don't know. It really feels bad out there, you know?
5120.90 5125.90 SPEAKER_02  Was there a period of history where it felt like everyone was getting smarter and saner?
5125.90 5126.90 SPEAKER_02  That's my question.
5126.90 5127.90 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, it's called the 1990s.
5127.90 5128.90 SPEAKER_02  And then it ended.
5128.90 5129.90 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, it ended.
5129.90 5130.90 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, it ended.
5130.90 5131.90 SPEAKER_02  Famously ended, yeah.
5131.90 5132.90 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, nah.
5132.90 5140.90 SPEAKER_02  Thank God, uh, what's-his-face spoke it into existence.
5140.90 5142.90 SPEAKER_02  Francis Fukuyama, you piece of shit.
5142.90 5144.90 SPEAKER_02  We could have kept it going.
5144.90 5145.90 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
5145.90 5152.90 SPEAKER_04  And has access to the lathe of hell, where the thing that you were saying comes the opposite of true.
5152.90 5153.90 SPEAKER_04  False, I guess.
5153.90 5163.90 SPEAKER_02  So, anyway, so far, no one has blinded a pilot with a green laser, but I assume that- I don't think this has fully gone away, the drone thing, so I assume someone will do it.
5163.90 5172.90 SPEAKER_01  100% of FedEx 777 is getting spread across somewhere, because some angry kid shined a little laser pen for the way that happened.
5172.90 5177.90 SPEAKER_02  Just, like, short approach to Newark airport and lands on the turnpike by mistake, yeah.
5177.90 5178.90 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
5178.90 5179.90 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
5179.90 5183.90 SPEAKER_04  Well, I mean, it should be up here these days, because of future story.
5183.90 5184.90 SPEAKER_04  Congestion price.
5184.90 5185.90 SPEAKER_04  Oh, yeah.
5185.90 5188.90 SPEAKER_02  No, there's a lot of people going around is the problem.
5188.90 5189.90 SPEAKER_02  Oh, damn.
5189.90 5190.90 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
5190.90 5193.90 SPEAKER_02  Well, but sticking to transportation news...
5193.90 5194.90 SPEAKER_02  Oh, no.
5194.90 5197.90 SPEAKER_02  Who the fuck is this guy?
5197.90 5199.90 SPEAKER_02  We're ostensibly a train podcast, so...
5199.90 5200.90 SPEAKER_02  Are we?
5200.90 5202.90 SPEAKER_02  Or we talk about trains a lot.
5202.90 5207.90 SPEAKER_02  Let's talk about Donald Trump's transportation secretary nominee, Sean Duffy.
5207.90 5208.90 SPEAKER_02  Oh, I mean, that was a real, like...
5208.90 5209.90 SPEAKER_04  Oh, God.
5209.90 5211.90 SPEAKER_04  He made that decision while on the toilet.
5211.90 5212.90 SPEAKER_04  Right, yes.
5212.90 5213.90 SPEAKER_04  Like, I don't think...
5213.90 5214.90 SPEAKER_04  Right, yes.
5214.90 5215.90 SPEAKER_00  There are a whole bunch of...
5215.90 5216.90 SPEAKER_00  Speaking of log rollers...
5216.90 5217.90 SPEAKER_04  ...appointments that would just...
5217.90 5221.90 SPEAKER_04  That were just, like, not a priority for Donald Trump.
5221.90 5222.90 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
5222.90 5223.90 SPEAKER_04  Like, this would be one.
5223.90 5224.90 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
5224.90 5225.90 SPEAKER_02  Oh, he is...
5225.90 5228.90 SPEAKER_02  Sean Duffy was a competitive log roller.
5228.90 5229.90 SPEAKER_02  You're joking.
5229.90 5230.90 SPEAKER_02  You're shitting me.
5230.90 5231.90 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
5231.90 5234.90 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, he was a competitive log roller when he was younger.
5234.90 5236.90 SPEAKER_01  I take it that's not...
5236.90 5238.90 SPEAKER_01  That's not caber tossing.
5238.90 5240.90 SPEAKER_01  So that's just rolling the log.
5240.90 5243.90 SPEAKER_01  It's not picking it up end on end and flipping it like...
5243.90 5244.90 SPEAKER_01  No, like in a river, right?
5244.90 5246.90 SPEAKER_02  This is in a river, right?
5246.90 5247.90 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
5247.90 5255.90 SPEAKER_02  So I think there's either you're rolling the log yourself or there's two people rolling the log and they're trying to knock the other one off.
5255.90 5256.90 SPEAKER_02  Oh, I see.
5256.90 5258.90 SPEAKER_01  Like American gladiases.
5258.90 5259.90 SPEAKER_02  Yep.
5259.90 5265.90 SPEAKER_01  So this guy looks like I imagine most, like, federal bureaucrats look.
5265.90 5270.90 SPEAKER_01  As in, like, too young, wearing too paisley-ish a tie.
5270.90 5271.90 SPEAKER_01  Glassy-eyed.
5271.90 5274.90 SPEAKER_01  And just looking very ill-equipped to cope with the world.
5274.90 5278.90 SPEAKER_02  They got the anti-Pete Buttigieg shot.
5278.90 5282.90 SPEAKER_04  He's got a fascinating kind of baldness coming in where it's coming...
5282.90 5284.90 SPEAKER_04  Or like he's balding from under.
5284.90 5285.90 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5285.90 5286.90 SPEAKER_03  Like right here, yeah.
5286.90 5293.90 SPEAKER_01  Also he's got boy band sort of gel in his hair as well, which is an interesting move.
5293.90 5296.90 SPEAKER_04  Can I call Donald Trump a homophobic slur?
5296.90 5297.90 SPEAKER_04  No.
5297.90 5298.90 SPEAKER_04  I think I have done before.
5298.90 5299.90 SPEAKER_04  Okay.
5299.90 5300.90 SPEAKER_04  Damn.
5300.90 5303.90 SPEAKER_04  Well, that was all the content I had for this segment, so you guys finish it out.
5303.90 5306.90 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, me and Nova just like, who this guy?
5306.90 5307.90 SPEAKER_01  I don't know.
5307.90 5308.90 SPEAKER_01  I don't know.
5308.90 5309.90 SPEAKER_02  Tell us about him, Russ.
5309.90 5312.90 SPEAKER_02  He was, I believe, a congressman from Wisconsin.
5312.90 5313.90 SPEAKER_02  Wisconsin maybe.
5313.90 5315.90 SPEAKER_02  Maybe it was Minnesota.
5315.90 5316.90 SPEAKER_02  Maybe it was Michigan.
5316.90 5318.90 SPEAKER_02  I think it was one of those, something up there.
5318.90 5321.90 SPEAKER_02  Great Lakes, Northwest Great Lakes area.
5321.90 5322.90 SPEAKER_02  Ooh, that's a...
5322.90 5323.90 SPEAKER_02  Wisconsin, I think.
5323.90 5329.90 SPEAKER_02  He was, he was, he has no transportation experience that I have been able to discern.
5329.90 5330.90 SPEAKER_02  Apart from the log rolling.
5330.90 5332.90 SPEAKER_02  He was on Road Rules All Stars.
5332.90 5338.90 SPEAKER_02  He was on MTV's Real Life Boston and then Road Rules All Star.
5338.90 5339.90 SPEAKER_02  Real World Boston.
5339.90 5340.90 SPEAKER_01  Uh-huh.
5340.90 5343.90 SPEAKER_01  So he's a campy TV personality like the president will be.
5343.90 5344.90 SPEAKER_01  Okay, cool.
5344.90 5345.90 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
5345.90 5346.90 SPEAKER_03  He's on Fox News.
5346.90 5347.90 SPEAKER_03  He hired a guy off the TV.
5347.90 5348.90 SPEAKER_03  He was definitely shitting.
5348.90 5349.90 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, he was definitely shitting.
5349.90 5355.90 SPEAKER_02  No, Donald Trump, Donald Trump saw this guy was in a series where he was in an RV for a long time.
5355.90 5358.90 SPEAKER_02  And he was like, yeah, that guy, he's the Transportation Secretary.
5358.90 5359.90 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
5359.90 5360.90 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
5360.90 5361.90 SPEAKER_02  Yep.
5361.90 5364.90 SPEAKER_04  Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.
5364.90 5365.90 SPEAKER_04  I...
5365.90 5366.90 SPEAKER_04  I...
5366.90 5367.90 SPEAKER_04  Okay, right.
5367.90 5384.90 SPEAKER_04  There is something funny about Pete Buttigieg having been Secretary of Transportation for four years, having left no imprint or legacy on the office besides East Palestine, and then has to hand it over, turn over the keys to the RV idiot.
5384.90 5385.90 SPEAKER_04  That's...
5385.90 5386.90 SPEAKER_04  That's pleasing to me.
5386.90 5387.90 SPEAKER_04  That's a part of a degree from St. Mary's.
5387.90 5388.90 SPEAKER_04  St. Mary's.
5388.90 5389.90 SPEAKER_04  Oh, wow.
5389.90 5390.90 SPEAKER_02  Okay.
5390.90 5391.90 SPEAKER_02  Okay, sure.
5391.90 5406.90 SPEAKER_02  I believe he also has done some lobbying for the airline industry, which is important because Transportation Secretary is kind of like, well, you are in control of a lot of agencies, but the only one that does anything is the FAA.
5406.90 5415.90 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, and the only thing the FAA does is stop doing anything, make sure that anything that the NTSB suggests gets delayed as long as possible.
5415.90 5418.90 SPEAKER_01  That's kind of what the FAA's job seems to be.
5418.90 5423.90 SPEAKER_02  I mean, you know, I think at this point we are in a position where the safety record is pretty good.
5423.90 5424.90 SPEAKER_02  I mean, it's been a long time since we've had...
5424.90 5425.90 SPEAKER_01  Oh, it is.
5425.90 5426.90 SPEAKER_01  Oh, for sure.
5426.90 5427.90 SPEAKER_01  ...notality in any sense.
5427.90 5428.90 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, they're still...
5428.90 5429.90 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
5429.90 5431.90 SPEAKER_01  I'm not a big FAA fan, but...
5431.90 5432.90 SPEAKER_02  You will be.
5432.90 5439.90 SPEAKER_02  But if you look at other agencies, like FRA doesn't do anything.
5439.90 5442.90 SPEAKER_02  I'll talk about the FRA in a second.
5442.90 5443.90 SPEAKER_02  What else?
5443.90 5457.90 SPEAKER_02  You know, the big thing he's in control of, I guess, is going to be dispersing funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, because a lot of that is still in the planning stage.
5457.90 5469.90 SPEAKER_02  Um, so essentially, uh, Biden passed this huge infrastructure bill and, uh, Trump is going to make all the decisions about who gets what money.
5469.90 5470.90 SPEAKER_02  Great.
5470.90 5473.90 SPEAKER_04  Well, it's going to have to be supply lines for the invasion of Canada, first of all.
5473.90 5474.90 SPEAKER_04  So maybe...
5474.90 5475.90 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
5475.90 5482.90 SPEAKER_04  ...high speed rail to, you know, Wisconsin, uh, and, and, like, upstate New York.
5482.90 5485.90 SPEAKER_02  Uh, Wisconsin doesn't like, uh, high speed rail.
5485.90 5490.90 SPEAKER_04  I mean, they're going to have to like it when there's trains full of, like, Abrams tanks going north.
5490.90 5491.90 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, they'll learn.
5491.90 5497.90 SPEAKER_02  So maybe, maybe we could briefly talk about, okay, uh, what, what does this mean for inner city passenger rail?
5497.90 5500.90 SPEAKER_02  Um, are those passengers wearing multicam or not?
5500.90 5502.90 SPEAKER_02  Uh, good question.
5502.90 5504.90 SPEAKER_02  This is the M track connects us map.
5504.90 5510.90 SPEAKER_02  This is, uh, supposed to be, you know, what a lot of that infrastructure funding was supposed to go to.
5510.90 5512.90 SPEAKER_02  The light blue lines are new services.
5512.90 5515.90 SPEAKER_02  The yellow lines are enhanced services.
5515.90 5517.90 SPEAKER_02  The dark blue lines are existing services.
5517.90 5523.90 SPEAKER_02  Um, and what you can sort of look at here is, uh, what happens now?
5523.90 5525.90 SPEAKER_02  I think a lot of this just doesn't happen.
5525.90 5532.90 SPEAKER_02  Uh, maybe you get some like patronage, uh, stuff that goes to, uh, I don't know, North Carolina.
5532.90 5536.90 SPEAKER_02  Um, or like Virginia, but this is going to be very, very determined.
5536.90 5550.90 SPEAKER_02  I think on, okay, who delivered the votes for Trump and who has a state legislature that is sufficiently committed to like passenger rail that they're not going to say, oh, that's communism.
5550.90 5551.90 SPEAKER_02  They want the money.
5551.90 5552.90 SPEAKER_02  Sure.
5552.90 5554.90 SPEAKER_02  Um, which is what happened in Wisconsin.
5554.90 5559.90 SPEAKER_01  To be fair, everywhere voted for Trump, but the places that think trains are communism is also everywhere.
5559.90 5561.90 SPEAKER_01  So, yeah.
5561.90 5571.90 SPEAKER_02  Well, so I, I would say like, okay, Virginia and North Carolina are going to be the ones that are going to go for it because they have pretty durable, uh, pro rail majorities.
5571.90 5588.90 SPEAKER_02  Um, you know, North Carolina essentially threw so much shit at the wall that if they get all the funding they want, that place is going to be like Switzerland, you know, in terms of passenger rail, California, uh, nothing's happening there.
5588.90 5589.90 SPEAKER_02  Right.
5589.90 5594.90 SPEAKER_02  Um, you know, uh, the, the Washington, Oregon, uh, who knows?
5594.90 5602.90 SPEAKER_02  Um, but yeah, this is going to be, I don't know, maybe we can do a deeper dive at some point in the future, but I could see a lot of stuff just not happening.
5602.90 5605.90 SPEAKER_02  Um, you know, extremely depressing.
5605.90 5607.90 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
5607.90 5614.90 SPEAKER_02  Several like, you know, dozens of billions of dollars that just don't go anywhere or do anything for like, at least four years.
5614.90 5615.90 SPEAKER_02  Ugh.
5615.90 5619.90 SPEAKER_01  It's just the other thing is that all these proposals were so like tepid to start with.
5619.90 5620.90 SPEAKER_01  Yes.
5620.90 5624.90 SPEAKER_01  Like it's not, this is like the minimum that's then just not going to materialize.
5624.90 5626.90 SPEAKER_01  It's, it's extremely aggravating.
5626.90 5637.82 SPEAKER_02  It's amazing how long it's taken for like to get someone to fund a train from like, train from like cleveland columbus cincinnati you know which is the most obvious three cities
5637.82 5656.30 SPEAKER_01  in the entire country yeah yep but uh yeah yeah i remember asking the question when when when trump had gone i remember asking the question what happens to all this and well get your get your rubbers out and start rubbing off those the lines off this map i was about to say i mean at
5656.30 5678.74 SPEAKER_02  least mtrak's been pretty good about trying to award as many contracts as possible before an inauguration day right now trying to rush everything through because we also have to talk about our new fra director this fucking guy i i like the very low resolution picture that that
5678.74 5683.96 SPEAKER_01  yeah me too it's no distinctly diane abbott shade vibe going on here with the little rest it's very
5683.96 5715.84 SPEAKER_02  nice god bless that woman i am proud to announce that highly respected david fink a fifth generation railroader capital r will be the next administer of the federal railroad administration wrote donald john yeah david will bring his 45 plus years of transportation leadership success which will deliver the fra into a new era of safety and technological innovation under david's guidance the federal railroad administration will be great again congratulations to david uh-huh make
5715.84 5725.98 SPEAKER_04  make railroad great again thank you mr president david fink was the president of the pan am railroad
5725.98 5746.50 SPEAKER_02  oh god in new england why is it called the pan am railroad i think it's a very good question rose why is it called the pan am railroad because david fink's dad thought it'd be funny to buy the defunct uh trademarks of pan am and switch them with the railroad he owned and the airline he owned
5746.50 5752.74 SPEAKER_04  i mean that does sound kind of funny to be fair yeah that's kind of posting posting energy you know
5752.74 5764.64 SPEAKER_02  yeah and i do like the pan am branding so you know so there's now it used to be called guilford rail systems or something like that that is kind of kooky pan am railroad and guilford airlines i believe
5764.64 5831.32 SPEAKER_01  jesus christ i think that actually does work better to be fair okay that's actually based uh okay i'm reassessing i was going to whisper into the mic is this u.s handy but uh but i don't know maybe maybe it isn't uh because i actually i i'm all for that bit gareth you're the you're the railroad right of way expert here i am i don't like i know i see you've put two pictures of rights of way here and i i was deliberately actually three because there's some under the wagon above i was deliberately not paying attention to uh picture number two uh yeah you remember the episode where we did a morpeth where we talked about super elevation one thing that i didn't need to say in that episode because i felt strongly that i didn't need to say is you don't put super elevation on straight track um they they seem not to have in fairness the track is not exactly straight yeah that's also a fair point yeah they're just responding to the to the deficiency as they go through all these 50 pounds pieces in all directions yeah that's uh that's horrifying uh really do not
5831.32 5874.12 SPEAKER_02  like that that's a shambles the pan am railroad essentially took over a lot of uh tracks that pen central didn't want let's say in new england sure yeah um i mean you know that's a lot of about 1700 miles of track in new england in about this condition yep um you know a lot of times this track is like 10 miles an hour if you're lucky they're known for like bizarre derailments in winter like okay the track goes through a divot the divot becomes a pond um yeah the pond freezes over in the winter and then the train derails on skids on the ice what the hell that's just not a derailment
5874.12 5883.06 SPEAKER_01  mechanism that is simply is not a derailment mechanism that exists i refuse to believe it hey buddy you better believe it there's a big i see there's also tunnel collapse in one of the
5883.06 5901.92 SPEAKER_02  other photos here there's a big tunnel um in new england uh the hoosack tunnel is like four miles long it was an amazing engineering achievement uh came into pan am ownership um it collapsed what the tunnel like yeah not the ownership he let he let the hoosack tunnel collapse
5901.92 5911.12 SPEAKER_01  oh great yeah i would oh nope yeah yep you don't want to do that no this guy so this guy's like he's a
5911.12 5918.72 SPEAKER_04  he's a fifth generation railroader and a first generation tunnel collapse yeah yeah he's i i mean
5918.72 5944.38 SPEAKER_02  the the pan am has long been like you know at we talk about how bad that the class one railroads do maintenance um but when you get down into the class twos uh this was this is a whole other situation this is this is like how far can you push it oh boy seeming pretty far yeah so one of
5944.38 5980.54 SPEAKER_01  the things that got so here's a little peep behind the curtain one of the things that for the sake of making my book smaller and tighter one of the things that got chopped actually and i got to turn into an article was me going into some detail about how you fix in you know how you fix the u.s railroad system um and i'm gonna i'm gonna put up as a proper article and and so on so on but one of the key things was um take the railroad out of the hands of these guys yeah please yes but the problem is if you do that what you might end up doing is putting it back in the hands of this guy because he's now head of the fra yeah exactly so yeah yeah but he's wearing a different hat or at
5980.54 6026.98 SPEAKER_02  least a different time yes so this is uh this railroad uh some people have said okay but he kept freight rail a going concern in new england because that's that's been a very difficult thing if you call this freight rail yeah like isn't a rail supposed to be straight this is a good point yeah i mean but you know okay it's been very difficult to sustain freight operations in new england for probably 90 years now but on the other hand i'm not surprised the tracks looking like that for fuck's sake fix your shit man yeah it's it's it's not a good situation um this this railroad was it folded a couple years ago it was sold to csx who i believe have since reopened the
6026.98 6058.28 SPEAKER_01  who's act tunnel thank god good i mean if you're running a railroad at 10 miles an hour the thing that railways are good for is that they they're fast like you can run fast and get your goods reliably on time places yeah it makes no sense to have it would be like they would make more money by ripping this up laying the track completely fresh tracks along this right of way and then they would you know and then running this the trains quicker so they can move more goods it just makes no sense to
6058.28 6062.76 SPEAKER_02  have a railway looks like this not only can you not run it fast because the track's in so bad shape
6062.76 6076.28 SPEAKER_01  you can't even run a long train no you get nothing yeah just a well just a shambles anyway let's not dwell on this i'm sure this is actually fine he's competent no elon take this guy with you
6076.28 6092.16 SPEAKER_02  the american short line and regional railroad association is excited to have one of their guys at fra though so um oh god good for them mixed blessings that's a whole different level of small
6092.16 6099.82 SPEAKER_01  business tyrant when it's you know a small railroad so i'm sure the next bit of news will be good to
6099.82 6144.02 SPEAKER_02  happy uh railroad news finally no oh oh god oh dear so this is one that a lot of people like asked me to talk about um you know because this is such an insane incident that occurred i don't think it got a lot of press because there's just insane derailments that happen every single day that don't get a lot of press but this is one of the bigger ones um this is in pecos texas right um this oversized load truck stalled at a grade crossing that i believe it was not authorized to cross it had some kind of big oil refining equipment whatever this huge tube is here right yeah yeah we've done a few of these in the uk
6144.02 6151.08 SPEAKER_04  in the in the 60s 70s and installing the uh like special transport dlc for american trucks and and
6151.08 6258.40 SPEAKER_02  then yeah you know then this happens yeah this is like a distillation column or something like that um i heard from some of the earlier articles said eyewitnesses said it was stuck on the crossing for 45 minutes i think there was a subsequent report from the ntsb that said it was only there for one minute then all that was taken down i have no idea how long this truck was on the crossing but this huge fucking you know chemical reactor whatever the hell this thing is was stuck on this crossing up here right um and then rapidly all converted into scrap by yes this big uh union pacific i believe train came through this is full of domestic containers um so like 53 foot containers those trains go fast as opposed to the sea containers that go slow this was probably doing there's video uh up there on youtube if you want to watch a snuff film this was probably gone 60 or 70 miles an hour when it impacted um you can see several probably dozens of cars jackknifed here um the big chemical reactor impacted the pecos texas depot um took out probably two bays of windows um this was very very nasty uh also well i guess there's no hazmat so it's fine no reporting in the media uh killed the engineer and conductor um you know so this is very very ugly and this is something which is not too uncommon this happens every day basically yeah yeah but you know i all i can say is if you're in this situation there's a blue sign on the railroad crossing where you can call a phone number and speak to the dispatcher and they
6258.40 6273.02 SPEAKER_01  will stop the train from crashing into your truck but also don't unless unless you're a hundred percent confident your vehicle is getting across that level crossing don't enter the crossing yeah and this is uh
6273.02 6284.06 SPEAKER_02  this is very i don't know the video was insane to look at it was like yeah you know and the amount of damage that was done here like bizarre it's impressive how much it's compressed in actually
6284.06 6297.92 SPEAKER_01  because there's so much momentum behind this these mega trains particularly when they're going at those high speeds i'm impressed how localized the mess estate there's a hell of a lot of energy that's been dissipated i was about to say it was an engineer did you say the engineer died engineer died
6297.92 6310.88 SPEAKER_02  instantly conductor died a little bit later obviously awful yeah so uh don't kill people if your truck gets stuck on the crossing call the phone number on the little blue sign yeah um i mean
6310.88 6315.44 SPEAKER_04  i'm sure i'm sure if we looked we could find some structural causes but in this about the trucking
6315.44 6326.88 SPEAKER_02  industry right this is true this is true i mean this is probably one of those where it's like well we could save some time if we just go through downtown pecos as opposed to an authorized crossing like 50 miles away
6326.88 6335.16 SPEAKER_04  you know all the time to like train the driver to be like read blue sign call number on the blue sign
6335.16 6339.24 SPEAKER_02  yeah i think a lot of people don't know about the blue sign though you're probably right it's a thing
6339.24 6427.90 SPEAKER_01  that comes there's a thing that happens a lot in the uk more more than the u.s uh or certainly well bridge strikes happen in the u.s but the bridges are often bigger so that the trucks get smashed up and the railway doesn't care but in the uk we have quite a lot of bridge or gb we have a lot of bridge strikes where unfortunately because our bridges are often very spindly and our hdvs are our road trucks are oversized um and too heavy they they often you often have to close the railway to go and check that the railway is safe and fine and these happen so often and there are bridges that these happen that like there are bridges where people have set up webcams because it happens so often um and i know that the u.s has a few like that as well but certainly the uk we have several of those and it happens all the time and you get angry people boomer types going oh we should be prosecuting the drivers more and more you know we need to increase the penalties for drivers like that's not going to solve it drivers are overworked yes they are um you know they're working for their conditions are getting worse and worse as drivers they're overworked they are overstretched they the reality is that they the way you hit this is by taking the license away from the operator you take away from the haulage company um and doing that you know the drivers can move on because the drivers are very skilled and very in very short supply drivers can move on the company dies but the um yeah you have to it's training you know they're overworked they're not trained um they're often there isn't the back office support because with the haulage company it's not just the driver going freestyle like these routes have to be planned particularly for this thing which is a specialist object that route should have been planned
6427.90 6438.26 SPEAKER_02  meticulously and and hopefully coordinated with the railroad i mean on the video you can see there's multiple support vehicles and folks just sort of standing around like i don't know what to do
6439.02 6448.70 SPEAKER_01  um like this like that company should be out of that that's a company that should no longer exist you know that haulage company should be out of business i mean if you killed people you know you
6448.70 6452.32 SPEAKER_02  should probably be facing you know the management should be facing you know criminal charges exactly
6452.32 6466.80 SPEAKER_01  that's it it's not like i don't hold this against the the driver this is on the planners this is on the the the back of house staff but particularly the management because clearly there's not that there's a there's a failure here that's allowed this to happen but just really yeah all these are like
6466.80 6473.14 SPEAKER_02  fly-by-night haulers you know that's yeah exactly it's yeah well it's like whack-a-mole the challenge
6473.14 6488.58 SPEAKER_01  is if you know if one of these if you get into a situation where they're used to getting penalized to debt to kind of totality then then there's another one pops up with it with a slightly different name they just add the number two after the name of their company or whatever exactly yeah well don't let that
6488.58 6570.50 SPEAKER_02  hi it's justin uh so this is a commercial for the podcast that you're already listening to uh people are annoyed by these so let me get to the point we have this thing called patreon right the deal is you give us two bucks a month and we give you an extra episode once a month uh sometimes it's a little inconsistent but you know it's two bucks you get what you pay for um it also gets you our full back catalog of bonus episodes so you can learn about exciting topics like guns pickup trucks or pickup trucks with guns on them the money we raise through patreon goes to making sure that the only ad you hear on this podcast is this one anyway that's something to consider if you have two bucks to spare each month uh join at patreon.com forward slash wtyp pod do it if you want or don't it's your decision and we respect that back to the show but i do have one piece of positive news well just a tiny there we go hey how about congestion pricing we got it finally oh my god new york city has
6570.50 6585.64 SPEAKER_04  congestion pricing thank you are you telling me that like a a a good idea came to pass in government and had like immediate positive material effects yeah when was the last time that shit
6585.64 6633.64 SPEAKER_02  happened like weed legalization like only and only one man could make it happen governor cuomo governor cuomo yeah baby i told the cars to make cd for the people of new york in the open top 1930s like yeah yeah yeah this is actually yeah i i mean this was uh this genuinely was uh legislation that was passed under cuomo's administration which um was durable enough yeah 2019 that uh it was durable enough that even kathy hokal could not stop it
6633.64 6640.26 SPEAKER_04  five years of your life on like an obvious thing that is gonna make the city so much better
6640.26 6677.12 SPEAKER_02  well i think uh this is uh this actually started well before that when they were trying to make it happen um i didn't i didn't actually write when it started um i did say it took about 1.7 apollo programs of time um yeah yeah what a beautiful reflection of state capacity that is yeah that that is that is how i've started meant like thinking about like smart various small transit or you know transportation projects is okay how it's like uh repaving washington avenue here in philly that took one uh apollo
6677.12 6688.94 SPEAKER_01  program we we gotta start using that measurement for everything yeah yeah i like that that's i'm making that official it's very nice you start using that in the uk for things like hs2 so there was a lot of
6688.94 6709.70 SPEAKER_02  uh the the idea is okay below 60th street in manhattan you will with some exceptions uh be charged nine u.s dollars to enter the most congested area of the entire world in order to discourage you from doing self-harm like that
6709.70 6718.08 SPEAKER_04  it's just putting up a big sign that says hey why not consider taking public transport here considered
6718.08 6725.26 SPEAKER_02  public transportation take a bicycle walk i don't know how far how far a walk is it if you stood at
6725.26 6748.64 SPEAKER_01  the southern tip of uh of little manhattan right right down at the bottom bottom end um walked straight up uh northwards along the grid um uh i suppose skirt around the side of central park how long would it take you to to reach i don't know like harlem i how how long has it taken you to get up to i don't know what's what's what number of street so it's like a four-hour walk three
6748.64 6757.46 SPEAKER_04  yeah manhattan's like like like 13 miles long up and down so like but 60th is uh right at the south
6757.46 6761.82 SPEAKER_01  end of central park so how long does it do so from the tip to the south end of central park how long
6761.82 6768.50 SPEAKER_02  is that how long how long you started uh hold on i'm measuring this now uh the battery
6768.50 6790.64 SPEAKER_04  is seeing two guys here who who walked the whole length of broadway from 225th street in the bronx to battery park and it took them six hours 30 minutes at a leisurely pace a leisurely pace enjoying yourself yeah that sounds like a nice day just walk new york city that sounds great it's five miles
6790.64 6797.50 SPEAKER_02  along broadway from battery park to columbus circle yeah so you truly could be walking here you could be
6797.50 6814.42 SPEAKER_01  walking here that's actually a nice one of my favorite days in philly was when i just went for a walk and walked all the way around that's a very very long walk i did it was nice it's been a lot of time over in uh east philly um sorry in west philly there's no east philly forgive me
6814.42 6817.54 SPEAKER_03  in a dream i saw the city invincible it's just gareth yeah
6817.54 6829.38 SPEAKER_01  yeah just me out on my own in a little tent um so yeah that's a nice walk so my point being the the reason i asked that question is because uh new york very dense uh manhattan very dense um
6829.38 6881.70 SPEAKER_02  super walkable right yes it's uh it's got the most public transportation probably anywhere in the united states at least possibly i mean just from the density of the subway maybe almost anywhere in the world um you know and and so this has been opposed by a lot of disparate groups most notably the state of new jersey fuck um fuck those guys that's fine because uh the governor has uh the governor of new jersey has uh made the argument this is going to increase pollution in new jersey um because of take the train question mark take the train dickhead um well you know the the idea of this this congestion tax is that we are going to or congestion toll it's a tax i don't know what it is you pay the government money we call it a
6881.70 6888.62 SPEAKER_04  congestion charge yeah yeah that's as good a term as any i guess all of this money goes straight to
6888.62 6992.90 SPEAKER_02  public transportation good perfect um yes exactly so um you know uh this was opposed in new jersey because you know you're double told i guess if you go through you know the holland tunnel or the lincoln tunnel which is something you shouldn't do nope um uh the uh the because new jersey has what you call the get out of new jersey tax you don't pay to get in but you pay to get out baby you pay to leave new jersey you don't pay to enter but you pay to leave like hell um as uh as senator sumner said shortly before the civil war new jersey is the valley of humiliation through which all travelers north and south from the city of new york to the city of washington must pass and the monopoly like apollyon claims them all as subjects saying for all that country is mine and i am the prince and god of it um so they're finally like that's yeah that's poetic man i like that looks they're finally getting a taste of their own medicine um this is it but this was uh this was delayed significantly because governor hochel thought that she could uh increase the odds of democrats winning elections she fucked it um in new york if she delayed this tax which was uh presumed to be unpopular or this toll excuse me um and uh well that didn't work um new jersey sued to stop it from happening that has so far not worked they failed to get an injunction murphy but yeah the tolls are the tolls are being levied um but we lost six months of revenue also the toll was reduced from
6992.90 7003.46 SPEAKER_01  sixteen dollars to nine dollars it's like a sizable reduction in revenue like a massive reduction in revenue yes and i mean at least it's happening yeah exactly at least it's happening i mean it's
7003.46 7030.76 SPEAKER_02  you're still going to have problems with the mta budget um but it is happening and it has sort of worked better than maybe people expected because um you know it's only been a few days now but um travel times in lower manhattan if you're driving are like the streets are free and open everywhere oh wow nice uh they're probably going to have to start readjusting bus schedules because they're
7030.76 7043.48 SPEAKER_01  all arriving early yes it works the thing works this works london made it work it works i wrote peace and jacobin about this it works all the evidence is there it works huckle is an idiot i'm glad that
7043.48 7099.38 SPEAKER_02  she's had to eat shit and this has happened definitely ate shit yeah on this one you know she's now known for being opposed to this fairly obvious thing um but people are still like trying to figure out ways to get mad about this i mean this is sort of you know the world's most obvious policy you know i guess you could say it's neoliberal but guess what we live in neoliberalism and this is like a good policy that works okay it may be there's like one guy who lives in a rent control department in lenox hill who is poor but not poor enough to qualify for an exemption you know what fuck him too is is disabled but apparently not disabled enough to qualify for the exemption who may get fucked over by this but yeah my my understanding is that they they found like this is almost this is affected almost no one negatively found the one the one guy that it
7099.38 7119.22 SPEAKER_04  affected negatively who's also the least sympathetic possible guy for this or it's it's it's like a guy who i like an insanely rich guy who lives in an insanely rich place who cannot leave his block without getting charged something by someone now which is really funny it was uh it was uh this guy was
7119.22 7180.52 SPEAKER_02  like uh um interviewed on like freedom eagle dot biz news or something like that and uh you know he was like well i can't go visit my kids up on 79th street because i i park on 61st street indicating that he probably has a parking spot that he paid you know a tremendous amount of mother more more than the entire uh town of like shelby montana is worth for the one parking spot um and uh you know he's like well i can't drive north without i can't drive at all without going through the congestion zone because okay fifth avenue is uh one way southbound and it's like sure but dude take the subway you don't you don't you don't know what nine dollars is take the subway nine dollars is literally like you've never had you you aren't aware of sums of money that small like is that that's where the court is funny that
7180.52 7187.36 SPEAKER_04  the the guy with a really like uniquely fucked real estate situation is a real estate developer
7187.36 7239.48 SPEAKER_02  yeah well that's where the cordon is it's through a part of the island where everyone's absurdly wealthy so anyone who is stuck in that situation again uh get over it boys yeah it's like nine dollars is what they think a banana costs um but yeah it's very good for them maybe it should finally see some good policy happening it's good to see congestion pricing i mean this is going to fund a bunch of ada improvements on the subway this is going to fund theoretically the second avenue subway extension to 125th street um this is going to find well those are the two i know about i don't know about the rest of it um you know but that this this unlocks a lot of bonding capacity for the mta uh it's good it's a good thing uh everyone who's mad at it is dumb and suck shit and i don't care
7239.48 7279.20 SPEAKER_04  about them yeah exactly yep listen sometimes you've just gotta like hit the big state go do thing button and yes damn the consequences win world war ii yes i agree andrew highbring you can suck the shit out of liam's ass yeah exactly it's the bit in ford versus ferrari where where henry ford the second or third or whatever the fuck is like uh we used to build planes in this building uh therefore fuck italy it's kind of like that you know yeah great movie by the way yeah yeah noted i'm summarizing it very poorly but i i cite instead my letterbox review which is i think four stars and just the word vroom very good
7279.20 7296.58 SPEAKER_01  uh i need a few more goodreads reviews like that of my book actually people just just just does the words the word trend with an e and a five star review on goodreads that'd be nice if anyone wants to make that happen then go for it yeah please yeah all right we've done the good news let's go
7296.58 7354.58 SPEAKER_04  back to bad news we're all gonna die we're all going to die how about that bird flow that's good i oh i'm not thinking about how thinking about like the prospect of doing a lockdown again and how how that would go um how trump has to do another lockdown oh god well the thing is right what lockdown did right it saved a lot of lives it got a lot of people into into podcasts and so therefore i assume right they do lockdown lockdown number whatever um for for bird flu um not only do we uh like all go completely insane but we also make infinity money like you know we could make a lot of money um and go insane which is usually a good combination like yeah that that kind of overlap of things rarely happens outside of like cult compounds but i i think we have the possibility to yeah yeah yeah
7354.58 7358.26 SPEAKER_01  maybe like the spanish economic miracle but just for podcasters it'd be amazing
7358.26 7367.32 SPEAKER_04  yeah people people thought podcasts were washed but then one turkey started coughing into its beak
7367.32 7392.00 SPEAKER_01  and and you know from then you know um i mean i don't i don't know if i'm ready for another global pandemic i i had covid again over uh before christmas in fact when i was in the height of the fever when we recorded the fireworks episode i i wasn't joking about my 100 degree fever i was burning up what's funny is i my fever broke mid-episode so like you might have noticed i took my hat off and beads of sweat poured out it's because my fever broke mid-episode while we were recording which
7392.00 7396.18 SPEAKER_04  is quite fun so i actually had an all right night's sleep i've i've i've been masking and i still feel
7396.18 7421.08 SPEAKER_01  like i've been sick like pretty much all the time so but it was it was covid because i i'd lost my sense of smell and taste and i haven't come back properly yet so like i don't want to get out and what's great is that i can't find any information the nhs website hasn't been updated with the latest covid symptoms and the latest um strain for like two years or something now so yeah it's really great that we've just decided that's done and now bird flu's on its way over so yeah like i i
7421.08 7501.44 SPEAKER_04  don't i i you know me i've never been one of these people who's like hyperbolic about it but we really did just like give up it seems like yeah yeah i mean like the other thing is i don't want to reassure anybody because like i don't want to say like oh you know the the healthcare system's better prepared for like zoonotic flu than it was no it is better prepared for than it was for covid because covid was really like de novo whereas like flu is something that like they've kind of like yeah exercise sickness the thing that we got nightingale hospitals from was specifically like basically h5n1 uh there's a ton of like planning around it but the thing is when covid was a thing first in like 2020 i did a what was pretty well reasoned at the time i thought thread where i was like listen there's very little chance that it's not contained in place and then there's still less chance that it spreads you know like regionally and then internationally um and like you know ultimately if you if it gets to a point where you have to panic you'll know but don't panic and at the time i was right it's just that i was then subsequently more owned by events than i have ever been so i don't want to be like don't panic now you know yeah i told liam when the uh when the
7501.44 7506.04 SPEAKER_02  lockdown happened and we were not let into local paths because the lockdown happened i was like this
7506.04 7526.52 SPEAKER_04  is going to last two years minimum yeah how many apollo programs is that uh that is one we did an apollo program for giving everybody a respiratory disease that's uh that's one fifth of an apollo program we we choose to give everybody covid and to do the other things not because they are easy but because
7526.52 7555.88 SPEAKER_02  they are hard so the bird flu the bird flu this h5n1 this is interesting to see yeah you guys heard of this h5n1 this has been interesting to see progress because it's been around for ages it's been around for ages but it's okay it started spreading from birds to cows right and then it spread to agricultural workers but also those people are blameless it also spread to raw milk guys
7555.88 7580.06 SPEAKER_04  those people should be can't say that on youtube quarantined like all the stuff that they thought that lockdown was should be happening to them the who should be hunting them down with dark guns yeah exactly bb2 it bluey pasture didn't die for this i agree all the scary like you know like uh disease thrillers where the government comes in and kicks your door down with the hazmat suits on
7580.06 7585.10 SPEAKER_02  they should be doing that to you if you drink raw milk yeah it's like come on come on come on
7585.10 7621.88 SPEAKER_01  it's just boiling it it's fine the only time you can ever drink raw milk is immediately after it's come out of the cow any time after that do not do that i've drunk back i'm not a raw milk guy good grief good grief no uh i have farming family and i know what that looks like don't do that but um drinking it straight fresh out of the vat once it's come out the cow is very nice um a rare treat but uh storing it in the whole point is that as soon as it's more than five minutes after that it's full of all manner of excitement uh not good for all kinds of stuff because it's like warm and
7621.88 7634.10 SPEAKER_02  fatty and it's like yeah yeah yeah like i mean you know i have to buy like insane chemicals to clean dairy equipment because it's also grody instantly it's instantly fatty and full of nonsense yeah
7634.10 7685.48 SPEAKER_04  exactly so don't do that the main thing here and and this is this is something that we're never gonna do and it's a lot like the car thing right uh except instead of what we consider to be a higher form of life it's what we consider to be a lower form of life right is that okay pandemics like zoonotic pandemics are not the main reason to do it the main reason to do it is climate sustainability but like we need to start like rapidly rethinking our relationship with animals as food um like the the the like poultry industry the meat industry uh in i mean uh the developed world at a minimum right is just like not sustainable it's not compatible with uh kind of like non-disastrous continued existence right like and i'm i'm not gonna tell you that you have to go vegan overnight
7685.48 7692.06 SPEAKER_02  right but like uh unfortunately you're gonna have to eat the bugs here's some shrimp here's some
7692.06 7738.46 SPEAKER_01  croft fish yeah you might you might have to delicious lobster roll here's most of us don't even have to reduce our meat intake at all like the amount of wastage the amount of mass meat that gets consumed by people who just eat don't even like most of us could still have like a nice meaty meal a couple of times a week and and the and it's the mass it's the cheap mass meat manufacturer that is just the amount of land carbon and then as you say very squeezed in close proximity no quality of life animals that we go through and also rapid fire generations which are just fat as you say fantastic for zoonotic diseases to just oh yeah so um yeah no absolutely very good reason for us to completely
7738.46 7761.48 SPEAKER_02  reevaluate that yeah it's also like we're just reducing your meat consumption i mean you know you can make a uh a bad bad i i i know some people are like i want to eat a one pound steak and it's like i don't understand that you can have like a a pasta and you know has like i don't know half a pound of pancetta in it it feeds four people i mean yeah it's it's a lot it's a lot healthier you tend to like
7761.48 7806.10 SPEAKER_04  feel a lot better i just it's it's one of the things that like i think about it the same way i think about the cars getting crushed by the the like fire department bulldozer right in that i think this is one of those decisions that you can make now or that is going to get made for you by circumstance in in the like near future right um like ultimately we we have we have lived through the golden age of eating meat right like the kind of ready availability of that as a protein um unless we like really go like the only way out is through and lab grow the fuck out of things i think i don't think any of that's gonna that's not gonna turn out very well yeah well then in that case i think any conceivable future is one where people eat a lot less meat and that's probably for for the best you know but it's uh
7806.10 7838.58 SPEAKER_02  it's been interesting to see like uh the sort of lack of response to uh bird flu contaminating all of these you know dairy uh cattle um you know because it's like okay we're not we're not quarantining agricultural workers the government is not you know ordering these uh these herds uh destroyed they're also not paying for quarantining those herds it's sort of like there's been a total paralysis in terms of containing you know h5n1 um we've had a few severe cases where is it spread sorry i'm
7838.58 7843.88 SPEAKER_01  actually not up to date with where it spread is is it in california or is it where it's it's in oh god
7843.88 7896.54 SPEAKER_02  i want to say that it's it's in the midwest it's in the south it's in the west um it's i don't think it's made it out east yet uh yeah but this is this has been kind of you know there's only a few human cases like well there's been like 60 human cases or something like that um there's been no human to human transmission we have had situations where like i think there was one like big cat sanctuary that like the all the big cats were wiped out by bird flu somehow um you know there's uh the the the bird flu is obviously affecting birds including wild birds um yeah this is uh you know i i guess the real question is uh with our pretty meager attempts to uh contain this can we uh i don't know tough it out until the summer when presumably transmission is down i have no idea how bird flu
7896.54 7937.06 SPEAKER_04  is transmitted so so so so the thing is that as as far as we know the thing that has not happened yet that would be the scary thing would be like human to human transmission um yeah and so you get cases where people like catch it from animals and then uh get sick and i think like like three people have died total um which is a pretty high case fatality rate but you know um and yeah i i i don't like betting against the cdc right even in uh like two weeks time when they're you know the new director is uh someone that trump saw on tv turbo hitler yeah yeah yeah i would have to i'd have to uh i'd have
7937.06 7949.78 SPEAKER_02  to really lock myself in my apartment to even a greater extent than during covet because i don't want to i don't want to like give it to milk i'd miss you yeah yeah no i don't want milkshake to die
7949.78 7971.64 SPEAKER_04  yeah me either you don't you don't you don't want to fuck around with this one but like i say i i think the public health and surveillance system that exists around uh flu like this is as good as there is for anything um and you know like i say i really don't i really really don't want to reassure people
7971.64 7979.16 SPEAKER_02  again because yeah no we're around that business don't uh don't don't touch don't touch the anti-lathe
7979.16 7996.06 SPEAKER_04  no it's the official w2ip position is do panic yes yeah panic uh lose your shit like move out into the country uh kill all birds on site yeah do not allow any animal protein reservoir to become close
7996.06 8008.82 SPEAKER_02  to you yeah um yeah oh dear panic freak out become become vegan but also psychotic against all living
8008.82 8027.46 SPEAKER_00  animals uh like or like crippling contamination anxiety a little economy a little combi um i actually
8027.46 8052.54 SPEAKER_04  i actually kill every animal i see and refuse to eat them i mean it's it's fun because um my wife is basically vegan which means i'm basically vegan these days sure and it's crazy how much i don't miss it like in general like uh the the fucking impossible burgers or whatever the fuck they're fine that it's the same like i have no cheese yet that's the only thing i was gonna say me i don't
8052.54 8056.86 SPEAKER_01  think it's cheese and i think i'd miss tremendously actually cheese would be the problem for me
8056.86 8074.14 SPEAKER_04  because vegan cheese sucks the thing about vegan cheese that worked that one out yet vegan cheese no one tells you this but vegan cheese stinks like especially if you like if it's been in the fridge for like a day vegan cheese will like it's like a chemical fucking web uh but yeah
8074.14 8084.66 SPEAKER_01  yeah so okay we've had pand we are playing crashes we've had uh derailments we've had pandemics surely this is we're not going to escalate from here there's nothing worse than this right my head
8084.66 8090.48 SPEAKER_04  what i'm trying to go to sleep yeah yeah yeah yeah it's like anxiety nightmare all right folks
8090.48 8094.32 SPEAKER_02  oh no it's the gulf of america yes
8094.32 8117.28 SPEAKER_04  oh no oh oh oh oh oh oh man fest destiny everywhere this is i mean again you want to talk about the age of incoherence you want to talk about crash outs it fuck elon musk donald trump going on tv and being like you know what maybe we gotta invade panama canada and denma well and greenland
8117.28 8123.58 SPEAKER_02  greenland yeah and we're gonna rename it from the gulf of mexico to the gulf of america
8123.58 8139.60 SPEAKER_04  the u.s might have enough clout to have that stick like he's he can't like change it internationally but he can order like federal agencies to use it and to be honest if it definitely like put it in public schools yeah yeah like that's probably enough to get it changed on a lot of the maps
8139.60 8164.06 SPEAKER_01  so i'm thinking of a great follow on twitter pinstripe bugle i'm just thinking of like the mass of like the america like the u.s civil service just like like like unhappily having to go through all their atlases and saying oh well i'm not happy i'm doing the unhappy face while i change all these cross score out in mexico and all these maps to america i just uh i picked up a globe off the street
8164.06 8185.96 SPEAKER_02  a couple days ago it's it's crazy you know i don't know i don't know if you you've ever done this you picked up a globe off the street it's in my living room now i never picked and i was really excited because it is an old globe it's still had the soviet union oh yeah yeah hell yeah it spells korea it also had some it said zimbabwe but brackets rhodesia
8185.96 8197.38 SPEAKER_01  no but zimbabwe now so that's gonna be like oh okay like the xkcd diagram of uh how you date things that's that's that's that's the one that's my go-to but i know that now there's gonna be some
8197.38 8203.26 SPEAKER_02  uh you know gen z kid you know 10 years from now who's also gonna pick up a street globe and he's gonna
8203.26 8223.34 SPEAKER_04  be like wow this one says gulf of mexico on it this is literally why right like it's crazy how much this is just straight up trump thinking about his legacy right until until h5n1 has him go out like stan chera again like him just being like before i die of bird flu i've got him he's gonna get he's
8223.34 8231.30 SPEAKER_02  gonna get bird flu and transform into a bald eagle and fly into the sunset yeah yeah experts now believe
8231.30 8293.52 SPEAKER_04  this donald trump is more of a mythological figure um but yeah no he so clearly wants to change the map as like a way of securing his personal legacy yep and the ways he can think of of doing that are like territorial expansion that the u.s last tried in like the 1830s and yes it should be called the gulf of america and the thing is right i've i've said this you could placate the guy you could fulfill that need by either putting him on mount rushmore which i bet south dakota would go for or renaming florida the state of trump and the thing is i think floridians would go for that about three to one you could fucking do it i don't care it would ultra cuck desantis into like a level of never seen yeah florida i think the u.s should be reminded of trump in aeternum for sure i think it deserves a state of trump i think it should have his face on the flag like washington state and i i it will continue to be the worst place on earth i was gonna say with the uh the proposed
8293.52 8314.76 SPEAKER_02  uh annexation of panama or re-annexation of panama i should say um and annexing canada and so on and so forth you know i think uh you know a lot of these people maybe maybe start sending out some feelers to china like you guys interested in a foreign military base uh yeah like driving me into the arms of china
8314.76 8319.94 SPEAKER_04  to be like yeah you know sorry do you want to station a couple of like marine regiments in greenland
8319.94 8327.08 SPEAKER_02  you thinking about like uh you know like a little you know marine base i we could probably do that for
8327.08 8333.42 SPEAKER_04  you yeah we're the president politically i'm guessing my people in nuke yearn for freedom
8333.42 8342.02 SPEAKER_01  please send j20 strike fighters well politically whereas pat is pan in my head panama is a bit of a
8342.02 8369.16 SPEAKER_02  sock puppet for the u.s because of the yeah yeah panama is a fake country we invented to build the canal yes but then we gave them a lot more independence and we gave them back to jimmy carter gave them back the canal which a lot of people were very mad about at the time and uh trump is apparently still mad about it apparently but also if we retake they could definitely go to china yeah if we retake the canal guess what we get the expanded locks at no charge other than the military
8369.16 8390.22 SPEAKER_01  intervention which will probably be they're going to be dry i'm sorry to break it up money not your money right it's it's a thing that um a lot of people don't realize about how much global trade is going to get turned upside down the next 30 years but um it's unlikely the panama canal will be functioning much after the middle of this century like the u.s has already been handed the
8390.22 8394.16 SPEAKER_04  fucking northwest like uh the northwest passage so this is true
8394.16 8418.68 SPEAKER_02  you gotta you gotta you gotta get canada for that one he's like we're gonna use tariffs and economic pressure um now i think alberta and saskatchewan would probably join the united states no problem uh but i don't know about like ontario i mean i am excited to see if we annex canada and like american politics has to deal with bloc quebecois because it'd be really funny to see like
8418.68 8434.32 SPEAKER_04  block establish a foothold in louisiana um really really enjoying the idea that like making canada state and you immediately get uh you know another 50 electoral college votes that all go to democrats
8434.32 8440.62 SPEAKER_02  like uh albers just gets completely shut out new hampshire new hampshire is lost to bloc
8440.62 8503.24 SPEAKER_04  quebecois as well um but because it's because trump read infinite jest and he's trying to do the great concavity either that or he played fallout one um i don't know which is scary um i mean like any one of these is like so obviously fucked i i i i don't know i i i thought maybe in my lifetime we would see the end of the united states with its borders as it has them and constitutional system as it has it i wasn't expecting it to be this stupid maybe i should have you know you should have maybe maybe this will because like i remember when like when i was a kid the kind of like prevailing lib dream was some kind of like uh eu analog like north american union right um imagine two two senators from greenland yeah i'll tell you that at this point i'm surprised trump hasn't tried to like buy baja california from mexico like in bardo like it just it would make more sense i would think it does none of it makes
8503.24 8509.16 SPEAKER_02  any sense but it looks like claudia's about to do the big big shitty infrastructure investment over
8509.16 8542.72 SPEAKER_04  there so you know give it to us claudia we can be trusted possible time for the u.s to seize control right now free railroads yes oh god i just don't just visualize it i'm just being in the canadian military right now and having to earnestly be like to justin trudeau who was resigning in like a week's time just in case yeah we do have the backup plans for the like stay behind gorilla yeah yeah that we would have to run in case he's actually serious canadian gladio is gonna be a
8542.72 8549.00 SPEAKER_02  hell of a thing yeah they're gonna gonna gonna start poisoning timeline gonna gonna open uh the maple
8549.00 8569.94 SPEAKER_01  syrup floodgates i'm just enjoying the idea of a bunch of quebecois french speakers um uh flipping the coin on trump and invading uh yeah like going invading down into new hampshire and you have uh so you've got a bunch of quebecois guys like taking over berlin ah we said we would get it no we are finally marching through berlin ah
8569.94 8582.70 SPEAKER_02  yeah that's it i look forward to that moment maybe canada canada just seizes the gray lakes you know like preemptively in a preempt you know preemptive invasion i you know i think uh you know some of
8582.70 8595.32 SPEAKER_04  those cities would go with it you know this is this is what happens when you hang out with baron your only map game playing kid take that guy's steam license away
8595.32 8605.44 SPEAKER_01  yeah he's been he's uh he's been all playing tno as well it's like weird they're really yeah they're really fucked up heart like they're really fucked up only fascist uh
8605.44 8618.06 SPEAKER_04  mods on i could see baron as a millennium dawn guy i'll be honest i think that's what i think that's what led into this you know i think that's how how this is happening you know it's an it's an oops
8618.06 8621.92 SPEAKER_01  news episode and we've hit the two and a half hour mark my god there's been a lot of news there's been
8621.92 8645.06 SPEAKER_04  a lot of news it has it's true i i do like the the knights of the golden circle flag on the thing by the way this is i i can explain this so this was this was an idea that was sort of in vogue uh pre-civil um where the u.s was gonna like seize and colonize uh like a kind of south and central yeah all of
8645.06 8649.44 SPEAKER_03  central america and also the caribbean for some reason yeah well it was it was gonna be like a
8649.44 8743.72 SPEAKER_04  as a hedge against the civil war right the south was going to create this country the the the golden circle that was gonna be like all slavery um and yeah it's like you want to talk about like hearts of iron mods this was this was burgundy this was like the order and start burgundy but in like 1850 um and yeah thankfully this did not come off uh but like people were still pitching this even after the war people were pitching to ulysses s grant of like shit like hey maybe the u.s should like try and grant statehood to i mean cuban statehood was a thing that was proposed a number of times uh but like you know uh bits of uh the northern coast of south america i think that was even a push for like uh like brazilian statehood at one point which was you know not something the brazilians were interested in so yeah no it's it just kind of bafflingly weird geopolitical intrusions the u.s is like benefited a great deal from its its geography and from the kind of like map game starting position that it's ended up with of like having no one who's really credibly able to invade us anymore but that also means that they're stuck in this position where it's like if you are of that mindset you want to paint some more like color on the map your places to go are basically just like canada the caribbean or or or south to mexico and south america like i was talking about the the knights of the golden circle yeah that's a real goofy one that that that's where we're that's
8743.72 8757.06 SPEAKER_01  where we're heading i mean if it keeps if it keeps trump entertained then you know uh i and you know the mexicans will keep him busy so you know it's fine just like just tell him they did it he'll he'll
8757.06 8774.62 SPEAKER_02  believe it probably that yeah that is the that is the part that i'm worried about is invading mexico i feel like they might just actually do that part and that sounds really bad considering the amount of progress that's happened in that country recently um attempting to kill friends of ours notwithstanding
8774.62 8792.82 SPEAKER_04  um yeah i don't think they deserve another punitive expedition for it you know yeah yeah exactly but and then and then like uh you know a hundred years later you get a bunch of like really cool revisionist westerns about it sure oh yeah that's yeah sure yeah no i think they should i think the u.s should go
8792.82 8806.96 SPEAKER_01  north i think canada could could do with canada has a reckoning coming on like all the trump guys in canada uh as well so maybe aim northwards let's see what happens i want to see the timeline from
8806.96 8821.96 SPEAKER_04  escape from la where the shining path unify all the oppressed peoples of the world against the u.s and florida is invaded by a joint cuban ugandan marine force i'd watch that oh i'd be pretty good
8821.96 8835.10 SPEAKER_02  that'd be pretty good i'd love to see that um yeah i mean you know the one thing about invading canada uh cold you know m track has priority over freight trains and via rail does not so
8835.10 8842.30 SPEAKER_04  via rail how many divisions do they have yeah exactly so uh so you would you would wind up
8842.30 8847.06 SPEAKER_02  improving passenger rail in the former country of canada um
8847.06 8883.36 SPEAKER_04  i mean listen we have precedent for what happens when a superpower tries to invade a uh like much smaller neighbor uh just on the basis of like well they're not really a country anyway and will probably be greeted as liberators and the answer is that your three-day special military operation is like bogged down for multiple years as that country is like turns itself into the most armed sort of like rump state imaginable a huge personal cost to everyone what i'm hearing is that all of
8883.36 8895.86 SPEAKER_02  the uh ukrainian canadian fascists oh boy they're gonna have the most unexpected convergence of interests ever they're gonna have to start taking arms from russia yeah
8895.86 8913.06 SPEAKER_04  no no you don't understand canada is american ukraine that's how you pitch it to them you know i worked yeah the languages are mostly mutually intelligible but there's a series of revealing grammatical mistakes you can make
8913.06 8929.44 SPEAKER_01  if trudeau's gonna do and have any sense behind him he needs to be folding up the huthies quickly if he wants to know how to circumvent and destroy u.s heart uh military hardware then there's no one better there's no one doing it better right now maybe maybe the maybe the like
8929.44 8933.30 SPEAKER_04  iranian drones are just trudeau hedging his bets just in case trump's serious
8933.30 8956.40 SPEAKER_02  damn damn no no this is this has gone poorly i support this idea now this is not where we're supposed to be okay um anyway uh arnold i think this is our last piece of dues hell yeah the sixers arena is coming to a center city near you
8956.40 8966.00 SPEAKER_01  huh yep oh okay zooms in on philly where's it going so so they the okay where yes thank yes
8966.00 9016.66 SPEAKER_02  where yeah so the uh the philadelphia 76ers the uh basketball team has been wanting to move their arena into center city for a while now and um oh i feel under qualified to do a huge exposition here uh but it's uh it's been very very unpopular with um a lot of grassroots activists has been very very unpopular with uh parts of chinatown because you know it's seen as this big uh big project that's going to you know gentrify neighborhoods it's going to it's replacing part of a dead mall in center city which admittedly is good they're building it right on top of a train station and also blocking off all the light into it which i think is bad um there's a lot of uh uh stuff not replacing the skylight you
9016.66 9027.78 SPEAKER_01  just see them dribbling the basketball on top of it yeah exactly exactly um where's it go where's where's it going exactly well i'm i'm whizzing about where where's it been dumped so it goes
9027.78 9034.62 SPEAKER_03  it goes yeah something like what is it they're gonna knock down the the uh the fashion district
9034.62 9083.70 SPEAKER_02  to build it right yeah so it's between market and filbert and 11th and 10th um as well as the bus terminal just north of that um which was previously sold off by private equity although you know i think they did take advantage of the fact that this uh this thing was uh going forward i mean this has been this has been a very contentious issue for a while it seems like uh mayor sherelle parker was sort of elected to do this deal right um it's been sort of steamrolled through for like a year now um and it's it's i i i'm not as like radical as some people and saying this is going to destroy you know chinatown that's going to destroy center city i think it's a bad idea and we don't get much out of it um obviously this is at the final vote you can see here someone being arrested for
9083.70 9097.82 SPEAKER_04  protesting uh it's getting i gotta say this is a great photo this is one of the best being like like sort of like huckled out of the location of all times you know i i was uh i was actually in the
9097.82 9117.24 SPEAKER_02  building when this happened but i was a jury there's a huge line of people at outside the building like waiting to get into the the the council hearing i was like oh damn a lot of people have jury duty today i was like no no they said no go to the front of the line you're allowed in
9117.24 9122.96 SPEAKER_01  thank you so you're losing a primark you're losing a gamestop you're losing a wetzels
9122.96 9157.86 SPEAKER_02  wetzels pretzels what's it there's uh the amc theater there's uh yeah yeah i mean so like the building it's replacing is not like especially great i mean the the the sort of um whatchamacallit they call it the fashion district now it used to be called the gallery um but this whole like uh process where they you know it's at some point it was like the sixers are going to move to center city um you know there was not much community input there was not much uh you know they've called it
9157.86 9166.82 SPEAKER_04  something at something 76 place market east yeah yeah i hate that exactly i mean the part i don't
9166.82 9216.16 SPEAKER_02  like is that they're going to ruin the train station yeah but you know the the the big thing here is i a lot of people have been protesting this for a lot of reasons and and then just didn't they just rammed it never felt like there's been any sort of engagement with anyone right about the stadium uh i guess people had no of course not yeah i don't i don't feel like it's necessarily like again i don't think it's the end of the world but i the way the way it's been pushed through it's been crazy yeah um the one the a couple they have like a community benefits agreement which is kind of mediocre there was a plan to put a bunch of affordable housing on the site uh but that got that got canceled because uh people don't like affordable housing i guess that oh man this was a
9216.16 9241.20 SPEAKER_04  little bit bizarre to me yeah so yeah like uh so they the the save china sound coalition did a poll which showed 56 against 18 in favor um but then when participants were given neutral information about why people support and oppose the arena it went to 69 against so you you try and pitch this to
9241.20 9285.78 SPEAKER_02  people and they like it less which is a really good sign that's how i feel yeah i i am i it's it's it's weird i mean you know or track the the only thing i could say is like look at similar like uh arena situations like in washington dc um where they did put you know a multi-purpose arena in the middle of their chinatown and uh well there's no chinatown anymore um yeah absolutely it's multi-purpose arena yeah exactly it's sort of uh increased rents you know it's sort of it's it's oh god i i should have put more notes here but yeah this is uh i it it it feels like there's a whole massive space that i
9285.78 9297.52 SPEAKER_01  happen to know is free down and uh right down uh where there happens to used to be a massive refinery complex and why the fuck don't they put it down there it already is down there that's the thing
9297.52 9349.06 SPEAKER_04  yeah i i have an idea leave it down there i have a modest proposal could you fit an nba standard sized basketball court on the ss united states yes oh that thing's never gonna move so they may as well refurbish it put move move the 76ers onto it uh you know fine honestly that that might be the solution yeah this is the kind of like lateral thinking you know that this is it city hall needs to hire me you know ss united states conservancy dm us listen listen stranger ideas have come to fruition right and if the u.s is gonna fucking invade greenland you tell me why the hell you can't play basketball on the largest ocean liner built in the u.s and the
9349.06 9364.76 SPEAKER_02  fastest across the atlantic ocean sure yeah i again it's not gonna move i mean it might move no it's probably not gonna move no that that's gonna be gareth you mentioned you were disappointed about not being able to see it well there's probably still time there's still time there's still time yeah
9364.76 9379.34 SPEAKER_01  i'm glad there's still time uh yeah exactly yeah i'll be making making a point of uh of whizzing over yeah that's it that that and the dead fleet there's a couple of things are on my list actually there's a lot of stuff on that on the on the the delaware that i want to see actually it's it's just a
9379.34 9398.40 SPEAKER_02  nice walk down yeah anyway but yeah i i think the big thing about the arena is that the vibes have been totally rancid this whole time oh yeah really hard to like i guess put a fine point on what exactly is wrong with it but the vibes have been so rancid i i've seen the like the like concept illustrations
9398.40 9406.12 SPEAKER_04  and and it's just this weird kind of like box no fuck that basketball at sea like in that one simpsons
9406.12 9411.52 SPEAKER_01  episode yes couldn't they couldn't they flatten the convention center and put it there instead i don't
9411.52 9436.88 SPEAKER_02  know just like i mean the convention center needs to that that could be a whole episode oh my god yeah yeah yeah yeah that's it let's see it's definitely irritating i mean they've done football on the deck of an aircraft carrier irritating to see like a lot of people who are you know talk about like uh um you know we need to have this joke go ahead sorry no you listen listen
9436.88 9442.24 SPEAKER_04  listen what you what you do you take all the superstructure off basketball court and then you you

9474.96 9486.16 SPEAKER_02  a lot of folks from uh the local urbanist organizations saying you know we have to replace this horrible dead super block in the form of the mall with the arena which will also be a horrible
9486.16 9500.16 SPEAKER_04  dead super block um except they've played they've played college college basketball yeah like you can do this you can just do this just do it just do it yeah i i got you i thought you're
9500.16 9523.12 SPEAKER_01  talking about football for a second sorry yeah uh yeah i i yeah okay well yeah it's a very it's a prime location i they they're definitely better things they could do with that space it's a it's a it's a really prime location right in center city that they could be doing different and better things on there yeah um a good one yeah yeah all right but also i agree ros i agree they need to not
9523.12 9534.80 SPEAKER_02  fuck jefferson station like it's it's already yeah market east is a very very nice station i refuse to call it jefferson that's right that's a naming right steel how is it yeah we have several
9534.80 9541.12 SPEAKER_03  names you google nrg or whatever they're calling it now yeah that's an avenue that's patterson drexel
9541.12 9571.12 SPEAKER_02  station at 30th street fuck off no you know what that one did you know what that one did is that when you scroll through the app for arrival times for the l now it's like oh okay you know um you know 46th 40th 34th and then it goes straight to 15th because alphabetically drexel station at 30th is not between 34th and 15th that's that's extremely aggravating yeah
9571.12 9579.76 SPEAKER_01  yeah oh my god yeah well people morons run cities there's a podcast about it yeah that's true
9579.76 9619.36 SPEAKER_02  that's true that's true yeah no gods no man's dot com that was yeah the goddamn news uh oh there we go no we have a segment on this podcast called safety third oh hello justin november liam gareth and struttinger's guest nope fuck you i come to you with a story from a hospital of unspeakable prestige which you may be familiar with you may be familiar with as an institution next to a children's hospital that abuts a csx line carrying hazardous cargo
9619.36 9627.52 SPEAKER_04  yeah okay sure doc your own doc your own place of employment at wtyp pod at gmail.com
9627.52 9635.84 SPEAKER_03  it's better than doxing your home address we have mentioned this hospital numerous times and there's a there's a lot it could be any hospital it could be any hospital there might be a lot of them like
9635.84 9671.60 SPEAKER_02  that i don't know yeah no it's probably yeah yeah okay sure as a resident physician in internal medicine one of our jobs was to respond to codes in the hospital in general a code refers to when a patient has sustained a cardiac arrest also known as dying and we would attempt to revive them with cpr depending on the case sometimes this involves using a defibrillator to shock the patient's heart into a rhythm that can produce a pulse contrary to popular depictions we do not use paddles to shock
9671.60 9678.72 SPEAKER_04  patients figure one is that an obsolete technology they don't cpr you yeah no it's not yeah all the
9678.72 9690.72 SPEAKER_01  defibrillators there's yeah all the different layers that are spread around in like phone boxes now in the uk they all have those little pads uh it's not nearly as exciting you know it's like if a
9690.72 9696.64 SPEAKER_04  phone like a mobile phone entered and stayed in popular culture as a flip phone like forever yes
9696.64 9719.60 SPEAKER_02  instead adhesive pads are stuck on the pavement stuck onto the patient see figure two adhesive paddles are advantageous because they limit downtime between cpr rounds they do not need pressure applied to the chest and they minimize the risk of electric arcing yeah but that electric conductive gel is horrible
9719.60 9736.72 SPEAKER_04  stuff like okay yeah you might still be alive and okay you might be having a horrible time on a more fundamental level level having just been defibrillated and like uh cpr'd but like you gotta get the goop off you and it's gonna get on your chest hair yeah the yucky goop no one wants the yucky goop
9736.72 9740.48 SPEAKER_01  this is true yeah just let me die maybe some people do want yucky goop on them but that's different
9740.48 9766.72 SPEAKER_02  yeah it is standard practice for everyone to clear the patient prior to delivering the shock this is accurately depicted in entertainment anyone who is touching the patient or is touching something that is connected to the patient is hands off now a component of cpr that is underappreciated by the public is that most patients end up intubated which is having a breathing tube placed in them during cpr
9767.76 9775.28 SPEAKER_04  we have been mulling for a while uh a bonus episode about anesthesia and that's still in the works you
9775.28 9823.92 SPEAKER_02  know so we'll we'll get on that sooner or later compressed oxygen then runs through the breathing tube to be delivered to the lungs prior to shocking the patient the respiratory therapist on the case is supposed to disconnect the tube from the ventilator to minimize the risk of sending large amounts of 100 oxygen into an electrical environment oh god today's seemingly apocryphal tale started as a run-of-the-mill cardiac arrest we were faithfully attempting to return someone from the heavens my job was to jam my fingers deep in this patient's groin to palpate a femoral pulse medicine's so glamorous yeah yeah it's such a i love learning things about medicine
9825.12 9844.24 SPEAKER_04  you look at the big mural on the side of the hospital and it's a you know go the square you're pushing death scythe back uh and then you go what's what's going on inside this hospital and it's like fingers fully into the tank yeah exactly the code leader which was one of my co-residents
9844.80 9872.88 SPEAKER_02  called for a pulse check which i did not feel the cardiac rhythm was one that was shockable so the leader called for everyone to clear a shock was delivered and chest compressions resumed then at 12 minutes and seven seconds into the code a smoldering smoky odor rose and the patient burst into flames oh jeez oh ivy league game
9872.88 9890.64 SPEAKER_04  classic patient you know you're just you're just like you're in this you're in this state but you're sort of like between clinical life and clinical death uh the medics are like get back here and you're like i'm gonna do something nobody's gonna expect
9890.64 9898.24 SPEAKER_01  uh what do you do with that point as a medic did you just get your cigarettes out and light it up
9901.92 9908.40 SPEAKER_04  we've got the attendings coming in with marshmallows
9908.40 9979.04 SPEAKER_02  this was not a situation that any of us residents had encountered previously and the patient could not stop drop and roll on account of being dead yeah that'll do it yeah i'm gonna save a lot on cremation costs i can tell you that much luckily luckily a supervising icu physician always oversaw codes from the background and he literally sprang into action in a moment of ingenuity stupidity or both this attending attending physician as some ran into the room leaped and belly flopped onto the patient smothering the fire all right okay cool fuck it yeah after recovering from our astonishment we resumed compressions as if nothing had ever happened unfortunately the patient was not revived but the fire likely had little to do with the outcome they were after all already dead oh my god this is do you remember six
9979.04 9984.56 SPEAKER_04  feet under yeah this is this is the type of shit they used to open episodes yeah yeah
9984.56 9989.28 SPEAKER_02  this is this is like you're doing courtesy cpr you know you have to do it in front of the family
9989.28 10007.76 SPEAKER_04  to look like you're trying yeah yeah i mean do you remember that one video of the the guy like pretending to search people at the entrance to the thing and it's like he's blessing them because he's just doing the like hover hand just doing that but like over the sternum you know yeah i still do not
10007.76 10027.20 SPEAKER_02  know what caused the fire other than a freak accident it is possible 100 oxygenated air made it near the pads and ignited shocks without clearing are being trialed because of the safety of adhesive pads but i certainly am not someone who wants to have my hands on the chest when the electricity is
10027.20 10035.84 SPEAKER_04  delivered after seeing this case we've do we found the least popular doctors to trial uh like not clear and
