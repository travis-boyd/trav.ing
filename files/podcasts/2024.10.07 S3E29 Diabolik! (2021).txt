Passed.
Hello and welcome to another episode of the Italian Cultural Sensitivity Hour.
I'm November Kelly.
I am joined as always by Miyamichi, Abigail Thorne and Devon.
Ciao!
Buongiorno. How we doing everyone?
And we have watched Diabolic.
This movie rules, it's sick, it's so good!
Thank you to the nation of Italy for bringing us this, it's amazing!
This was really good, yeah.
I wish I could go there in person and thank you, but you're really homophobic now.
I just wish Italy were real, is the thing.
That they've provided such beautiful cultural products, you know.
But sadly, the fantasy nation of Italy from movies like Porco Rosso is also the setting for this.
So we saw Danger Diabolic, right?
The Mario Bava movie from the 60s.
Correct.
That we really liked because it was like inventive and kind of like a comic book
and ahead of its time people didn't really appreciate it.
And that's based off of an Italian comic book character, this master thief Diabolic.
Well, in 2020, they made a dark and gritty reboot.
Yeah.
Yeah, it is remarkably dark and gritty.
It's basically just like Casino Royale, but sillier.
Yeah, yeah.
Even the soundtrack is very Casino Royale, which I love, I'm all here for actually.
Yeah, it's like the second is easier, and then he hits him with the knockout gas or whatever,
and he's like, yes, considerably. This movie Diabolic was made in 2020, like during the
pandemic, which was ravaging the fantasy nation of Italy as well.
So like, yes, they really made this movie under adverse conditions.
I didn't know that. I mean, it doesn't show.
Yeah. I mean, this is the thing.
It's remarkable for a movie that came out in 2021, filmed in 2020.
That also makes it a really interesting companion piece to our next bonus episode,
which is going to be The People's Joker, which was also made during COVID,
but it doesn't quite look as good as this.
I prefer the look of The People's Joker to this, but that may be because-
Oh, it's great.
I have a thing about this, right, which is,
I watched movies under some adverse conditions for this podcast.
Because first of all, this was a trial to find, right? Like, a movie that came out three years ago
is very nearly lost media.
Mm-hmm.
It's cool. It rocks doing this job.
I would have paid for this, I would have acquired it through legal means,
I would have then acquired it through illegal means.
Mm-hmm.
Couldn't fucking do that either. I went on like, a quest to find this thing and watch it,
and I finally saw it in 720p with subtitles that were hysterically wrong.
Okay.
Yeah, the subtitles are about like 70% of the way there.
Well, listen, good for you, because what I did was I watched a beautiful,
it was like a 4K rip, fantastic, no subtitles whatsoever.
The whole thing just in Italian.
Dev. Dev. Dev.
I don't know what they said. Yes, what's up?
That was going to be my next question was, do you speak Italian?
I don't personally speak any Italian, but I managed to put together, hey, I put it together
pretty good. There'll probably be a few surprises for you, maybe.
This is unironically, just straightforwardly, a good language learning exercise.
Mm-hmm.
And I got the slightly easier version, which is I had subtitles, but they were machine translated,
and much like my parents, didn't really get pronouns.
Yeah.
So every single pronoun referring to a person or an object was just like randomly incremented
by one, like the enigma machine.
At first, I thought it was quite a charming affectation. People were talking in the third
person about people that were in front of them, so they'd be like, ah, here he is,
and isn't he a handsome stranger? And I was like, oh wow, this is kind of like a fun affectation.
Oh, I see.
Then they started mixing it up, and then it was just like, oh wait, no, it's just fucked.
Yeah, I really threw my parents under the bus with that joke. They don't actually misjudge.
Anyway, the thing is-
You threw me under the bus with that joke too. It was my joke that I made in the group chat
earlier on.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I just stole your joke.
Wow.
Okay.
Brutal.
Listen, as soon as I hit that recording button, the ethics leave my body, and I become a different
and worse person.
We need to go back and record some more episodes of The Ethical Society.
I mean, the thing is, I will watch a movie under really fucked conditions anyway, right?
I've seen really great movies that changed my life on like a hotel TV, you know?
Yes.
I'm a proud member of what I might start calling the motion smoothing movie club.
I've seen like German art films where a woman glides across the screen because the TV has been set up
for like FIFA.
Yeah, look, long time listeners will know I watched Octopussy on the train back to Exeter
while completely gone off Soju.
So like-
And I want to defend myself a little bit here.
You don't need to.
I really tried to get the subtitles working.
Like I tried to rip it.
I went to opensubtitles.com and I like tried to find a setup here and I just, I simply couldn't.
And like, I don't know, maybe if I hadn't spent four hours this week watching Minecraft
parkour content, I could have had more time to look for subtitles maybe.
But that does-
There are two more of these things, so-
I'm hoping the others are easier.
Even harder to find.
I still enjoyed this even though I watched it in fucking hear no evil mode.
Like-
Again, to be clear, this rules.
It's such a good-
First of all, this movie has a great aesthetic.
It's a real like late 60s kind of Team Fortress 2 spy sort of vibe.
Not just because of the mask.
Mm-hmm.
So we open with a black E-type Jaguar, which listeners will recognize as Diabolik's car.
Yeah.
As we know.
He's been driven, he's been chased away from a bank by the cops and he's got his
gimme mask on.
He does.
The unusually tight kind of like latex rubber mask.
Rubber mask still painfully realistic.
The big widow's peak.
Yep.
Just like you can see his lips through it.
It's just really uncomfortable, you know?
Yeah.
It's just not to be like, you know, weird about this, but you have to imagine the cops
are like, is this a sex thing for this guy?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
And the answer is not yet, but it will be later by the end of the movie.
Do we remember a news story about a man by the nom de guerre of the Somerset Gimp?
Of course I remember the Somerset Gimp.
No, the Somerset Gimp, for those of you who don't remember, was a guy who-
It's actually my surname, I never revealed it.
Actually, Devin Gimp.
Devin the Somerset Gimp.
I'm familiar with the Somerset Gimp as a fellow practitioner.
The Somerset Gimp.
Like, I don't mean to put too much of a, like, sort of comic gloss on this,
because he was scaring people.
It was a guy who would dress up in, like, a full rubber gimp fit,
and then sort of lunge at people at night, covered in, like, mud and stuff,
and flail around making weird noises at them.
I recall this.
Okay.
God only knows why.
Um, the other thing I remember about the Somerset Gimp is that the Essex Gimp condemned him.
Absolutely.
Thank you so much.
I was scrolling through my messages trying to remember which Gimp it was.
What?
It was-
It was-
It was-
Another Gimp condemned him as, like, betraying the shared values of Gimps.
Anyway, my point with this is just-
What the fuck?
It's just saying.
You've got a Gimp school, and then you've, like, turned to the dark side?
What the fuck is this?
He's using the power of being a Gimp for evil here.
The Stanislavski method of being a Gimp-
The Gimp is meant to serve the community.
Yeah, the Essex Gimp was like, look, I'm a Gimp only with consenting partners, all right?
You can't just go out there wearing a Gimp suit crawling around.
That's a core principle of the Gimp.
Like, obviously.
The Essex Gimp was quoted as saying-
Oh, shout out to the Gimps.
The consensual Gimps, anyway.
Um, but yeah, so I do wonder if the cops who were chasing him were like, oh, it's the fucking
Claireville Gimp again.
Yeah, we never see how he gets the nickname Diabolic.
His gimping has manifested in the form of crime, you know?
Mm-hmm.
But they were a really good car chase, very well shot.
It's quite slow, I found.
Yeah.
It's a 1960s car chase.
I guess so.
It's fine.
Cars went at like 10 miles an hour then.
That's true.
And plus, you don't want to damage your beautiful Jaguar E-type.
The way he gets away from the cops is he uses a few things, right?
First of all, he hits him with a gas.
We love a gas.
Absolutely.
Step one.
Yeah, the gas has a skull button.
Yeah, which is so funny because like, if he's actually killing those guys, we're like a
minute in.
I think he is.
I think he is.
He's committed.
Well, I hope the fuck he is, right?
Because there's two options here.
One, he has gassed three cops just out of, in order to escape a heist he's done in like
the third minute of the movie.
Or, this is a knockout gas and Diabolic is a keycaps nerd.
Oh, he's just like, miss.
Yeah, he's put a little like custom designed skull thing on there to make himself feel
cool.
I think he does commit murder.
I think these cops are dead.
Yeah.
Oh, no, he definitely kills people later.
He certainly does.
Yeah.
The other way he escapes is he uses the sort of rarer doohickey in a car chase, which is
the external doohickey.
You know, we're used to the car emits something, the car drops something, throws something,
fires something.
Absolutely.
In this case, what he does is he hits a button and a pre-installed ramp in the street.
Yeah, dog.
Yeah, dog.
So, raises up and he like, he like ramps over the roadblock.
Come on.
It's so like, da-da-da-da!
It's so good!
It's so good!
The fuck did you set this up, man?
What is happening?
Because he's Batman, he's just Batman, he's Italian Batman.
He's got plans, okay?
He's put stuff in effect in advance to help his escapes.
Yeah.
And he's being chased by the cops.
Absolutely.
In these beautiful, like, Alfa Ramos.
We will do the Italian job very soon.
Sooner than you can imagine.
Mm-hmm.
But one of the cops is Inspector Jinko.
Mm-hmm.
Diabolic Senegata.
His nemesis.
The Tom to his Jerry.
Exactly.
Mm-hmm.
And he drives through the gas with the simple expedient of, like, putting his coat over his mouth.
Mm-hmm.
And the thing is, the music choices in this are baffling.
Because Jinko is driving after him with his boys in his Citroen DS.
And Diabolic's music is the kind of, like, active heist music thing.
And then Jinko is in his car listening to what really sounds like Italian Snow Patrol.
I liked the opening credits song.
I do, too, but it's so disjointed that he's got the radio on.
He's listening to Petulia della Neve.
And he's fucking, like, it gives it the real romantic cast, actually.
You know?
Yeah, it's cool, actually.
Mm-hmm.
So they follow him up through the winding hills.
I can see the back of his jag.
And then the back of the jag goes over a cliff.
And they pull up on it.
And they realize it's a fake back of a car.
He's like, he's swapped.
It's only got two wheels and, like, a couple bits of doors.
He's swapped it out.
And then they're just like, oh, my God, he's fooled us.
And we get the title.
It's perfect.
It's so good.
Yeah, my only note is, yeah, that's some diabolic shit right there.
Let's go.
We're in for it, baby.
He has built a fake car ass in order to deceive his nemesis.
It's fantastic.
It's amazing.
I love it.
So after the titles, we realized we were in Clairville, which is a skiing town in the
Alps in the 60s.
And we meet Giorgio, who's a little guy with a mustache.
He's like a political functionary.
He's like, what, the junior justice minister?
Yeah, he's the vice minister of justice.
And he's a little creep, you know?
He's like Italian West Streeting.
Yeah.
We see him kind of toadying up to, like, his boss and his boss's boss at this, like,
Alpine ski lodge, you know?
Yes, yeah.
And then I'm afraid I've been completely destroyed and will remain destroyed for the remainder
of the movie.
All right, here we go, folks.
I was watching this with my wife, who, as you might be able to guess from context clues,
is also a lesbian.
And we were watching the bulk of this movie, like, biting down on our hands, like, oh my
fucking god.
At this point, we meet Ava Kant, who we remember.
Remember, is not yet, because this is an origin story, but will be at some point Diabolix
girlfriend.
And she is played by...
Miriam Leone, who, if you can believe it, was Miss Italy.
So when we say this woman is beautiful, bear in mind, we mean quantitatively.
She is officially one of the most 195 beautiful women in the world.
I hate this shit when men do it, right?
Probably smaller, because I don't think there is a Miss Vatican City.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Interesting contest.
But, like, to do the reply guy thing, to be like, I would crawl 18 miles over broken
glass to, like, throw my coat over a puddle for you tonight, Queen.
That's just how I feel.
Like, she looks incredible.
So she is a very beautiful woman.
Yeah.
But also, I have made so many detailed notes about her outfits throughout this movie.
The fits are incredible.
Yeah.
No, the fits are unbelievable.
Oh!
This one isn't even the best one.
Honestly, it's incredible.
And this is a low point.
Because, like, it's this amazing, like, almost black navy dress.
It's got a white section at the front, which comes right up to the middle of your thighs.
So it looks like you're just pussy out.
It gives the illusion of the thighs.
It's also got a bit on the waist as well.
Like, it's beautiful.
And whoever has styled this actor has given her, like, really, really small little earrings, too.
And she's got, like, one serpent necklace and, like, a very, very high-tight hairstyle that just, like, really accentuates her natural beauty.
It's so simple.
It's so Italian.
Mwah!
Beautiful.
She has so many great earrings in this movie.
It's such a small detail.
But, like, I...
Also, you may have heard me mention on Twitter or shouting at traffic that I want surgery to get...
The, like, Italian, like, Roman nose, right?
Like, I want the reverse nose surgery to give me that, right?
And she has that, and it's beautiful.
It's fantastic.
Anyway.
Yeah, I've just paused it on a, like, a profile show.
She's got an incredible profile.
She was, like, what, 30...
37?
36 when this was filmed?
There is still time.
I got four years to lock this shit down.
Like, she's older than me.
I'm like, I was about to say, how do you get your forehead to be that smooth?
And the answer is you just have incredibly high, tight hairstyles.
But...
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's for me.
She's got a Romford facelift, I guess, throughout the whole movie.
Yeah, but it's like a Clairville facelift.
It's a what facelift?
Clairville.
The place where we are.
Clairville facelift, yeah.
720p is not enough for Italian women.
Um, but so, she is, uh, this, like, socialite.
She is newly arrived back in Clairville from South Africa.
Indeed.
Doing what?
What?
Why is this white woman?
In the 60s?
Not clear.
I just heard the name South Africa a couple of times.
Yeah, this white woman has been in South Africa in the 60s doing We Know Not What.
Uh, well, she was married to Lord Kant.
Yes.
Who, uh, was killed in a hunting accident.
He was killed in a hunting accident.
To give you a preview of how fucked the subtitles were for me, this is rendered by them as he
died in an accident in a big game.
Jumanji, actually.
He died in an accident at the big game, like Maude Flanders.
He got shot off the fucking stadium.
Yeah, Wildebeest shot him with a t-shirt.
God damn.
But yeah, so, her husband is dead.
She doesn't want to remarry.
My husband is dead.
She only...
Yeah, exactly.
Only want to sell this beautiful diamond.
Mm-hmm.
She has this pink diamond that she is bringing back to Clairville from South Africa.
Certainly the bloodiest of blood diamonds you can imagine.
Oh, of course.
Yeah, that diamond was white when they started.
Mm.
But so, they also talk about, well, what's going on around town?
Well, there's this dangerous super criminal diabolic.
Oh, shit.
And the local law enforcement, they're going to catch him no matter what.
And Lady Khan, I know you might find the thought of a super criminal exhilarating,
but be sure that you never fall in love with him or fuck him.
Yeah, and it's zooming in slowly on her face.
She's like, I would never fuck a dangerous super criminal.
And she's just like biting her lip like she's the woman who's just eaten the cum cake in the Matrix.
And to be clear, they're talking about a guy and they're like...
The cake that makes you cum in...
They're like, by the way, he did gas three cops to death, just so you know.
Yeah, he did commit murder earlier tonight.
Yeah.
He does wear a gimp suit as well.
Like, you're only telling her the sexy parts of this.
You should have led with the gimp suit.
You should have led with the kill gas.
I mean, maybe that is sexy to her.
We don't know.
I think Ava's...
This is a little character study into what is sometimes called hybristophilia.
The attraction to criminals.
Huh.
Yeah, there's a hint of misogyny actually in Ava's character.
So she's like walking back from the party.
We see...
I'm sorry, I need to stop this again.
She's walking back from the party in the dress that she was wearing before, but also white
maxi length collar fastened coat that is fastened only at the collar with a satin bow.
She also has like pink to white ombre nails, which is just so simple and beautiful.
It's an incredible, incredible outfit.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, no.
The only thing that doesn't work for me are the shoes, which are closed toe and pointy,
and I'm like, maybe it's period accurate, but it just doesn't look great.
We see that Giorgio, the deputy minister for justice, has like tried to like hiss on her
in a sort of like vaguely polite way, and she's brushed him off, right?
She walks home.
We get a bit of like pointless threat as someone is walking up behind her.
It's a cool camera angle, though.
True.
We're like behind and above.
It's free.
Nicely shot.
Puts his hand on her shoulder, and it's Jinko.
It's Inspector Zenigata, who takes her for a cup of tea, which by the way, insane.
The way this woman moves, the way she like handles like a cup of tea, is just like, it's
giving me like dysphoria five.
I've blasted through the previous four, and now I'm just like, how do I learn to like hold
a teacup like this?
It reminds me very strongly of a time when I was dating a model, and she
I was walking in front of her, and I walked down some stairs, and she like stopped me
in public and was just like, no, if you walk like that, like you'll be clocked.
Like this is how you walk up and down stairs like a woman, like a model, and like showed
me how to do it.
That's so toxic.
I need that.
I need the fucking-
It was incredibly devastating and prompted a very big argument that we had that night,
but she was also correct.
Yeah.
There's a little bit of like finishing school shit that I got from dating a model.
I am willing to enroll myself in the most toxic bullshit you can possibly imagine if
the price of it is I get to drink a cup of tea like this.
But so Jinko is like this guy diabolic.
I think there's online classes, I'm sure.
You can just watch this movie and copy it.
I'm trying.
Diabolic is the most dangerous and sexy criminal we have.
Yes.
Facts.
Massive, massive cock as well.
I'm not him.
I'm not him in a mask, but he's really cool.
I just took this to be pure homoerotic because I have like immediately cast Diabolic and Jinko
as like enemies to lovers.
As we later discover, like spoilers, but this is Diabolic in disguise, so it's not even homoerotic.
It's like autoerotic.
It's AP.
It's autoandrophilic.
He's like.
So it's AGP.
He's attracted to himself as Jinko.
Auto Jinkophile.
Auto Jinkophile.
Auto Jinkophile.
Oh, fuck.
Okay.
Yeah.
So anyway, Jinko in quotes is just like, yo, diabolic, extremely sexy criminal.
Yes.
Huge dick.
Probably going to steal your pink diamond.
And she's like, how does Diabolic know I have a pink diamond?
And he's like, fucking informants probably.
I don't know.
He's got spies everywhere.
He's got guys.
Don't tell anyone about this.
But like anyone you're talking to could be diabolic.
By the way, where's the diamond queen?
Yeah.
And she tells him.
She's like, oh, there's going to be a fake one in the hotel safe.
And I'm going to keep the real one in my room safe.
There's a lot of safes in this.
So can I keep it in my, my sexy bedroom safe underneath my underwear?
When you're watching a film in a language you don't understand and a word keeps coming
up, you will learn the fuck out of that word.
And that's how I learned that the Italian of the safe is casa forte.
Yeah.
Like secure house.
Strong box.
Strong box.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's fun.
And so she's like, ah, so you're going to make me the bait in a trap to catch diabolic.
And he's like, ah, I'm terrible.
I mean, yeah, sure.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I'm 100%.
She's too clever for her own good.
She's sussing out plans from the shit that he made up as a pretense.
Yeah.
By the way, this woman, I, we've described her a lot, but like at this point, the resemblance
hits me and I realize she looks like Italian Kristen Stewart, like high, high femme Kristen
Stewart, like ultra femme and also Italian.
I think she just has cheekbones.
The chin and the nose are completely different than Kristen Stewart.
I love when women have cheekbones.
Anyway.
So she goes to.
She probably says something about me that I can like instantly conjure an image like
Professor X of Kristen Stewart's face.
I'm just like, no, the chin and cheekbones.
Double checking.
No.
Get my fucking head examined.
Anyway.
She arrives at the hotel.
Yeah.
They're choosing who's going to be her personal waiter.
Yes.
Because of course, Lady Count will not be dining in the dining room with the fucking peasants.
Of course.
She's going to be getting room service all the time.
And we see that one of the waiters, the guy called Roberto, is, he's kind of bragging.
He's like, oh, well, obviously the manager's going to pick me because I'm hot, right?
I'm the hottest waiter here.
And then we see that Diabolic is listening in on this.
Roberto leaves.
And my favorite piece of acting in this whole movie, it's just a really quiet thing, is
that Roberto is walking like he's getting a fit off.
He's fully...
He is a little bit, isn't he?
He's strutting.
He's confident.
Yeah.
If you go back and watch, he's walking like, holy shit, I'm getting a fit off.
That other guy looks like shit.
He's not either.
He's wearing like a cropped leather jacket and like a sort of V-neck sweater.
He's pleased with himself because, you know, he's going to be Lady Kant's personal room
service spotlight for the next few days, which I'm sure makes him feel great.
But in fact, he's stalked by the soundtrack to Casino Royale.
And then Diabolic stabs him to death and dumps his fucking body in a sewer.
The Iabolic kills his ass.
Straight up escalates to a murder.
With a knife.
Yeah.
He throws a knife into his back, ruining his like cropped leather jacket.
And the thing is...
He is walking like he's getting a fit off.
He is.
He is.
He's got to come back.
He is.
Once you notice it.
The other thing is we get like knife cam, where we have the camera on the knife in flight.
That's the kill cam that he saw after he got hit by it.
A little Breaking Bad action with the camera on the other thing.
He legitimately like gets his body dumped in a sewer like a Hitman level as well.
So then we see that Diabolic is in his lair, which unlike the Mario Bava movie, they landlordized
it.
It's all great.
Yeah, it's bullshit.
It's brushed steel.
I know.
Shit little lair.
It's much more like the Batcave.
I don't like it as much, but it does give us a nice bit of character trait about Diabolic,
which is that he is obsessively dedicated.
This is actually really cool.
This is an audacious choice by the movie.
Also, maybe this suggests that like Eva fucking femmed up the Batcave, given that this is an
origin story.
Anyway.
Yeah.
Hopefully in the next one, it's all like crazy and there's domes and colored glass everywhere.
Yeah.
It's like, hey, can you get some dones?
Can you get some colored glass?
Step one.
Dones.
You get two side-by-side showers.
But so he's got this reel-to-reel tape where he's been recording the waiters' conversation,
and he is listening back to the same line of Roberto's dialogue where he's like, holy shit,
I'm getting a fit off, and mimicking him, holy shit, I'm getting a fit off.
He's doing voice training.
Yeah.
He does this like 20 times until he's nailed Roberto's holy shit, I'm getting a fit off
line.
And he's like, I have become him.
Yeah.
Cool.
He's learning to imitate him.
This is all done in one shot that very gradually pulls out from the tape recorder.
It's also the first time we see Diabolic's face.
It's really funny that his hairline matches the hairline of his mask.
Yeah, he's got the most brutal widow's peak in the entire world.
Second most brutal, I've got mine.
I want to know if that was the actor or whether they shaved him or whatever.
Fucking Vegeta-ass hairline.
So the next day, we're at the hotel.
The hotel manager is like...
Ah, not yet, I'm afraid.
Not yet.
Oh, okay.
We have to cut to a character who's going to be important later, but who I was briefly
sort of baffled by the appearance of.
Oh, yeah.
There are two ladies chatting in the public square.
Oh, yeah.
And one of them is Miss...
Not important.
Miss Supporting Actor.
And the other is Elizabeth.
And they are chatting about their husbands.
And we surmise that Elizabeth's husband, Walter Dorian, is extremely rich.
She's married to Bruce Wayne, BC.
Yeah.
But he's always away.
And she hates the loneliness, despite all the money.
And her friend is just like, but he's got so much money.
And he's like a successful, huge, dicked businessman.
He definitely isn't a criminal.
And she's like, but I wish he was at home not being a criminal, instead of out doing
I don't know what.
Yeah.
She loves him and she misses him.
It's sad.
Don't get attached to this character.
No.
All right.
Now we go to the hotel.
Yeah.
The next day.
And we're trying to organize everything ahead of Ava's arriving.
At which point I point at the screen and go, motherfucker, for a reason that's completely
opaque to everyone but me, which is that I recognize the actor playing the hotel manager.
It's an Italian character actor called Roberto Citran.
I know this because of a fucking Italian TV series called Il Cacciatore that I watched.
And yeah.
Hell yeah.
I just include this detail to be like, Roberto Citran.
Cool guy.
Good actor.
Nice.
Guy we love to see.
Yeah, absolutely.
If I had thought about this ahead of time, I would have plugged that into Google Translate,
but I didn't.
So.
There we go.
Nice.
Regats.
We love to see.
Yes.
So, but you know, Roberto's not here.
Where is he?
He's late for work.
Oh, here he is.
Quite clearly diabolic in disguise, but played by the same actor who played Roberto because
he's got the Mission Impossible mask technology.
He's got the Mission Impossible mask.
Me too.
I like this conceit.
They do this a few times.
I like that they're getting the supporting actors to play the main character in disguise.
Yeah, it's nice.
It's just fun.
Saves you a lot of money too because you don't have to have your lead actor on set all the
time.
They do a good job as well.
They do.
They do a great job.
So Roberto, like Roberto, takes her to the room, runs a bath for her, is very creepily watching
her the whole time.
Black hat, cream coat, black and white mini dress, black cut.
Oh my God.
Beautiful.
It's beautiful.
Audrey Hepburn fit.
Yeah, it's Audrey Hepburn coded.
Yeah, 100%.
Black earring, like massive wall hood.
Wonderful.
Really great shot composition, by the way.
I don't talk about that.
Like, I love the way this movie is put together.
It's very comic book-y.
You feel like they really, really liked the Diabolic series.
There's a shot later on that really stuck out.
It's a completely like sort of low consequence shot of like a light snapping on someone's house
to indicate they're awake.
But it's perfectly comic book.
And it really grabbed me.
And like, it does, it has a little touch.
It's not as extensive as the 60s one, which is almost entirely filmed like a series of comic book panels.
Yes.
There are quite a few moments in this one where I'm like, oh, interesting.
Mm-hmm.
So as she's running a bath, Diabolic tries to crack her safe, but the phone rings.
She comes out of the bathroom in a white fluffy bathrobe with gold flat slippers.
Beautiful.
And it's Giorgio on the phone and says, why don't you come over to my place tonight at 9.30?
Because we're in Italy and that's madly deemed to be an acceptable time to start the evening.
Well, you need like three hours of bathing time, two hours of hair and makeup, you know.
Yeah, I do, but I just start that at 1 p.m.
Yeah.
And then I'm ready for dinner at like seven because I'm a normal person.
I'm starting my dinner at half nine.
Are you insane?
Like, that's only an hour before bedtime.
Yeah.
You nuts.
Starting dinner.
Like, I'm going to order.
It's going to be 45 minutes before the food comes out.
What's happening to her?
This is crazy.
Yeah, I'm going to be asleep.
I'm going to go to bed.
You want to like wine and dine me and then have sex?
It's going to be like 1 a.m. before we even get back.
Like, no way.
Anyway.
Things to do tomorrow.
Diabolic has to flee the scene.
Yeah.
And we see that he goes home.
Mm.
Mm.
To the Bat Mansion, to Wayne Manor.
Mm-hmm.
Where his wife has been like clearly waiting for him.
Mm-hmm.
And he's just like standing at the window doing the like kind of INTJ pose.
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
And she is shocked to see him.
She's very happy to see him because she loves him.
And he's like, uh, don't get attached.
I'm going back out in like 10 minutes.
He is such an asshole to her.
Oh, he's a massive man.
Like, please stay.
I love you.
Stay with me.
I'll cook you dinner.
I'll do whatever you want.
And he just goes, I don't like it when you act like that.
And it's like, what the fucking Seto Kaiba ass motherfucker?
Yeah, I don't like this guy.
The comparison that I had for it was the sort of worst bits of Fifty Shades of Grey, right?
Yes.
Yeah, totally.
It's like a bad DS relationship he's got with this woman because she does not like it, right?
She's not in the kind of Pedro von Kant situation of, well, spoilers for that movie, but she's
not in this situation where she's like, oh, you know, he treats me like shit and he's
very cold to me and I love it.
She hates this fucking guy and he just keeps doing it.
But so across town, Giorgio is setting up his 9pm dinner.
He is wearing, we want to talk about costuming, the worst item of clothing I have ever seen
in a film ever.
But also like so well selected because you can tell he thinks this looks great.
He's wearing, how to describe this?
This is the jacket, obviously.
Yeah.
This is reprehensible.
Shows it from the Technicolor dream coat on a formal dinner ass.
What?
Ludicrous fit.
Looks like a bad pair of like curtains have been made into a jacket here.
Yeah.
It's like someone like ate a bunch of paisley and then threw up.
It's real gross.
There are blues.
It's gold trimmed.
There are reds.
It's awful.
It's asymmetric.
Like a tapestry.
It's nice as well because it's like a, it's a guy who doesn't have a lot of money or taste.
It's like a nouveau riche jacket.
It's like this, this is what somebody who doesn't have a lot of money thinks rich people
wear and it would be very expensive, but it's not elegant.
It's not like, it's not just like a really, you know, sharply cut, like, like black suit
or like a Tom Ford thing.
It's just like, blah.
It's like, it's very show-offy, right?
And absolutely kicking him out of the water is Ava.
Who's, who's in all white and minus say, is this a dress, a blouse?
I can't even tell what this thing is, dog.
It's got like bits cut out of it and bows and shit.
I'm just like, what are you wearing?
And how quickly can you take it off?
This is why you have to have dinner at 9pm is because you need five hours to get into
your shapes.
And also like, how are you going to eat anything?
This is Italy.
You're going to be having spaghetti.
Like it's going to get everywhere all over that white outfit.
The other Italian cultural sensitivity out, I got the boff button back as well.
Boff.
Bastard.
If you press it too fast, it really turns into like moans.
Boff.
Boff.
I don't want to hear Jared Leto moan.
So he's shooting his shot, right?
Yeah.
Also, she's not buying it.
And the thing is, right, you may know this about me.
When a woman is slightly irritated and annoyed, 10 trillion percent.
I'm sorry.
But even the way that she reacts to his assault is so cunty.
Because he's like, Ava, I love you.
And he like grabs her and puts his hand around her waist and like pulls in as if to kiss.
He doesn't kiss her.
And she just goes, Giorgio, please.
She rolls her eyes.
She does.
Oh my God.
And he backs off.
And it's like, oh my God.
Withering.
And she says, it's been a nice evening so far.
Don't ruin it.
It's like, oh, dude.
It's over for you, man.
Mm.
Mm-hmm.
By the way, every time he meets her, he does the like kissing her hand thing, but he does
it too much.
It's a kind of a Craig finger suck situation.
He's like, he's not letting go of it.
Mm.
So I see this guy and all I think is, put on a proper suit.
David Cameron don't laugh.
I was looking for drops.
It's one of the only things I have is fucking Cameron.
So she, she leaves, albeit under this kind of like having had this menacing experience
where he has been like pathetic, but also like, I love you, marry me.
Mm-hmm.
You know, I'll give you this incredible life together.
I don't think he's actually explicitly threatened her yet.
He's just been kind of quite aggressive about it.
Well, so we, we cut away and we'll see the rest of their evening later on.
Yeah.
So she, she gets back to her hotel room.
Oh my God.
The fur coat, the kind of like the pale fur coat is so, oh my God.
I'm always just skipping forward to see this.
Oh wow.
Every one of those minks died for a noble cause, which is a woman looking hot.
Also, mink, there's loads of them.
There's loads of them.
They're really easy to breathe.
They're really easy to keep.
They're like huge carries of COVID.
Hi, hello everyone.
Kill them, kill them.
Take your strong pro fur stance.
Get your second hand fur if you want fur.
It's better than microplastics.
It degrades, it lasts longer.
It's biodegradable.
Probably not for the mink.
What?
What do you want from me?
It's a socialist podcast.
I know.
Well, it's biodegradable.
It's eco-socialism.
I used to date the same model who taught me how to walk up and down stairs.
Also had a fur fetish.
Can you teach me to do this?
So I know a little bit about fur.
Yes, I will.
But she had a fur fetish, which is why I know about fur.
She had several fur coats.
Fur fetish?
Like with a mink glove?
Like the mink massage glove?
Yes, yes.
Jealous with the mink glove?
Cut down.
We're out of here.
They're choking my shit with the mink glove.
Choking my shit on mink glove Twitter.
So she gets back.
Diabolic is never going to get to crack this fucking safe.
I've had a real life.
I'm like...
I'm just looking out the window right now.
Had woman who is like 20 or 30 years away from aging into like early Cruella de Vil.
No, I'm just, I'm looking back.
I am still having a hell of a life, but I'm also looking back.
I'm like, I've had some experiences.
I think we all have, probably.
Yeah.
We're doing Kilchand's one in like 10 years time.
You're in the full Cruella de Vil outfit.
November's a cop.
And I...
Uh-huh, yeah.
What are you doing?
I don't know what I'm doing.
Uh-huh.
I don't know what my weakness is.
I'm probably in prison.
It's just like, if we're all doing the stuff that's going to get us cancelled,
you're in prison for like, pledging explicit support to...
Yeah, that's absolutely true, yeah.
Like...
Jesus.
It's a prescribed terror group, alright?
It is.
You can't say, but you like it.
To the point that we'll probably have to cut that bit.
Um, so...
Just bleep it.
Just bleep it.
We are supporting bleep.
Could be anything.
Just bleep it.
It's always funny when you bleep things.
Anyway, Diabolic breaks into the hotel room, and he cracks the safe.
He's getting edged by this fucking safe, right?
Because, like, he opens it just in time for Ava to come back.
Mm-hmm.
He holds a knife to her throat.
Yes.
She's not afraid.
No, she matches his freak, right?
And this is...
Yeah.
She's, like, into it, you know?
Yeah, no.
No, she's not not into it.
Yes.
She's not afraid.
Yeah, I think she's getting into it, you know?
He even says, like, you're not afraid of him?
And she's like, no, I serve cunt.
Mm-hmm.
And then she says, you're wasting your time.
The diamond is fake.
The real one was sold.
Because when I was still married to Lord Cunt, when he was alive, before he died at the big game,
with a big foam finger...
Lord Cunt.
Now, who do I have to usurp to get that title?
Choking on a hot dog at the big game.
Hit by a packet of peanuts from a peanut seller at the big game.
I was blackmailed.
Because some blackmailers, some South African gangsters came to me, and they threatened to reveal some things about my past to my husband.
And so I had to sell the real diamond.
She says, see for yourself.
Take it.
Examine it.
If it's real, then come back and kill me.
If it's fake, then please bring it back.
Dread Pirate Roberts ass.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
He does, right?
She also...
Well, so she says, bring it back, because I want to wear it and be the most admired, the most beautiful.
And he says, you don't need a diamond for that.
And then they almost kiss, but he vanishes.
He edges her.
That's not cringe, that's so good!
No, but the disappearing is good.
Like, I don't know.
I think if a woman this beautiful tried to kiss me, I would also do what he does, which is run away instantly and disappear, because I panic.
Yeah, no, I'm reading it that way.
I'm gonna go with that.
He's just doing a little shuffle across the room and diving out of the window, you know?
But so he goes back to the Batcave, and he examines this diamond where he discovers that it is, in fact, fake, and she has not lied to him.
And Elizabeth sees him coming out of the Batcave, and he fucking gaslights it.
He's like, you're crazy, you must have seen things in the shadows, you're nuts, you're insane, my dear, quite insane!
You know what this is, besides Fifty Shades of Grey?
I personally don't know anyone who would use this as a paradigm to explore abuse and toxic relationships.
It's kind of Dracula-like.
Like, it's not helped by the gigantic Widow's Peak, yeah, but he's like, oh, he didn't see anything, you know?
The big lapels.
Maybe it was a shadow.
And he, like, threatens her physically.
He, like, doesn't, like, choke her exactly, but he puts his hand quite firmly on the front of her neck.
And is just like...
On the kind of, under the auspices of checking her pulse to be like, you seem like you're agitated.
And then, with the sort of implication being like, if you say, you're diabolic, aren't you?
He'll just fucking kill her.
Which is not nice.
Nuts!
Like, it's not, like...
Here's your protagonist, question mark?
Yeah, totally.
I have some thoughts about how this movie does this.
But she's, like, you know, reading between the lines here, she's like, no, I'm totally chill with this, actually.
I'm just, I'm insane, actually.
Yeah, oh, you're right, I'll go to bed again.
And I'm totally not gonna poke around in the garden the second you're gone.
And the next day, Ava wakes up, having slept in pink eyeshadow and fake lashes, which she wasn't wearing when she came in.
So that means she came in from...
These are different fake eyelashes, yeah.
Oh, those are her sleeping eyelashes.
From dinner, took her makeup off, put different makeup on, and went to sleep in it?
Insane!
She's going through, like, pints of micellar water a day.
She set her alarm early so that she could wake up, get a full face of makeup, and then pretend to wake back up again for, like, whoever's coming into the room at that time.
Yeah, also her hair was straight and pinned up last night, and now it's cold, so...
Yeah, obviously.
Baffling.
I have a slight problem here, which is, I also wrote this note in a hurry, and I can't read the last word of my own handwriting.
So I don't know what this relates to.
It could be anything in the movie, so long as it happens after this.
But my note says, in Europe, this is a common occurrence.
He's just, and then I cannot read this fucking word.
So I don't know.
What is a common occurrence in Europe that happens in this movie?
I don't know.
I don't know what's said in the scene.
He's just...
Fritchling?
What did I mean by this?
Fringy?
No clue.
Anyway, so Roberto, in quotes, brings her breakfast in bed, and then she lifts the cloche, and the ring is underneath it.
So she calls him back and is like, Roberto, have you met Diabolic, famous super criminal?
And he's like, no, I haven't.
Massive penis, I've heard.
She's like, that's a shame, because I would love to S that D if Diabolic...
I'd love to suck that Diabolic if he was.
And he says, but wouldn't you be afraid to meet such an incredibly big, dicked, and handsome criminal?
And she's like, no, I would love it, actually.
And he takes off the Mission Impossible mask, revealing his true face.
Really good VFX work here.
Yeah, remarkably.
I actually think Roberto's slightly better looking, but whatever.
I actually agree a little.
He takes it off and is like, oh.
Roberto looks a bit like a really young...
Oh, God.
Who's the guy in Brazil?
Price?
Never seen it.
You've never seen Brazil?
Jonathan Price.
He looks like a really young Jonathan Price.
Roberto does.
Anyway.
But yeah, I kind of...
I can't decide whether I like or am badly irritated by this kind of, like, Fontema shit, you know?
Yeah.
Like, the kind of, like, gentleman thief stuff.
The ring under the cloche is a bit much, you know?
I like that.
I don't like the kind of misogyny thief.
The misogyny thief.
You know, I hear that in Europe this is a common occurrence.
Maybe.
She shags him.
In Europe it's a common occurrence.
That is a common occurrence, I've heard.
And then afterwards, she says, how did you know about the ring?
And he's like, ah, because it was me in the scene where you met Jinko.
Mm-hmm.
Ah.
Motherfucker.
I was also...
Everyone you've met so far has been me.
All of them have gone, isn't Diabolic hot?
Isn't he a big dick?
Meanwhile, Elizabeth is at home.
She's in the classic...
She's wearing, like, a dressing gown that's sort of, like, unkempt.
She's drinking a cup of tea and looking at the spot in the garden where she saw Diabolic.
I'm not crazy.
I am not crazy.
I'm looking at that shit.
I'm gonna go look.
But so she finds the Batcave and she is horrified, not least because he's got a bunch of the latex masks just up on heads.
Yeah, this is a really fun shot because it's just of her seeing them and she starts screaming and then, like, almost like Zardoz style, the rubber masks start appearing in the frame around her face.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Interesting shot list.
Pretty good.
Very comic book.
Oh!
I remember fritzling in Europe finding the secret basement bunker of your husband is a common occurrence.
He's just fritzling.
God fucking dammit, yes!
She found the secret basement, alright.
Now we get it.
Fuck's sake.
He's just fritzling.
He's just fritzling, guys.
Mm-hmm.
It's like a sort of common stage of the European male.
Hmm.
She calls the cops, right?
Yeah, she would.
Because she's not down with this, like, this Batman situation, you know?
She thought she married Bruce Wayne.
Yeah.
And the cops, led by Jinko, show up and they stake out the place.
So when Diabolic comes back to the Batcave, he is gonna get nicked.
They're gonna catch him, yeah.
Yeah.
But he's still talking to the most beautiful woman in the world.
What was her name again?
Ava.
Ava.
He's still talking to Ava in the hotel room.
And then she says, do you have a woman?
And he's like, actually, I'm married to this woman, Elizabeth, but, like, I'm gonna leave
her soon and give her a bunch of money and just fuck off because I don't want to be with
her anymore, which I'm like, harsh, dude.
Yeah.
And she says, I'm actually engaged.
She's being upfront about these things, I suppose.
I'm engaged to Giorgio.
And he's like, what?
So we have a flashback to the rest of the evening together.
Which means we get to see the jacket again.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And Giorgio confesses his love and says he's gonna blackmail her if she doesn't marry
him.
Because what if the deputy justice minister, me, Giorgio, investigated that death of the
big game of your husband?
And what if everyone found out you, you're not an aristocratic lady at all.
You used to be a nightclub performer and a criminal and a committer of industrial espionage.
This does not wholly add up as a blackmail thing, but I think it's because you can't
use anything spicier and keep the rating, you know?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's like, you were a nightclub singer.
And I was like, oh.
And?
Oh, no.
But yeah, so he forces her to accept his engagement proposal on pain of blackmail.
Yeah.
He has a file on her in his safe and Diabolic is like, I will get this for you, queen.
He does say that as well, which is very funny as well, to be like, I got a file on you in
my safe, in my office, at work.
I can give you the address if you like, it's the third door on the left.
It's on my business card.
Do you like the code to the safe?
Door sticks a bit, so you might need to.
But so, yeah.
Diabolic is like, given that this is the most beautiful woman he's ever seen, it's like,
well, now you've seen my face, I can either kill you or trust you.
And because she's completely unfazed by this, he's like, okay, fine.
I fold instantly.
I will go and get you this file about you.
I just need to make one stop off at the Batcave.
Yeah.
We get some comedy where the manager of the hotel comes in and is looking for Roberto,
obviously thinking that Roberto has porked the VIP guest and Diabolic has to hide in the
wardrobe.
In Europe, this is a common occurrence.
A kind of sex comedy of errors.
They also establish that they both know Morse code because Ava taps in Morse code on the
wardrobe to signal for him when to leave.
This is kind of fun.
Also, she changes at this point into a different bathrobe, navy blue with quilted leather lapels.
Love it.
I think she puts a bathrobe on over her bathrobe because the first bathrobe wasn't decent enough.
Which...
I guess.
Insane.
So, he leaves and he heads back to the Batcave.
Jinko and some cops get him at gunpoint and he edges forwards towards a kind of like a
bathroom light ceiling pull cord thing with his hands up.
Very obviously about to pull the thing.
He's like, I wouldn't let him do that.
No, no.
You're going to pull the thing, aren't you?
He does.
Pull the string.
He does.
Yeah.
And he blinds everybody.
Oh, you'd hate to reach for the flashbang cord when you're going to the bathroom, you know?
Middle of the night, you're like, where the fuck is the...
See a trans person in there?
Boom!
The funniest thing about this scene, right, is he runs up the stairs, out of the Batcave,
is immediately held at gunpoint in the same way by two other cops.
And in this moment, I'm just looking for him to pull another cord that comes down from
the sky.
From the sky!
Yeah.
Doesn't make it.
But meanwhile, so he actually arranged to meet Hieber.
Oh, fuck, I forgot this.
She was just like, promise me you won't be late.
I've met men like you before who get what they want and promise me the world and then
leave.
And I'm like, really?
I have RSD.
Please do not like...
Maybe you should stop dating men.
Yeah.
Babe.
Please keep this engagement.
And he's like, I will, I promise.
Diabolic doesn't break his promises.
Yeah.
But he gets arrested.
And he gets arrested and put into the most insane handcuffs I've ever seen.
Yes.
Yeah, real manacle type shit.
What's happening here?
Yeah, they manacle my boy.
And we see that Ava is in this cafe waiting.
And anytime anyone comes up to her, including the waiter, she's like, yo, is that Diabolic
under there?
And it's not.
And she's wearing a Bulgari watch, which we are shown many times.
The Bulgari Serpenti.
Yes.
Yes.
Bulgari Serpenti.
Beautiful.
I paused the movie in order to show this to my wife.
To be like, yo, check these out.
With a black coat.
She's got big pearl earrings, a black jacket, white gloves, and she has like a fox fur shawl,
which is just like a dead fox.
It's one of those like old fashioned ones where it's just a fucking dead animal.
Which I don't think looks quite as good.
It can work in some circumstances.
It doesn't mean.
The Bulgari Serpenti.
Those circumstances being the 1960s in Italy.
I mean, I need to make that much money is the thing.
So we see from this beautiful watch that she waits for him for two hours.
Wow.
Down horrendous.
Down cataclysmic.
Two hours is so long.
Not in Italy.
I guess so.
Yeah.
The movie doesn't really have the courage of its convictions to do the whole like, you
know, convention here.
She overhears some people being like, yo, Diabolic got arrested.
Did you hear about this?
It's crazy.
Yeah.
To be fair, you would be saying loudly, right?
If it happened.
Also, like her conclusion from this is, oh my God, I've got to help him because I really
like him and not.
Oh my God.
I guess he's actually shit at being a thief.
I should have gotten someone else.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He hasn't done the like one job that you wanted him to do.
I hasn't even tried it yet.
She's like, I've got infinite money.
Why don't I just bribe Giorgio?
What am I doing?
Succumbing to black men?
What if I just give him a lot of money?
So he goes to trial and she's, she's in the stands, like she's in the gallery watching
him.
Gold earrings, white hat, gilded cream jacket of a matching gilded cream top with gold bracelet.
Oh my God.
The public gallery is shouting like, uh, they're shouting thief and murderer at him.
And when they shout murder, I remember, yeah, I remember.
Assassino.
I'm just like, oh yeah, he did kill all those people.
Like what?
Four, five people now?
He just killed that random ass concierge, man.
He took him out.
Like, like, I'm sorry.
He laser targeted the hottest man in a business and killed him and dumped him into a sewer.
He was getting a fit off.
He killed him.
And she knows this too.
She knows he's like a multiple murderer and she's still like fucking Niagara down there
for this guy.
Like, you gotta get your fucking head examined, babes.
Anyway, Diabolic has refused a lawyer.
He's refused to say anything.
He has gone Vargas mode.
He does not eat.
He's gone non-verbal.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
He's easy.
Diabolic is an autistic king.
I would be pretty stressed out if I got arrested.
I might go non-verbal too.
Let's be honest.
He is blinking in a way that his comically shit public defender is like, this is a clear
sign of insanity.
But of course he is blinking in Morse code to Ava, who is extremely unsubtly like tapping
her own cheek to signal to him.
Yeah.
Not subtle.
He's fucking encoding a long message here as well.
This also relies on the premise that no one in that courtroom is looking at her and we
notice this.
It's like, no, I'm sorry.
Everyone in this courtroom is looking at her.
Have you seen this woman?
Someone later says of her, of this character, she is not a woman that goes unnoticed.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Which is a really, like, really good phrase, actually.
I'm also not a woman who goes unnoticed, but for bad reasons.
Brackets derogatory.
Yeah, exactly.
But so, essentially he is signaling to her, like, hey, here are the locations of all of
my secret hideouts.
I need you to go and get, like, X, Y, and Z from me.
But she doesn't go straight there.
No.
First, she presumably must go back to the hotel in order to change into a red dress with
white gloves and a tartan driving cape.
The white gloves make it look a bit Minnie Mouse.
You're gonna be driving.
True.
Yes, that's true.
Yeah.
She's a Minnie driver.
Mm-hmm.
Awful.
Awful.
The first Batcave that he sends her to just contains another Jaguar, which is just like
a nice present.
But then she goes to yet another Batcave where there's a big pile of cash and a secret lab
of colored vials and there's a plan being put in place.
Yeah.
But he's found guilty and sentenced to be fucking guillotined.
The Foley is so fucking funny at Diabolic Slayer.
Like, there are, like, cave water drip SFX in there.
What is happening?
He's a really bad builder.
The other thing that's really funny about the guillotine.
Well, there's two things that's funny about the gears.
Oh, yeah.
Sorry.
I did speak over that.
They're gonna kill Diabolic.
Yeah.
Good.
They're on the radio.
He's a murderer.
They're like, being like, they're gonna guillotine him.
And the radio's like...
The guillotine!
Well, that'll be a relief.
It's just like a kind of passing news item.
Like, well, it'll be cool we kill him.
Thank God for that.
They have to build the guillotine in the situation.
Like, they're hammering it together.
And I'm just like, a man has been sentenced to death in Lego City.
Build the guillotine.
Really great shot of him just, like, building the guillotine.
Oh my God.
No, but that's incredible.
A man has been sentenced to death in Lego City.
Doing the, like, fucking Lego Star Wars building noise.
I'm like...
But so, while he's Vargas mode in jail,
Eva has to go to Giorgio and seduce him into getting her into...
To see Diabolic.
I'm sorry, once again.
Cream coat, white gloves, salmon and white 60s top and skirt,
black croc skin bag, white nails,
and the tortoiseshell acetate oval sunglasses,
which are, like, very 60s,
and they also look a lot like what Dieter's women's wear range
is gonna be bringing out next year.
They are bringing out glasses which look very much like these.
Two sets, actually.
I met the designer when I was in LA.
My God, they're fucking gorgeous.
Oh!
So, her angle here, her angle of attack is...
Look out for those sunglasses coming out soon, socialists.
That's not what angle of attack means.
So her angle is...
It's pronounced socialites.
It's such a beautiful microcosm
of everything about the three of us in sequence there.
I love you so much.
What?
Really good.
What was a microcosm?
Oh, a microcosm.
You two arguing about the, like, ethics of acetate sunglasses
and me catching myself saying angle of attack
and then realizing that that's a technical term.
That's us, baby.
Fucking...
Her move here, her plan,
is to go,
only a guy with a massive penis,
who I would definitely get engaged to,
could get me in to see diabolic.
And if you couldn't do that,
well, maybe.
Maybe I don't even care.
You know, you could...
It's really funny that her sort of counter to the blackmailers,
go on then, fuck it.
Blackmail me.
I don't give a shit.
And he, like, instantly falls for this.
He's like, well, okay.
You can't blackmail me.
Everyone was doing it.
Previous Tory government.
She says to him,
I'm getting my pronouns fucked now by the subtitles.
She says to him,
it's not just about giving me money and power, Georgia.
You have to thrill me.
You have to excite me.
The thing that would excite me most of all
is meeting the legendary criminal diabolic
on the eve of his execution.
You know, what a unique experience that would be.
And he says, okay,
but I'm not going to let you go in there alone.
So they go to the prison.
She's changed into a brown hat, black top,
black leather knee-length coat.
Love it.
The leather, the texture on this leather.
Yeah, with, like, the hat brim pulled down low.
Gorgeous.
Looks like Carmen Sandiego, kind of.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And they say, oh, Ava's Secret Service.
We want to have a word with Diabolic
before he's executed.
National security, right?
And the manager's like, well, I mean, you could,
but he's not said a word since he was condemned.
He does not eat.
He does not drink.
He does not come.
He's completely passive.
I mean, I do the last two of those anyway.
They go into a room with him for 20 minutes.
We don't see it.
We just see a closed door and the clock moves
and then they walk out.
Simple as.
They take Diabolic to the guillotine.
They've just finished building.
It's one of those clocks that's sort of like,
it's not like a clock that moves around.
It's like the numbers like flap down.
Yeah.
And they just flap down real fast,
which I found to be very satisfying
for reasons I can't really put into words.
I love a flappy clock.
Yeah.
So yeah,
they take him out to the newly built guillotine.
They put him on the guillotine.
Long established I'm neurotypical.
And they fucking decaffeinate his ass.
They kill this boy.
Yeah.
They deconsecrate my boy.
They cut his fucking head off.
In this movie.
As the axe is falling,
Jinko is like.
Jinko puts it together.
It's like,
oh shit.
Wait,
wait a second.
Yeah,
because somebody says to Jinko,
like,
someone's like,
he's been silent for days,
catatonic,
almost weird.
It's almost like he's been drugged.
And then Jinko's like,
wait,
no,
what the fuck?
Oh shit.
They cut his head off.
They pull the mask off
and it's fucking Giorgio.
He's just been killed.
They cut his head off,
bitch.
This is pretty fucking horrifying,
right?
Yeah.
Like,
if you think about it,
that's some,
some Edgar Allan Poe shit.
You get like guillotine
while you're having like
locked in syndrome.
This is horrifying.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And we get a classic,
but this will be classic
to the heist genre
that we're moving into.
We get a little bit of like
flashback explaining
as we do it,
demontage.
You don't need,
this is the least earned
one of these
because you already kind of
know what's happened.
Yeah.
Obviously.
We're watching it
in a second language
and we know what's happened.
So they,
we see Ava mixing
the sort of drugs
in the Batcave
and then they inject
the real Giorgio,
drug him,
they give him
the truth serum
and he says,
by the way,
I have a whole bunch
of treasure.
Here's,
here's what the deal was
because I blackmailed
a whole bunch of like
pirates,
I guess,
or something.
Yeah.
They do a body swap
and then that's how
they did it.
And the Jinko says,
okay,
we need to lock this down.
Keep it a secret.
Diabolic and Ava
think they've gotten
away with it.
They're not going to know
that we're coming for them.
Sure.
Send,
send two cops to.
He would be so fucking
embarrassed if you just
cut the head off the,
like the finance minister.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Oh shit.
I don't know,
I'm looking at the
current cabinet and I'm like,
well,
yeah,
I guess we don't work for him.
Who's justice minister?
This is a key detail,
right?
They take,
Jinko takes four of his guys
who are with him at the
execution,
who have seen them
deconsecrate the vice
minister of justice.
And it's like,
two of you go to his house,
two of you go to his office.
Diabolic goes to the
minister's office in disguise
as the minister,
breaks open the safe,
takes a bunch of blackmail
material on Ava and dumps
the rest of it,
which is like blackmail
material on everybody else.
Just dumps it on the desk.
Yeah,
leaves and as he's leaving,
those two cops who have seen
with their own eyes
that the guy they have,
they have walking past
has been guillotined.
Mm-hmm.
They walk past him
like,
oh my God.
You hate to do a cinema
since,
Ding.
You hate to do it,
but they were in that scene.
He does hide his face.
A little,
but like,
that's,
you just saw this guy
get his head cut off.
Failed a perception check.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Goes into Hitman
Absolution instinct mode.
Mm-hmm.
Maybe it's like Clark Kent effect.
It's just like,
if you saw a guy
whose head you've just seen cut off,
you'd be like,
that guy looks a lot like
the guy who's had that.
Yeah,
but he can't be,
you know,
because it's ridiculous.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
So Ava is,
of course,
waiting for him outside
in the blackjack.
They get in,
they speed away.
The subtitles at this point say,
don't give up on the blow.
Not entirely sure
what that's about.
Something in Italian,
I think.
Yeah,
it's a golpo.
It's like a,
like a,
like a coup.
It's like a coup de main,
like a blow of force.
The thing,
right?
The thing.
And now,
listeners,
you may remember
from the last Diabolic movie we did,
because this might,
this could be like
the end of the movie,
like they drive away music,
da da da da da,
right?
No.
But you might remember
from the last Diabolic movie,
no,
there was another,
we get another like
half a movie,
because time for some
11th hour treasure antics.
This should have been TV,
or it should have been the sequel,
because like,
this is where we start
the second movie,
an hour and a half
into the first movie.
Yep.
Which I like,
it's like a little,
you know,
an extra present from the kitchen
when you get like
an extra dessert,
like.
It's like the death
from above level
in Modern Warfare.
It's not just that
they've teamed up,
you know,
we're getting their first heist
that they work together on
as well,
right?
Yeah,
true.
So,
fine.
Giorgio had a bunch of
treasure hidden somewhere
that he blackmailed
from various people.
In a vault.
Yeah,
we don't know where yet though.
So,
Jinko interrogates
the secretary
and finds that like
she,
she knew something about
that she was hiding
the other blackmail files.
Like,
she's got some information.
Diabolic knows where it is
because he's used
the truth serum on the guy
and who is just like,
it's in the like
central bank of Genf
or whatever.
Yeah.
And so,
Jinko has to figure this out
and like follow
Diabolic's steps.
Yeah.
Meanwhile,
a lady,
a very sexy older lady
turns up at the central bank
of Genf
in a white and cream fit
with romboid frames,
pearl earrings.
Very nice.
Yeah.
Different sunglasses this time.
And I become one of those people
who like is obsessed
with the idea
that everyone in public
is like secretly trans
because I'm like,
that's,
that's Ava.
That's,
now that you've introduced
the idea of like latex masks,
everybody's fucking doing it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And so the bank,
she turns up at the bank
with some valuable paintings
and under the guise of like,
I'm a wealthy woman
who's putting some paintings
in your vaults
and the bank manager
explains the vault security system.
I'd love for a wealthy woman
to put some paintings
in my vaults.
I do like that the bank manager
is a woman.
I do too.
It's nice that women
can have jobs
that aren't just like
you're very sexy
or a bank robber.
They do the thing
where they explain
like how secure the vault is
and they do the thing
where they show you
the blueprints of the vault
but one of them is,
one like slide of this
functionally is explaining
what a cube is
and I really like that.
Yeah.
Well, of course,
comics, 2D medium,
difficult to...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's like a square
but it's like, you know...
We do get a nice bit of,
I'm glad they left this in
unless the movie
would have cut this out,
is as Jinko is on the trail,
he talks to one of the other
blackmail victims
and he says,
oh yeah,
I was being blackmailed
by the vice minister of justice
because there's some photos of me
and Jinko just goes,
here they are
and gives them back.
So we get a nice bit of like,
Jinko was a good man.
Yeah.
Nice.
I like that.
It's cute.
Yeah.
And he figures it out
and he has to like,
you know, run down to Genf
with his boys
because he can't call ahead
and like tip them off.
And so Diabolic
is going to break into this fault
and his plan is just
to leave Eva behind.
Yeah.
And she's like,
well, what the fuck is this?
Like, because it's 2021,
even in Italy,
feminism has been invented.
And so...
It's 2021, 1961.
Yeah.
So she gets to be like,
what, and I'm just going to
like do nothing,
like cook your meals for you
or whatever.
She brings him tea
while he's preparing
his evil schemes,
which I think is quite sweet.
That is kind of cool.
Yeah.
And he's like,
no, it's fine.
My evil plan is,
it's pretty simple, actually.
He's going to like do surgery
on a wall.
He's going to like,
the painting containers
have a laser in them
that's going to laser out
the front of the wall.
He's going to drill through the wall.
He's going to flood
the entire vault,
standing in it
for like two and a half hours
waiting for it to flood.
And then he's just going to swim in.
Short circuit the alarms
and scuba my way inside.
And it's like, great.
Cool.
Hell yeah.
Sick.
Love it.
You said he used scuba
as a verb.
So, yeah.
And he does.
It's really funny,
him just standing there
for two and a half hours
while Jinko is outside
with the firefighters
and the security guards
just being like...
He's just like playing games
on his phone.
He's got Bellatro
on mobile now.
He's doing Wordle.
Sick.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's doing Absurdle.
The adversarial Wordle.
You've got to stop
playing for your New York Times
crossword.
Yes, yes you do.
You've got to stop.
You've got to try
some other
non-New York Times dolls.
They call them the dolls
but they're anything but.
Yeah.
So he scoobas into the vault.
I do also want to talk
about the firefighters
in this, right?
Because these firefighters
are an incredible bunch
of lads.
A bunch of very burly
mustachioed men
all wearing ankle length
leather trench coats.
And their boss,
boss firefighter,
has an even longer
moustache and is wearing
a bunch of like
metal ribbons
on his leather trench coat.
And I'm just like,
this is an aesthetic
you guys have got here.
You got those in the fire wars.
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess so.
I mean, 60s Italy,
question mark.
You got them in the
something wars.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, don't worry about it.
So Ava is watching
all this in binoculars
and she sees the backup
arriving.
Jinko is preparing a trap
and she's like,
oh, no, well,
I'm not just going to
stay at home.
So she jumps in the Jaguar.
She encounters a roadblock
where she gets recognized
and then she like
kills four cops.
Yes, she does.
Yeah.
Yep, yep, yep.
Just kills four.
Without remorse.
With some kind of like
throwing knife dart thing.
Just kills four men.
So from zero kills to four.
I don't know.
She's an aristocratic lady.
She's probably killed before.
Her husband,
it's kind of implied.
I guess.
I guess.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Not seen a high U score before.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hardest ones to get.
Yeah, for sure.
And just as Diabolic's
about to get away,
Jinko shoots him in the shoulder
and makes him remove his mask.
Diabolic has killed
three cops on the way out
unprovoked.
He has done the knife cam
thing again
into like
the backs of
three cops
and the front of a third one.
So when
Jinko shoots him,
it's a little like
you shot me.
It's like,
yeah, also,
you did kill
three people
like just now.
He shoots him non-fatally
and they debate the law.
Jinko's just like,
I will guard civilization.
They do that same thing
that they did at the end
of that Jackie Chan movie
where they just like,
no,
crime is not the way.
Civilization requires law
and order.
And he's like,
I can't.
My dick's too big.
I'm too cool.
I live outside the law.
Diabolic and his massive dick
back up a bit,
causing Jinko to step forward.
And Eva,
who is climbing up
the ladder of the dock
to take a long swing
with an oar
of all things.
And I lied
when I said
I didn't have drops from this.
I have one drop from this
because it's too funny not to.
That's it.
She just hits him
really hard in the legs
and he just falls down
like he's been shot.
And Diabolic banks
on the fact,
Diabolic banks on the fact
that Jinko won't shoot him dead.
And Jinko's like,
yeah, you're right.
I won't
because I fucking,
I follow the rules
and I obey the law.
I'm not going to kill you
in cold blood.
Even though you have done that
like seven or eight times.
And then Diabolic gets the gun
and it looks like
he's going to execute Jinko,
but he doesn't.
He lets him go.
Eva doesn't say shit,
by the way.
She doesn't try and stop him
or anything.
She's fine with it.
She's right or die.
She's like,
please kill him.
She's like,
I'm so close.
Please kill him.
Yeah, no.
Eva's a real true believer.
That's the thing.
Yeah, Diabolic's got a little remote.
And this is a case of the kind of like
corollary to Zenogartification,
right?
Luponification,
which is absolutely
you find that you are the nemesis
and you can't bring yourself
to really like,
you know,
because if you just kill him,
that's not satisfying.
It's not a nemesis situation.
This is another guy you killed.
You know?
Yeah, exactly.
This guy's widow's peak
is like too pointy to kill him.
So they sail away on a yacht.
Eva at this point
is wearing just a white bikini,
which is very similar
to a real bikini I have actually.
And the oval acetate frames.
And then Diabolic says,
I got something for you.
I found it in the vault
from that guy I decapitated.
One of the many people
you and I have murdered
in the three days
we've known each other.
It's like natural born killers
in this bitch.
It's terrible.
Yeah.
I had this
and it's the real
pink diamond ring.
And she throws it overboard.
I thought this was sweet.
I don't need it.
It symbolizes my past.
And what symbolizes
my future is you.
Aww.
Multiple murderer.
Yeah.
And we get the
fucked hair.
The ending text
that is always funny
in Italian
where it says
the end
but it says in Italian
which reads in English as
fine.
Yeah.
The movie's over
and you're like
alright.
Yeah.
Thanks for coming.
I quite liked this film.
I've really liked it.
I've enjoyed it.
It has a stab
at the idea
that Diabolic
is not a good person.
And it has a stab
at the idea
of like feminism
as well.
Right.
And not hugely
successfully
like the daylight
between Diabolic
and Georgiou
is that Georgiou
is a blackmailer
whereas Diabolic
is the far more
preferable murderer
and merely gaslights
his own wife
who he doesn't love.
Hmm.
Who by the way
disappears from the film.
Oh yeah.
She's done.
She's done.
She's done.
She's out of here.
He just disappears from her.
Hopefully she's doing alright.
Jinko has her sedated
when he gets there.
It's like literally
the first thing he says
when he's out of the car
is like sedate that woman.
And it's like
1960s.
Oh Jesus.
Put her somewhere.
Yeah.
It reminded me tonally
quite a lot of the
modern man from Uncle film.
Interesting.
And it's like
sexy spy
period shit
it's happening.
Yeah I guess so.
I see.
And I think
like the man from Uncle
it does
kind of like
it's a bit hamstrung
by
the conventions
of the like
thing that it's from.
You know.
Italian guy Richie
or ragazzo Richie.
Ragazzo Rico.
Yeah.
No.
I enjoyed this film.
Would have enjoyed
a lot more
in a higher resolution
with better subtitles
but you know.
Yeah.
No as I said
great movie.
I wish I knew
what anyone said.
I think unlike
the man from Uncle
and even unlike
James Bond
this film understands
like yes
this is a very
male driven story
and yes it's
kind of like
boysy
but the way
that you make it
the way that you
make it for women
and for girls
and for wams
and femoids
is you give
your leading lady
a series of
astonishing fits.
Yes.
You just put so much
thought and effort
into her fits
that I'm like
okay there's something
here for me
like I'm still enjoying it.
In some ways
like you might suggest
that that was
like internalized
misogyny
or just regular
misogyny
from the movie
but it's way
preferable to something
that the man from
Uncle does
which is like
she's a girl boss
this movie also does
that but it doesn't
put the like
lampshade on it
it doesn't be like
it's you know
I mean maybe
it's different
because you're
watching it
in another language
and like you know
but it doesn't seem
to like put the
emphasis on like
and Ava's like
kicking ass
it's just something
that she does.
Yeah it's nice.
And also like
her fits
it's female gaze
it's female gaze
shit.
It's not like
oh the outfits
are really sexy
or whatever.
No it's still not
actually a lot of them
on.
It's just that
real fucking nice.
Yeah.
As someone who
couldn't hear
anything that was
said throughout
the entire movie
basically I've been
thinking largely
about like
short composition
and like the way
the cameras move
and also
as a result
of the
completely legal
website that I'm
using at this
present moment
to just scrub
through the movie
right now
it does this
thing where
when you pause
it it goes
black and white
and I've just
been scrubbing
through and this
movie looks
beautiful in black
and white.
It works
perfectly.
I'm not even
joking do a
re-release.
Genuinely.
The color grading
is not bad at all
but like it really
benefits from black
and white I think.
It absolutely
pops off her.
Yeah.
This is
I enjoyed this one
and they made
I love this movie.
They made two
sequels.
Yeah.
Which we'll also
see.
If we can find
them maybe
maybe we can
hire fucking
whatever the next
two are called.
Surely they would
have come out
like just now.
Yeah.
We've got to be
able to find them.
You would think
2022 and 2023
they were doing
one of these a year
which is like a
great work right.
Keep going.
This is what I want
from like any
movie intellectual property.
Holy shit.
What's up?
Guess how much
this movie cost to make.
Like $60.
More than that.
I don't know.
Five mil.
It only cost
10 million euros.
God damn.
That's dead cheap.
That's like 11
million dollars.
Like this looks
so good for
11 million dollars.
It really does.
Yeah.
And they do a lot
of practical shit.
It wasn't on the
outfit.
Oh it's because
you filmed it
in Italy.
That's like yeah
okay.
Yeah.
That's yeah.
Yeah.
90% of budget
went to costumes
and the rest of it
still holds up.
It's wild.
Yeah.
But we don't
have to.
A period piece
as well for 11
million.
God.
Italians.
What a secret.
The 60s cars.
We don't have to
not quantify this
stuff because we
have a science
based system.
Yes.
Scum.
Scum.
It's called
the scum system.
It stands for
smarm cultural
insensitivity
unprovoked violence
and misogyny.
On a scale of
zero to seven
how smarmy
is diabolic
brackets 2021?
The line that
stands out to me
is that you
wouldn't need a
diamond to be
cunty.
Also he's in
disguise as other
guys talking about
how cool he is
constantly.
Yeah.
Unbelievably smarmy
from him.
I'm going to put a
marker down here for
heist season.
I think that the
gentleman thief,
the kind of cat
burglar is an
inherently smarmy
archetype.
Very smarmy.
You're starting
from a kind of
high tariff,
you know?
I don't know.
I think it's like
a four maybe
or a five.
Easily put it
at five.
Like genuinely.
Yeah.
The kind of like
anyone could be
diabolic waggles
eyebrows thing
is pretty fucking
smarmy.
Yeah.
And he is very
pleased with himself
in that moment.
Yeah.
Alright.
Five?
Five.
Cultural
insensitivity.
The only non-white
people are two
security guards in
the hotel.
True.
Who are filmed
together.
Not sure what the
significance of that
is or if we're
meant to like,
I don't know,
for all I know
they're like,
you know,
famous in themselves
but I don't know.
Yeah,
no,
exactly.
We can only rig on
what we know
which is that
omission is what
this is.
Is at least two,
yeah.
Is at least two.
Yeah.
It has the same
thing as,
it's weirdly,
I mentioned
Porca Rosso earlier
and I mentioned
Italy as a
fictional country.
That's not just
me pulling
something out
of my ass,
that's something
that's been
written about
about like,
a lot of
Japanese art,
right,
is like,
taking Europe
as this kind
of like,
fantasy,
like,
continent where
nothing bad
really happens
and,
you know,
it has this
kind of
beautiful,
like,
context to it.
Occidentalism?
Kind of,
yeah.
Hmm,
okay.
Wakon Yosei,
Western Learning,
it's a Japanese
spirit,
Western Learning,
a tendency
since the Meiji
period for Japanese
artists to paint
Europe as spectacular
or simultaneously
maintaining the
distance necessary
to preserve a
distinct sense of
Japanese identity.
Well,
this by accident-
Like Howl's
Moving Castle?
Yeah,
exactly.
Arrives in a
similar place,
albeit coming from
Italy,
of being like,
this is set in
comic book land.
It's not set in
Italy,
it's set in
Clairville,
which is nowhere,
it's kind of
Switzerland,
kind of Italy.
It's set in a
60s that doesn't
have the,
like,
years of lead
in it,
you know?
Yeah,
that's true.
It's this kind
of,
like,
nice period
piece,
in the same way
that we might
do in this
country with
fucking,
I don't know,
Midsummer Murders
or whatever.
Yes,
definitely.
Castle of
Caleostro was
set in a
similarly fictional
European country,
wasn't it?
Yeah,
and I'm not
against that in
itself.
I love,
I love Porco
Rosso,
for instance,
but like,
is that culturally
insensitive?
I'm not sure,
I don't know
that I would
necessarily describe
it that way,
but it's,
I think it's an
interesting discussion
to fold into that.
Yeah,
this kind of,
like,
fantasy version
of Europe,
this,
like,
Swissitalia
monostria,
do you want to
bump it up by one
for that?
We could give it
three.
Yeah,
I'll go three,
comfortably three.
Unprovoked
violence is where
it's going to do
very badly.
It's going to be
pretty fucking high
from both of our
leads.
Yeah,
no,
because he's
just killing
guys.
Yeah,
I would have
liked it more
if they'd used
the man from
Uncle Gass's.
Yeah,
both the murder,
I mean,
both the murder
cops,
right,
which at least
you can say,
like,
cops are volunteering
to get killed
first,
but,
like,
Diabolic kills
a guy for getting
a fit off.
He,
like,
yeah,
that is a murder.
It's very much
established for
Diabolic.
He has a bunch
of faces in his
basement that he
doesn't use in
this,
and it's,
like,
pretty clear that
those are all
just other guys
that he's killed.
Something else I
like is that in
the kind of
establishing bit
where he's
recording him,
this is an
opportunity to
make the guy
really unlikable,
so that you go,
oh,
Diabolic's killed
that guy,
but,
you know,
we don't feel
that bad about it.
But they don't,
at least not that I
could detect.
He's just like,
he may be a bit
of a braggart,
but he's like a
totally normal guy
who then gets,
like,
knifed in the back
and dumped down a
sewer,
and I like that they
don't take the
opportunity to take
an easy out,
you know?
Six?
Yeah,
I think we could do
six.
I think we're saving
seven for,
like,
a kind of a mass
casualty event,
maybe,
or like an unusually
sadistic murder,
but like,
six for just a kind
of,
like,
instrumental murder,
a murder to get a
guy out of the way
so you can take his
identity,
six.
Yeah,
definitely.
And misogyny.
This is a difficult
one,
right?
because we kind
of engage with
the concept of
misogyny when
Eva is like,
I don't want to
just do nothing,
and indeed she has
to save him.
Diabolic doesn't
really appear to
learn a lesson from
this or anything.
It's very true.
And it's just kind
of assumed.
We do see that
Diabolic's,
like,
heteronormative
cover lifestyle
is deeply toxic
and,
like,
sadomasochistic.
Yeah.
However...
We never really get
into that either.
No.
It's never just like,
I feel bad about
the way I'm treating
her.
It's just like,
I don't love her,
I'm going to leave
her some money
and fuck off.
Yeah,
exactly.
Which also,
we don't see him
make good on that
promise.
No,
no.
If I was Ava,
I'd be like,
uh,
I think you should
treat your wife
well.
Like,
yeah,
just be nice.
It's really
interesting because
there are a few
things where they
make Diabolic an
anti-hero,
right?
But they don't
really engage
with anything
downstream of that.
We see him,
like,
gaslight his wife
and then kind of
the anti-hero.
He still gets away
with it and was
still kind of
meant to root for him.
Because I guess
the gentleman thief
is supposed to be
daring,
right?
That's the fantasy.
It's like somebody
who dares.
And it's just like,
there are some
things that it would
be like exciting
and thrilling to
dare to do,
to like tweak the
nose of authority
or redistribute wealth
or, you know,
take a very luxurious
lifestyle.
And there are some
things that you
should not dare to
do, such as like
threaten women.
Yeah.
I mean,
even within that,
there are different
like shades of that.
Like they're kind of
knife point seduction
thing is a lot
more comfortable
than the way he
treats his wife,
for instance.
Yes.
Not least because it
gives her agency as
well.
Mm-hmm.
And I think the fact
that the movie
contains both
leaves me not quite
sure where to put it.
I don't really know
what to make of this one.
Yeah, it's a bit of a
clash from scene to
scene actually.
Yeah.
Four or maybe more?
I, hmm.
It could have been worse.
Also, I think the fact
that the bank manager
is a lady is just like,
here's just a normal
woman doing a job.
Yeah, certainly.
Yeah.
She's not sexualized,
she's not objectified,
she's just a professional
doing a job, but I'm
like, okay.
The, the like minister's
secretary has kind of
her own agency and
stuff.
Yeah.
And has her own like
interiority.
Yes.
I think the fact that it
doesn't explicitly judge
Diabolic for any of the
like horrible stuff that
he does and just leaves
you to sit with it is
it's a weakness in the
movie in some ways,
but I, I, I think it
does kind of compensate.
Right.
I think four all makes
sense.
Yeah.
Cool.
Okay.
So that gives it a total
score of 18.
That's not bad.
Yeah.
It's pretty good.
I'm trying to compare
it now to, so the, the
2015 man from uncle,
which I said it reminded
me of, got a 20.
Um, so this is a
better movie objectively
then.
Yeah, it is.
Um, it's also like less
than a lot of Euro
spies that we've done.
Oh, certainly.
They filed off a lot of
the more toxic.
So how does it compare
to, to the sixties one
danger Diabolic?
Do you have that in
front of you?
Uh, yes, I do.
Give me one second
here.
That got exactly the
same 18.
It's a perfect remake
then.
Yeah.
Shot for shot.
It's, it's absolutely
identical in, in ethics.
That also was more
misogynistic and had
more unprovoked
violence.
Huh?
Well, I mean, we take
those, you know?
Yeah, absolutely.
Bam.
That was diabolic.
We got two more of
these if we can find
them.
And this is going to be
the bridge into robbery
season, which is going to
start after that directly.
Mm hmm.
In the meantime, we have a
Patreon.
You can subscribe to it.
And if you do the next
bonus episode, it's going
to be my pick.
Hell yes.
A little film by the
name of the People's
Joker.
We've been fucking nailing
it with the bonuses
recently, folks.
Yeah.
Not to put my finger on
the scale here, but,
you know, even just pay
for one month and listen
to the backlog, man.
There's some good stuff
in there.
Yeah, I'm excited for
this one because it's
one of my favorite
movies that I've seen
recently.
Maybe one of my
favorite movies.
And I think it's also
one that I'm probably
going to get into
like oversharing about.
So if you want to, if
you want to get
some some lore, you
know, check out that
episode.
But in the meantime, it
only remains for me to
say thank you so much
for listening.
We will see you next
time.
Bye, everyone.
