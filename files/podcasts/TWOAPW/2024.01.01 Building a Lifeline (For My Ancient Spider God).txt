And you may find yourself standing in the Egyptian desert.
And you may find yourself taking out a sizable loan.
And you may find yourself in charge of a multifaceted construction project.
And you may find yourself in Egyptian court with a cease and desist.
And you may tell them all, well, what can you do?
Praise be to Shea, go by. Let the spiders all rain down.
Oh, the great Shea, go by. Let them flow up from the ground.
Building a ziggurat next to the Nile's waters.
Building a lifeline for my ancient spider god.
And you may find yourself still in that same courtroom.
And you may hear them asking, do you have the right permits?
And you may answer back, I didn't realize I needed them.
And they will grimly nod. Yeah, you kinda do.
Filling out paperwork.
Form 2A in duplicate.
Filling out paperwork.
Trying not to throw a fit.
Building a ziggurat.
Next to the Nile's waters.
You'll need a lifeline.
Or in paperwork, you'll drown.
You must initial here.
You must initial here.
You must initial here.
You must initial here.
You must initial here.
Don't forget to initial here.
You must initial here.
You must initial here.
Let's talk about zoning. Can't forget about zoning.
Cause there is water flooding the foundation.
Remove the water. There's just more water.
Removing the water from the base of the structure.
Mourning the employees. All that water made them drown.
Dodging the employment fees means the union's coming down into the red again.
After that money's gone, take out a banking loan for that water underground.
Praise be to Shea, go buy. Who will be worth the interest rate?
So only Shea, go buy. This fighter tempo will be great.
Into the web again. After you've trapped us all.
A sticky lifeline in our gooey holy gowns.
You may ask yourself, why am I trapped in the web?
You may ask yourself, how many spiders is too many?
And you may ask yourself, are we people or are we food?
And you may scream to yourself, my god, what have I done?
Letting her read your brain as her webbings are unfurled.
Letting me take the blame as she takes over the world.
Building the ziggurat next to the Nihil's waters was such a huge mistake.
God, someone save me from myself.
Unleashing Shea, go buy. Oh my god, she's got Japan.
Fear the great Shea, go buy.
She'll devour every man into the shit again.
After the world's devoured, throw us a lifeline.
So we can begin again.
Oh god!
Oh, I'm so bad, you spiders!
Oh!
Oh, why did I do this?
Oh, oh.
Oh!
Oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
cetteFan schon.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh.
