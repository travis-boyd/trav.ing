On this season, we'll be covering our vehicles of hysteria, how pop culture and the media
shape our psychology and society, and how our national mythologies manipulate the realities
we share, and sometimes the realities we don't.
I'm your host, Chelsea Weber-Smith, and this is American Hysteria.
The articles claim that when Herschel pointed the telescope at the moon, he saw a beautiful,
colorful world.
No, not you.
Your organization's terrible.
Your organization's terrible.
Let's go.
I'm not going to give you a question.
You are fake news.
Go ahead.

Over Hillary.
That was all a cocktail of headlines from our conspiracy industrial complex.
Fox News, Breitbart, Infowars, The National Enquirer, and also its satirical counterpart,
the Weekly World News.
Some of these outlets claim to reveal the repressed truths in political news,
and others are more lighthearted or sardonic jabs at the gullibility of Americans.
But here in the smoky fever dream of 2020, can you even tell the difference anymore?
Fake news was the unofficial top buzzword of 2016.
And in fact, it was Collins Dictionary Term of the Year in 2017.
As false stories spread like wildfire across tabloids, TV news,
with fringe online talking heads, message boards, social media,
it all traveled prolifically, fueled in large part by the Trump administration,
who used this opportunity to begin constructing an entire alternate reality.
Some of what we're talking about today are early American hoaxes that duped the public in fanciful ways,
like the early reports of giants found hidden underground and bat people living on the moon.
Stories that in retrospect read like the headlines of the meta-tabloid,
the weekly world news, alongside alien politician love affairs.
But we'll also see how this model of sensational stories quickly took off with the penny press,
a flashy and smoldering rebuttal to the boring liberal elitism of outlets like the New York Times,
and a far more lucrative one as well.
We'll look at the history of disinformation and atrocity propaganda,
and how its sinister world has found its modern voice,
leveraged through politicians and the media,
hitting at the most reactionary of our emotions,
with the most bloodthirsty of villains.
We know that our society is drawn to capital letters telling us what to be afraid of,
what current cultural phantom to fear.
Our legacy is that of grinning fantastical thinkers and frothing doomsayers.
And it's all in the name of the truth.
Way back in August of 1835,
a fledgling daily paper called the New York Sun
was making waves as one of America's first penny papers,
covering stories of public interest rather than the boring financial and political reports of the day.
These papers, like the New York Times,
were too expensive for the working class to afford
and often contained content that just didn't relate to their lives.
And so the penny press filled the gap,
focusing instead on entertainment and leaving the political humdrum out of it.
True crime proved a popular topic, of course,
but soon editors realized that other kinds of stories sold just as well.
The kind of stories that seemed to pique our interest in a similar vein to murder.
Stories of the strange and unusual,
the paranormal,
freak oddities like P.T. Barnum used to display,
sheep with three eyes and snakes with two heads.
But the Sun gained its first real burst of notoriety
when the paper published a six-part series called Celestial Discoveries
that would come to be known as the Great Moon Hoax.
The articles alleged, in a serious scientific manner,
that the moon was teeming with advanced life
and offered drawings of what had apparently been discovered
by the famous astronomer Sir John Herschel,
with a completely made-up telescope of unimaginable power.
And allegedly, and we must include this,
as the creation was completed,
a scientist reportedly said to Herschel,
Thou art the man!
Over a period of six days,
conveniently following America's first sighting of Halley's Comet,
they rolled the story out in a sensational fashion
to a wild buzz,
with newsboys hollering cinematically on the street corners
about this revolutionary discovery.
It went like this.
The moon was not the lonely hanging rock that America knew,
but instead, it was full of familiar sights,
rivers, lakes, even oceans with sandy beaches,
huge temples of beautiful blue stone with golden roofs,
even one that was abandoned and perpetually surrounded by flames,
with a scattering of familiar-looking pyramids.
And then there was the wildlife,
miniature zebras and bison,
beavers that walked like people and made huts
and were able to build fires,
and even large blue goat-like unicorns.
The advanced beings of the moon were referred to as man-bats
and were just that,
a hybrid of a man and a bat,
mostly like real hard-bodied, hairy men with bat wings.
And these creatures mated publicly without modesty
and appeared to be conscious and sentient,
and also vegetarians.
After the first installment,
the sun's readership increased two-and-a-half-fold
and would become the most widely read in the entire world.
And this wasn't just a fun paranormal rabbit hole
for a handful of people to go down for an afternoon.
Though it's difficult to ascertain the scope of the belief
in this goofy tale,
there is evidence to suggest that
a truly notable number of readers took it to be true.
In Kurt Anderson's book Fantasyland,
he quotes an editor, perhaps speaking a little hyperbolically,
of a different local newspaper.
All New York rang with the wonderful discoveries.
To express a doubt on the genuineness
of the great lunar discoveries
was considered almost as heinous a sin
as to question the truth of revelation.
In classic fashion,
the next step was the grand expose,
the fraud revealed.
At the time,
the sun's greatest competitor
was James Gordon Bennett's New York Herald,
a publication that would have likely been able
to skewer the moon story faster
had its offices not burned to the ground
the very week of the story's premiere.
But by the end of the month,
the Herald found the vital comeback it needed
in a lengthy article titled
The Astronomical Hoax Explained,
in which the sun editor,
Richard Adams Locke,
one of the industry's first beat crime journalists,
was revealed as the author
and called out for creating a hysteria
with his fake news.
There would be reports years later
that Locke was actually a satirist
who was basically making fun
of some of the loonier scientific assertions of the day,
especially those made by the man he called
the Christian Philosopher,
who claimed that there were billions of inhabitants
living on the moon.
There were people out there talking seriously
on the matter of moon people,
and then there were the people making fun of that as well.
And it reminds me of a Puritan story
that also made a serious splash
in the boredom of colonial America.
The Nephilim were on the earth in those days,
and also afterward,
when the sons of God went to the daughters of men
and had children by them.
They were the heroes of old,
men of renown.
So the Lord said,
I will wipe mankind whom I have created
from the face of the earth,
men and animals,
and creatures that move along the ground,
and birds of the air,
for I am grieved that I have made them.
In 1705,
in a small town in New York
called Claverack
that was set along the Hudson River,
the story goes like this.
On a leisurely stroll,
a Dutch farmer felt something like a rock
knock against his boot,
something that had been rolling down the hill beside him.
And when he picked it up to examine it,
he was flabbergasted
to realize he was holding a tooth
the size of his fist.
But without hesitation,
he traded the tooth to a local politician
for a glass of rum straight up.
The tooth was then gifted to Lord Cornbury,
the quirky and flamboyant governor of the state,
who made a big old to-do about it all,
and through digging in the area,
more huge bones would be discovered.
But without even the notion
that the earth could have been
more than 6,000 God-fearing years old,
they wouldn't have guessed
that it was actually an extinct species.
Well, at least, not a biological one.
Perhaps out of an actual belief,
and perhaps out of a beneficial political agenda,
or both,
Lord Cornbury wrote on a slip of paper,
tooth of a giant,
just below the passage of Genesis
that stated, approximately,
there were giants in the earth
in the days before the flood.
At the time,
it was a serious flex against their British rivals
that America would be the true home
of these biblical beefcakes.
Oh, and here he comes.
Watch out.
You think you wouldn't slime in
for a piece of the action?
That's right.
Puritan minister and witch trial bitch
Cotton Mather was there
to pridefully boast about the bones,
and said that,
compared to the American supergiants,
European giants,
must hardly be so much as pygmies.
But then the more liberal side of the spectrum
got in on that fake news action
150 years later,
as the popular myth was still hanging around,
despite scientific refutations,
with one atheist all puffed up
about these ridiculous claims.
After getting in a yelling fight
with a reverend,
George Hull thought it was time
to punk the delusional revivalists,
as he sat, quote,
wondering why people would believe
those remarkable stories
in the Bible about giants,
when suddenly I thought of making a stone giant
and passing it off as a petrified man.
The finished giant had been made from quarry rock,
allegedly for a statue of Lincoln,
and Hull hired a stone cutter
to sculpt a 3,000-pound hoax,
spending the equivalent of $50,000,
and then he buried it in Cardiff, New York,
left it there for a year for authenticity,
and then hired people to discover it
while digging a well.
He swore them to secrecy.
Thousands poured into Cardiff
to get a glimpse of what the papers
were calling a new wonder.
After making some cash on tickets,
Hull sold the giant,
and it went on the road with its new owner.
But within a few months,
people began realizing it was all fake,
a hoax to expose the ridiculousness
of the Christian version of science,
and also to make a bunch of cash at the same time.
P.T. Barnum would go on to copy the Cardiff giant,
and it would influence his weekly world newsian oddities
as he spreads similar stories all over the country,
continuing to prop up the American idea
that anything and everything is possible,
and often preferable, to everyday life.
In a world where anything is possible,
it opens a dangerous space
for far more concerted disinformation campaigns,
ones not pushed by flim-flam artists
out to make a buck,
but those that are specifically created
to inflame a different kind of emotion,
a far less dreamy fantasy of moon paradises
and self-important giant bones.
This thing called atrocity propaganda
is the blood of this kind of political disinformation,
and this type of conspiracy can be found
to motivate the public in support of war,
whether literal or cultural.
As an early example,
Benjamin Franklin often used rhetoric
as a means of swaying public opinion,
and he went so far as to create a conspiracy
of exaggerated, bloodthirsty bands
of Seneca chiefs who were conspiring
with British King George III,
who was working to, quote,
engage savages to murder defenseless farmers,
women, and children.
Now, it was true that some tribes
had allied with the British
during the Revolutionary War
to fight against the colonists,
but the extremely monstrous story
that Franklin would spin
was made in hopes to sway British popular opinion
in favor of the peace treaties
he hoped to finalize
with America's former motherland.
In 1782, he would write
a supplement to the British Independent Chronicle,
a fake letter supposedly written
by a British agent named James Crawford,
addressed to the governor of Canada
with a little extra surprise gift
of hundreds of patriot scalps.
Another made-up letter
from another made-up guy
from the New England militia
added more authenticity.
A man who allegedly stole that gift
before it arrived to expose it all
and described in detail
the horrors he discovered.
Prisoners burnt alive after being scalped,
their nails pulled out by the roots,
enclosed were 102 scalps of farmers,
88 scalps torn from women,
193 from boys,
211 from girls,
and 29 infants that were, quote,
ripped out of their mother's bellies.
30 years later,
the story found a second life
when it was dug up and reproduced
in papers all over the country
during the War of 1812,
when we were back at it
with the British again,
and they were gaining ground
with the help of various tribes.
And the scalp present story
reappeared as evidence
of the salacious,
bloody conspiracy
against the good white rural patriots
who were just trying
to manifest their destiny.
Approaching the turn
of the 20th century
with the constant popularity
of true crime in mind,
a serious sex and gore war
was fought by two of the most famous
American publishers of all time,
Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst,
the pioneers of what would come
to be called yellow journalism,
an early relative of the tabloids.
In 1884, Pulitzer purchased
the New York world
and then vastly increased
its circulation.
And the next year,
Hearst would do the same
with the New York Journal American,
both penny papers
that were available
to the working class.
Prior to the Spanish-American War
of 1898,
their papers wrote
false stories
of women strip-searched
and sexually harassed
and assaulted
by Spanish officials
within the boundaries
of America.
There were brutal executions
and starving women
and children.
It became a well-known legend
that Hearst's headlines
sparked the Spanish-American War
of 1898,
but that's an exaggeration.
However,
the paper certainly had
a serious effect
on public perception.
And with its aggressively
patriotic tone,
it got America
to rally behind the flag
again and again,
to rally against
that enemy from without,
but also the enemy
from within.
By the early 1930s,
Hearst was,
to put it bluntly,
a pre-Nazi
or a fascist,
one who would publish letters
in his journal
penned by Adolf Hitler,
whom he repeatedly praised
for his strong stance
against communism,
that specter of indoctrination
and radicalization
that was complete
with the Jewish
Illuminati conspiracies
that Henry Ford
was spreading
through the hoax document,
The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.
Now,
we've talked about this document a lot,
especially in our episode
on the Illuminati,
so please revisit that
if you'd like to.
This document acted
as a kind of proof
that there was a
concerted Jewish effort
to take over the world
and that the arms
of this evil cabal
reached into all parts
of our social structure,
Hollywood,
academia,
the government,
the media,
you name it.
He ramped up
his frothing patriotism
when he placed
America first
in all caps
at the top of his newspaper,
above an eagle
with a ribbon
in his talons
that read,
An American Paper
for the American People.
All caps.
Hearst published
paranoid but familiar stories
about communists
controlling universities
who were teaching
alien doctrines
and the communist
radical influence
on unionizing workers
that would culminate
in a very familiar
kind of mass protest
and a very familiar
response to it.
Here are the first pictures
of strike-paralyzed
San Francisco
in the grip
of a general labor tie-up
to the possibility
of mob violence
is added fear
of pestilence.
I must insist
first
that law and order
shall prevail.
Workers across racial lines
would unite
in a general strike
in San Francisco
in the summer of 1934.
As Hearst whipped up panic
about these alleged
communist and anarchist
insurrectionists
through false
conspiracy theories,
a considerable number
of patriots
took it very seriously
and came out
and responded
as vigilantes
in tandem
with the police
setting fires
and destroying property
and beating up tradesmen
whether they were
protesters or not.
Dozens were arrested
during the riots
but none of them
were the vigilantes
who were out
beating up
innocent citizens.
What did Hearst
print the next day?
Can you guess?
Thank God
the patriotic citizens
of California
have shown us the way.
The New York Times
had been around
several decades longer
but was beaten out
by the New York world
in large part
because what they were doing
was boring
compared to the flashier,
scarier counterparts.
As mentioned,
the New York Times
and others like
the Washington Post
were more expensive
than the Yellow Penny papers
seen as elitist
and cosmopolitan
and thus
could not be trusted
by the little guy.
During the Nixon era,
the specter of communism
was alive and well
in universities
and Hollywood
and especially
the TV media
as live news reports
helped sway
public opinion
in favor of integration
and civil rights
and against
the war in Vietnam.
In response,
Nixon began
popularizing
the Hearst model,
this thing called
liberal media bias,
employing the rhetoric
that we know
so well today
to discredit
truthful reporting,
claiming that
any and all news
that did not fall
favorably upon
the administration
or their policies
was fake news,
a conspiracy
against the president.
We can follow
the popularity
of yellow journalism
up through
to Generoso Pope Jr.,
the son of an
Italian immigrant
turned successful
newspaper mogul
who had a vision
for the future
of a newspaper
he would purchase
called
the National Enquirer,
by most accounts
with mafia money.
Passing a car accident,
Gene,
as he was known,
witnessed drivers
and passengers
rubbernecking
to catch a glimpse
of the possible gore.
Making deals
with police,
he got dibs
on car accident photos
and crime scenes,
landing his publication
squarely in the category
of trashy exploitation,
along with headlines like,
Mom boiled her baby
and ate her.
For a while,
this classic
true crime style worked,
but eventually,
the readership
would start to level out,
and Gene realized
that he needed
more eyes
on his paper.
He needed to
bring it out of the dark
and into the hands
of the mainstream,
targeting an archetype
he created
called Missy Smith
in Kansas City,
a typical 1960s housewife
hungry for celebrity gossip
and sensational stories,
but without that gore
that kept the Enquirer
away from the innocence
of the checkout line.
And so,
the National Enquirer,
keeping with tradition,
would fall back
on paranormal stories
of aliens,
psychics,
and medical oddities.
Finally,
he would land
his newspaper
in that coveted spot,
placed in the checkout line
in almost every major
grocery store
where it remains
to this day.
By the 1970s,
at least 4.5 million people
were subscribed
to the National Enquirer,
far more than those
subscribed to
the New York Times.
But when we fast forward
20 years,
we see a very different
kind of National Enquirer
emerge as the paranormal
was rehomed
to the satirical
and ridiculous
weekly world news,
which Gene Pope
simply created
because he wanted
to figure out
what to do
with his old
black and white printer.
Celebrity gossip
would take over
most of the pages
of the National Enquirer
through the 80s and 90s
until a new editor
came on the scene
in 1999.
David Pecker
was a wannabe celebrity
and owner
of another popular tabloid
called Star
and had also published
a magazine
that was distributed
at all of Donald Trump's
properties called,
I kid you not,
Trump style,
with headlines like,
40 and fabulous.
A weekend at Trump Taj Mahal
can't help but be
an exhilarating exercise
in glamour and fun.
Before Pecker,
Trump was a favorite headline
for the National Enquirer
with his affairs
proving to be rich fodder.
But when Pecker arrived
on the scene
a decade later,
an agreement was made
that he would only print
positive stories
about Donald
and negative ones
about his enemies.
In fact,
Trump sometimes hid
behind fake identities
he created
in order to feed stories
to the National Enquirer
that he wanted
to be printed.
2015 featured headlines like,
Donald Trump's revenge
on Hillary
and her puppets.
Sociopath Hillary Clinton's
secret psych files exposed.
Hillary,
corrupt,
racist,
criminal.
However,
mysteriously missing
from the papers
were negative stories
about any one of Trump's
many salacious controversies
that would have fit perfectly
within the pages.
Pecker also famously buried
a story about Trump's affair
with model Karen McDougal,
paying her $150,000
to keep quiet.
When Marco Rubio
was the frontrunner
for the Republican nomination,
the National Enquirer
put out a story
that all but said
he worked as a gigolo
in Miami.
In a story more aligned
with the weekly world news,
the National Enquirer
also ran the headline,
Ted Cruz's father
linked to JFK assassination.
And then Trump,
live on Fox News,
repeated the completely
fabricated story
after calling into
his favorite show,
Fox and Friends,
to make them aware
of this bombshell report.
All I did
is point out the fact
that on the cover
of the National Enquirer
there was a picture
of him
and crazy
Lee Harvey Oswald
having breakfast.
Of course,
as the National Enquirer
was becoming
the most American
possible propaganda machine,
most people were getting
their disinformation
from Facebook friends
or Fox News,
with the Enquirer's sales
down 90%
since 1970.
However,
the more important thing
is that millions
and millions of people
pass through those
checkout lines
every day
and see those headlines,
just the evocative
block letters
of some of the most
shocking political news,
and the damage is done.
Because of this,
former Trump campaign
advisor Sam Nunberg
said that the National Enquirer
was even more valuable
than a campaign mailer.
At the same time,
Fox News was reaching
more people
than any other
television news network
by a serious margin,
making almost
$2 billion a year.
Enter American
hysteria royalty
Alex Jones
of the leading
conspiracy disinformation
site Infowars.
And let's also welcome
Alex Jones Light,
the allegedly handsome
Tucker Carlson
of Fox News.
During litigation,
both men
have copped up
to their myriad
of dangerous lies
to be, well, theater.
We've talked about
Alex Jones many times before.
He's most famous
for calling the Sandy Hook
shooting a false flag,
but he's also responsible
for repopularizing
the foundation
that would become
QAnon,
which we'll talk about soon.
When he wasn't
ripping off his shirt
in a display of anger
against the liberal elite,
Alex Jones liked to call up
his friend Trump
on the phone.
He'd become a kind
of advisor to Trump
after he appeared
on Infowars in 2015.
I just want to finish
by saying your reputation
is amazing.
I will not let you down.
You will be very,
very impressed,
I hope.
And I think
we'll be speaking a lot.
Well, I'm impressed.
I mean, you're saying
you're fully committed.
You know, there's no future
if we don't take
this country back.
Donald Trump,
I hope you can help
uncripple America.
Thank you so much, sir.
This interview was a huge deal
for Alex Jones's show.
And in fact,
on the night of the election,
Infowars would receive
similar viewership
to the major media outlets.
But it's important to note
that eventually,
Alex and Donald
had a little falling out
after Alex said
Trump wasn't returning
his calls anymore.
Hey, we've all been there.
When Jones's custody battle
became public
with his former wife,
she claimed he was,
surprisingly,
an unfit
and unstable parent
and used Infowars
as an example
of his personality.
However,
his attorney would claim
that his client
was simply, quote,
playing a character.
He is a performance artist.
However,
that night,
Jones put out a video
on Infowars
calling his own lawyer's
statement fake news,
quote,
They've got articles
out today
saying that I'm fake
and all this other crap.
Total bull.
The media is deceiving
everywhere.
I 110%
believe everything
that I stand for.
Thanks,
I wanted to do
that one myself.
Another suit
would be brought
against Alex Jones
by a parent
who had experienced
extreme harassment
after he called him
a paid actor
faking the death
of his little boy
during the Sandy Hook
shooting.
During his testimony,
Alex Jones claimed
he entered
periods of psychosis
and that could be blamed
for him creating
some of his wilder theories
like the idea
that Sandy Hook
was a hoax.
As for Tucker Carlson,
he was sued for slander
by Karen McDougal,
a.k.a.
Stormy Daniels,
a.k.a.
the woman whose story
the National Enquirer
famously buried.
This judge ruled
in favor of old Tuck,
agreeing with his lawyer's
assertions
that Fox News
is obviously
not a factual show,
stating that the,
general tenor
of it
reasonably informs
the viewer
that it is,
non-literal commentary,
exaggeration,
and
not
actual
facts.
These admitted
conmen
have had
unprecedented access
to Donald Trump
and have actively
guided
the inflammatory
conspiratorial rhetoric
of his administration.
Their ilk
has even landed
in the highest
levels of government
as Steve Bannon
became the chief
executive officer
of Trump's
2016 campaign
and then chief
strategist
after the election.
Bannon was the
former editor
of Breitbart News,
which was,
at the time of
Trump's election,
the most widely read
conservative site
in America,
which,
in exchange for
fawning coverage
and disgruntled
responses to criticism,
Trump granted
exclusive interviews
leading up to
the election,
increasing their
traffic 124%,
while they,
in turn,
helped Trump's
campaign with
the same old
stories of
liberal establishment
bias.
As we know,
even Russian troll
farms and even
freaking robots
tweeted out
outraged porn
and struck it rich,
even possibly
influencing our
2016 election
with inflammatory
rhetoric.
The conspiracy
industrial complex
is currently
thriving beyond
its wildest dreams
and my wildest
nightmares.
But just like
in the past,
satire has
played its own
role in the
spread of
alternative facts.
NPR did an
investigation into
one of the biggest
producers of
disinformation said
to possibly help
influence the
2016 election,
starting with one
story, one very
important story,
that was shared by
over 500,000
people,
quote,
FBI agents
suspected in
Hillary email
links found dead
in apparent
murder-suicide.
Now, in
Benjamin Franklin
style, this story
is totally false,
right down to the
local sheriff,
the murdered FBI
agent, and even
the town itself.
Regardless, over
the next 10 days,
the article would
get 1.6 million
views.
The man
responsible for
this site,
however, is no
Alex Jones, no
Steve Bannon, no
David Pecker, but a
man with a degree
in political science
who identifies as a
liberal living in
the suburbs of Los
Angeles.
He explained to
NPR that he got
into the business
of fake news in
2013 when he
identified a threat
in the rising
far-right movements,
and he went on to
create several sites
that sound like
reputable sources,
nationalreport.net,
usatoday.com,
WashingtonPost.com.co,
and DenverGuardian.com,
with a team of 25
writers working under
him, creating hundreds
and hundreds of
stories like this one,
and by his own
admission, he was
making, personally,
somewhere between
$10,000 to $30,000
a month, and he is
still at it.
But it's not about
the money, come on.
It's always been about
revealing the
hypocrisy of the
far-right.
But here's the
problem.
A lot of people
didn't get the
joke.
The most comprehensive
research on the
spread of false news
stories to date
came out of MIT,
which reported that
disinformation was
70% more likely to be
retweeted than
fact-based stories,
and that they also
traveled six times
faster, with stories
targeting the right
wing traveling farther
and faster by a
considerable margin.
They also found that
these stories specifically
evoke our more
reactive emotions,
anger, outrage, shock,
and the root of them
all, fear.
Oh, okay.
YouTube, Q's plan
saved the world.
It involves the whole
space force, possible
alien life, like
pedophiles, you know,
and it seeks to tie all
of that together.
And I feel like, I
mean, I know we've
discussed it a lot of
times, and we're like,
I'm not really sure I
believe that part of it,
but yet it just, I
don't think she's lying
to us, whoever he is.
An umbrella conspiracy
known as QAnon has
risen as a massive
online movement based
in perhaps the most
extreme and bizarre
disinformation that's
ever directly influenced
a presidential
administration.
with that magic mix
of grotesque true
crime, the strange
and unusual paranormal
and inflammatory
nationalistic politics.
It's the intoxicating
combination that once
made the tabloids a
roaring success with
people like old Missy
Smith in Kansas City,
while all the while
paving a way for people
like Alex Jones to
trickle down to people
like Tucker Carlson,
paving the way for a
president's megalomania
maniacal alternative
reality to take over
public consciousness.
This apparent far-right
intel is allegedly fed
to the followers through
a high-up government
official going by Q,
who has insight into
and leaks documents
about the secret war
that Trump is waging,
a global satanic
pedophile ring run by
Democrats and the
Hollywood elite,
along with anyone else
that can be folded into
this liberal agenda.
All puppeted by an elite
international Jewish
cabal with the
anti-Semitic hoax we
mentioned the protocols
of the elders of Zion
making its rounds yet
again, revived just as
Ben Franklin's debunked
story of the atrocities
of the scalp-hungry
indigenous tribes proved
useful decades later,
despite being completely
made up.
We hear the same
Hearstian language
of monstrous
communist
anarchist
enemies
from within,
the stories cast now
with the new villains
of today.
The stories of QAnon
began on obscure
alt-right
pro-Trump message boards,
and then slowly
leaked out
across Facebook
and Twitter,
and then across
alt-right mass media
at large,
with the outrage
around this
child sex ring
spreading,
gobbling up
any number
of fringe
conspiracy theorists
along the way.
In the mid-1800s,
a skeptical man
visiting the Cardiff
giant wrote
of a quote,
Joy in believing,
increased by the
peculiarly American
superstition,
that the correctness
of a belief
is decided by
the number of people
who can be induced
to adopt it.
A recent poll
from Yahoo News
found that on average,
37% of Trump supporters
believed at least
part of the QAnon
theory.
As these stories
are becoming
more and more
normalized,
more and more
believers are
actually reaching
positions in our
government,
using the springboard
of the QAnon
community to launch
vicious far-right
campaigns.
As he's done
in the past,
Trump recently
dodged the question
of QAnon
fantastically
at a town hall
hosted by
Savannah Guthrie.
In a shocking
moment,
he refused
to say
whether or not
the conspiracy
is true.
Let me ask you
about QAnon.
It is this
theory that
Democrats
are a satanic
pedophile ring
and that you
are the savior
of that.
Now,
can you just
once and for all
state that that
is completely
not true?
Can it disavow
QAnon
in its entirety?
I know nothing
about QAnon.
I just told you.
I know very little.
You told me,
but what you tell me
doesn't necessarily
make it fact.
I hate to say that.
I know nothing
about it.
I do know
they are very much
against pedophilia.
They fight it
very hard,
but I know
nothing about it.
I believe it is
a satanic call
run by the deep
states.
If you'd like me
to study the subject,
I know about Antifa
and I know about
the radical left
and I know how
violent they are
and how vicious
they are and I
know how they're
burning down cities
run by Democrats,
not run by Republicans.
Republican Senator
Ben Sasse said,
quote, QAnon
is nuts and real
leaders call
conspiracy theories
conspiracy theories.
He may be right.
Why not just say
it's crazy and not true?
He may be right.
I just don't know
about QAnon.
You do know.
I don't know.
No, I don't know.
I don't know.
In the most serious case,
as laid out by Jason Stanley
in How Fascism Works,
conspiracies and disinformation
are vital pillars
of fascist tactics.
It's important to see
this thing called fascism,
this word we hear
repeated so often,
as a process
rather than a destination.
Like the many moral panics
and conspiracy theories
we've learned about
over the last couple years,
fascist ideology
purposefully spreads
panics about women
and children
using sensationalized
sexual crimes
and gore.
They help create panics
about any number
of our societal
or cultural others.
They create a world
in which the them
is coming for the us,
coming to destroy
American traditions,
coming to destroy
the status quo
nuclear family.
At the same time,
the process purposefully
erodes trust
in standing institutions.
It refutes science,
academic research,
and professional reporting
as the evil liberal propaganda
of coastal elites.
All the wild conspiracy theories
we seem to be dealing with
almost daily
don't exist independently
of each other.
Instead,
they grow gnarled together
into a new mythology
propped up by those
in power,
most often
an authoritarian leader
who unrepentantly lies
and denies
until it becomes
normalized,
something that many
of us sigh at,
but something that's
also eating away
slowly
at our mass-shared reality.
Say we want to talk about
how to move through
a pandemic.
If I think that it's all
a democratic hoax
aimed at dethroning
the anti-satanic
spiritual superhero
of our generation
and you don't,
it makes reason debate
impossible.
And it can make
relationships impossible, too.
In the age of the internet,
where anyone can be
a journalist,
where anyone can say
anything is true
and get retweeted
six times faster,
the million-dollar question
is how do we combat
disinformation
beyond just the crackdowns
we're seeing
on social media sites?
We've talked often
about confirmation bias
and studies continue
to show that when
faced with ambiguous
evidence,
groups are more likely
to interpret the information
to support their
already held beliefs.
But things ramp up
even more so
with this research
around belief polarization
that has shown that
with issues that
elicit emotion,
people are more likely
to increase the strength
of their own views
when presented
with counter-evidence
than when presented
with evidence
that supports their views.
Let me say that
in a different way.
Imagine you decide
to respond to your
QAnon uncle's
Facebook post
with a well-researched paper
that refutes
whatever his claim
of the day is.
That actually makes him
more likely to strengthen
his belief
in the conspiracy theory,
even more so
than if you just
agreed with him.
Perhaps,
as I have cleverly
written here,
the oft-repeated
Trump campaign line
is more appropriate
inverted.
Facts don't care
about your feelings,
sure,
but also,
feelings don't care
about your facts.
But isn't that
kind of the thing?
Disinformation asks us
to feel the truth,
while facts ask us
not to feel anything
at all.
I know that when
I'm presented with evidence
that contradicts
a deeply held belief
of my own,
it hits me viscerally,
and it takes great effort
not to do the same thing,
to write it off
as fake news,
part of some kind
of conspiracy
against me.
Maybe this kind
of self-strong-arming
is just as hard
for you, too.
As author Kevin Young
writes in
Bunk,
The Rise of Hoaxes,
Humbug,
Plagiarists,
Phonies,
Post Facts,
and Fake News,
quote,
What if truth
is not an absolute
or relative,
but a skill,
a muscle like memory
that collectively
we have neglected
so much
that we've grown
measurably weaker
at using it?
Like fascism,
isn't truth a process
and not a destination?
But we act as if
we've already found it,
or at least
that we'll find it soon,
indisputably,
that we'll look through
that unimaginable telescope
and know.
This episode comes out
the night before
the 2020 presidential election
that will show us
which reality
will guide
our ongoing response
to the pandemic
and the economy
and the growing demand
for racial justice,
as well as what will become
of our democracy at large.
Like the Civil War,
the last five years
have pitted us
against family members
and friends,
have pitted two deeply
conflicting realities
against each other
with no fundamental
foundational facts
to fall back on,
no real way
to try
and talk it through.
This thing
we call
truth
is what stabilizes us,
what we hold
onto,
what keeps us
psychologically
safe.
My truth,
your truth,
our truth,
the truth,
has always been
an abstract thing
to move toward,
a kind of ultimate goal
to live inside of.
We want the truth
so bad,
all of us.
It's something
we all have in common
and that's why
all this nonsense
is happening
and it's also why
we're trying so hard
to combat it.
Truth is a lucrative
weapon.
It's an exploitive,
powerful abstraction
that gnaws at the most
human of our qualities,
our consciousness,
until we can be molded
by our desire
to just make sense
of it all.
I've always wanted
to find the truth
and as I've admitted,
I've believed
all kinds of wild theories
in hopes that I
had finally found it.
Maybe you've done
things like that too.
Maybe we seek the truth
so doggedly
in so many different ways
because if we could
just agree
on the fundamental,
foundational things,
there could be
a grander kind of hope
for us all,
an agreement
that America
is a process,
not a destination,
something fixed
in the sky
that we move toward.
We may never get there,
not in our lifetime,
but it feels good
to believe,
doesn't it,
in a lush paradise
hanging like a long
hidden truth
in the sky.
This was American Hysteria.
Next time,
on the show,
we're going to enter
that wild,
wonderful world

and fake news.
We're going to talk
about flim-flam
and fascism
and how they all
relate to each other
in our modern America.
