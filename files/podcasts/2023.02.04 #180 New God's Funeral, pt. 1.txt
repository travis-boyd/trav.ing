So, like, um, attention.
Everyone, the brown acid is a bummer.
And just want to repeat, you know, attention.
Unless, you know, attention is, like, not your bag, which I totally respect.
But for those of you who find, you know, attention really groovy, the brown acid is a bummer.
So, if you've already taken it, you want to go to Wavy Gravy's freakout tent.
Maybe you eat some, like, orange slices.
And you just got to keep telling yourself, it's okay.
It's okay.
Okay.
Because in 15 years, we're all going to work for IBM or Lehman Brothers or Northrop Grumman or, like, the Pentagon.
So, no matter how bad it seems now, don't worry.
Because you're going to be really fucking rich.
And the fact that you were here dropping acid is going to make you feel like you have a good excuse to be rich.
So, just everybody, just accept the vibrations.
Go on the journey.
Okay.
Okay.
Now, I want you to put that next to this.
And this, I think, might be the greatest one-liner of Frank Zappa's career, in which there is a lot of competition for that spot.
Frank Zappa once said, I think about this basically every day,
When the illusion of freedom becomes too expensive to maintain,
they will simply pull down the curtains, stack up all the tables and chairs,
and you will see the brick wall at the back of the theater.
If I have ever on this show used the phrase, brick wall at the back of the theater,
that is what I am talking about.
So, put the Zappa thing next to the Woodstock thing,
and put both of those next to this.
This is a section from Gravity's Rainbow,
and those of you who know the book will recognize it as taking place in the,
probably the most, like, out-and-out ridiculous part of the book in its main thrust,
that is to say, the section in the fourth division of the book,
that's essentially Slothrop, well, Slothrop or Pinchon, I guess,
imagining a comic book in the Raketenstadt, in the Fourth Reich,
imagining, you know, what is their sort of archetypal heroic entertainment going to be?
And it's just, you know, absurd and lurid and sort of very bright primary colors for a few pages.
But then something very, very fascinating happens,
and Pinchon departs completely from telling the story of these essentially new Nazi superheroes.
And it goes like this.
For the first time now, it becomes apparent that the Four and the Father conspiracy
do not entirely fill their world.
Their struggle is not the only or even the ultimate one.
Indeed, not only are there many other struggles,
but there are also spectators, watching, as spectators will do,
hundreds of thousands of them,
sitting around this dingy yellow amphitheater,
seat after seat plunging down in rows and tiers endless miles,
down to the great arena,
brown-yellow lights,
food scattered on the stone slopes up higher,
broken buns, peanut shells, bones,
bottles half-filled with green or orange sweet,
fires and small wind refuges,
set in angles where seats have been chiseled away,
shallow depressions in the stone,
and a bed of cherry embers where old women are cooking hashes
of the scavenged bits and crumbles and grisly lumps of food,
heating them in thin frying pans out of gray oil water,
bubbling as the faces of children gather around to wait for food,
and in the wind, the dark young man,
the slippery young knife who waits for your maid
outside the iron gate each Sunday,
who takes her away to a park,
a stranger's automobile,
and a shape of love you can never imagine,
stands now with his hair untended in the wind,
his head averted from the fire,
feeling the cold, the mountain cold,
at his temples and high under his jaw,
while beside other fires,
the women gossip,
one craning over now and then
to look miles downward at the stage,
to see if the new episodes come on yet.
crowds of students running by,
dark as ravens,
coats draped around their shoulders,
back out into a murky sector of seats,
which traditionally are never entered,
being reserved for the capital A ancestors.
Their voices fading,
still very intense,
dramatic,
trying to sound good,
or at least acceptable.
The women go on,
playing cards,
smoking,
eating,
see if you can borrow a blanket,
from Rose's fire over there,
it's going to be cold tonight.
Hey,
and a pack of armies while you're out,
and come right back,
hear me?
Of course,
the cigarette machine,
turns out to be Marcel,
who else,
in another of his clever mechanical disguises,
and inside one pack,
is a message for one of the spectators.
I'm sure you wouldn't want,
them,
to know about the summer of 1945.
Meet me in the male transvestites toilet,
level L1639C,
station Metatron,
quadrant fire,
stall Malkut.
You know what time,
the usual hour.
Don't be late.
Well,
there is the heart of it,
the monumental yellow structure,
out there in the slum suburban night,
the never sleeping percolation of life,
and enterprise through its shell.
Outside and inside,
interpiercing one another too fast,
too finely labyrinthine,
for either category to have much hegemony anymore.
The nonstop review crosses its stage,
crowding and thinning,
surprising and jerking tears,
in an endless ratchet.
And that could,
especially if you're hearing it out of context,
or if you've,
you know,
only read Gravity's Rainbow once,
for example,
not,
not that that's an insult or something,
that might just seem like,
um,
one of the,
you know,
many surreal episodes,
that dot,
the fourth section of the book.
But,
if you look at that episode,
typographically,
when Pinchon is talking about,
the crowd filling out and thinning,
and the endless parade of acts coming across the stage,
that section ends with a colon,
not a period,
which means that the entire rest of the book
is what is happening on that stage.
And,
uh,
this is what the,
the music critic,
largely Ben Watson,
calls a surrealist coup.
And,
and the,
maybe simplest definition of a surrealist coup,
would be,
it is an effect,
art can have,
whereby,
a given piece of art,
song,
movie,
book,
whatever,
places you in a particular environment,
and gives you,
you know,
the conditions and rules,
and population of that environment,
and you come to accept it,
as if it were,
as if it were real,
as,
as if it were,
not just mimesis of something else,
but diegesis,
you know,
an actual story going on in real time,
somewhere else in the world.
And then,
the surrealist coup,
is to suddenly pull down the walls,
rip off the roof,
and demonstrate to you,
this whole time,
you have been living inside something,
and you didn't know it.
This entire time,
everything you thought was the world,
has been enclosed.
It has had artificial limits placed upon it.
It is,
in fact,
one gigantic act of artifice.
And now,
the walls have been blown down.
And this raises the question,
whose artifice was it?
Who built that constricted world for you?
Why did they do it?
And,
this new,
broader world,
that you are suddenly given access to,
is this artifice too?
Because having had one world torn out from under your feet,
there's no particular reason to accept the next one,
right?
And,
in trying to think of examples of this,
I think,
for a lot of people,
maybe the most obvious would be something like,
A Day in the Life,
the Beatles song,
which,
you know,
spins its first half,
establishing,
this very sort of,
oracular,
dreamy atmosphere,
and is largely about death,
about,
the death of a real friend,
of the Beatles,
and then,
death as,
portrayed,
in a movie called,
How I Won the War,
that John Lennon starred in,
about the same time they made Sergeant Peppers.
And it's,
despite being concerned with death primarily,
it's not,
you know,
grim,
or morbid,
or nihilistic,
it has this sort of,
dazed,
dreamy,
kind of distance,
about it.
And then you go through,
that,
you know,
infamous,
monstrous,
orchestral buildup,
and suddenly,
snap,
you're in the Paul McCartney part of the song,
woke up,
got out of bed,
and it's not just,
that the,
two parts of the song,
are describing two different atmospheres,
it's that,
the sounds,
in both parts of the song,
are completely different too.
Every instrument,
is recorded differently,
between those two sections.
So instead of these kind of gentle,
strummy acoustic guitars,
and these very boomy drums,
that never actually lay down much of a backbeat,
they're just there for fills,
suddenly you get from that,
to a very tight,
snappy drum sound,
and a very tight,
snappy piano sound,
and they are all,
slamming right on the beat,
dun,
dun,
dun,
dun,
dun.
There's no ambiguity,
there's no confusion at all.
And whereas,
John Lennon's vocal,
in the first part,
is,
given some of that,
sort of,
oracular,
alien distance,
by having it run,
through a tape echo,
in the second part,
Paul McCartney's voice,
sounds like it's right,
up against your ear.
It couldn't possibly,
be more,
more detailed,
more,
I don't want to say crisp,
but more,
like the actual experience,
of hearing human speech,
and suddenly,
you have come out of the first half of the song,
what you thought was the world,
right,
and then into a new world,
with a radically different set,
of constraints,
and expectations,
what kind of sound,
can we use here,
what are we talking about,
you know,
are we talking about,
you know,
vague maxims,
like I'd love to turn you on,
no,
no,
no,
we're talking about getting up,
going to work,
getting on the bus,
you know,
blowing a joint,
before,
before you have to go to work,
and then there is this magical section,
maybe my favorite part of that song,
maybe,
maybe my favorite moment in all of the Beatles,
in which those two sections merge,
right after Paul McCartney sings,
somebody spoke and I fell into a dream,
you get this transitional section,
in which the rhythmic drive,
and the clearer tonality,
of the second fast part,
are very much in evidence,
but you also have the dreamy,
tape echoed sounds,
from the first part,
and so what you are hearing,
is the literal transition,
the literal translation,
of waking life,
into sleeping life,
which of course then ends,
with those massive horn parts,
the dun dun dun dun dun,
and then back into the John Lennon part,
and part of the reason,
that kind of surrealist coup,
has already,
has always,
pardon me,
fascinated me,
is that it is,
it is non-hierarchical,
it's not that the first part,
of the song is fake,
and the second part is real,
or vice versa,
no,
it's about,
the fact that,
life,
you know,
in total,
is made up of all of this,
the dream,
the imagination,
the,
you know,
internal mental world,
the exterior circumstances,
all of these things,
hold equal footing,
maybe not equal,
in,
you know,
the terms of like,
long term statistical outcomes,
because obviously,
there are a lot of,
historical materialist factors,
to talk about here,
but,
equal in the sense,
of their,
their shaping,
of what the world is,
to one person,
and thus,
the way one person,
will go on,
to shape the world,
so it's not that,
one of them is,
realer or better,
and the other is,
less real or fake,
it's that,
it is an infinite set,
of nesting dolls,
where the further away you go,
the closer you get back,
to the place you started,
but if you take,
just one more step beyond that,
then you're in a different place again,
it's,
you know,
like that,
what's it called,
the illusion,
the,
the Mobius strip,
it,
it's somehow,
only got,
one side,
there's somehow only,
only one track,
you can pursue across it,
even though it appears to,
it appears to be structured,
by this dichotomy,
of real fake,
inside,
outside,
artifice world,
whatever,
and,
part of the reason,
Gravity's Rainbow,
is one of my favorite books,
and I also think,
one of the most important books,
ever written,
I would say,
it's really between,
Gravity's Rainbow,
and Moby Dick,
for the greatest American novel ever,
and personally,
I choose,
Gravity's Rainbow,
one of the reasons for that,
is that Pinchot,
is,
I think,
probably,
the greatest novelist,
of all time,
when it comes to,
the use,
of the surrealist coup,
the building up,
of a set of,
you know,
logics,
and atmospheres,
and processes,
and personages,
that you accept,
while you're reading them,
as,
in the diegetic sense,
the real world,
they are the real world,
where the plot is happening,
and then,
just as in that passage,
he will,
completely wrench you,
into,
another,
related,
but very different reality,
you know,
he'll,
he'll kick the walls down,
and,
you'll realize,
you have been living,
let's say,
in what you thought,
was an entire city,
and,
it turns out,
that entire city,
is just one tiny part,
of this,
unimaginably vast,
megalocalypse,
that's not,
megalopolis,
pardon me,
and,
you had,
no idea of anything,
of that,
because the horizons,
for you,
are artificially,
foreclosed upon,
the limits,
that you consider,
the limits,
not only your world,
but the world,
someone else,
created those,
for you,
and,
this is always the case,
there,
there is no,
you know,
sort of capital R,
consensus,
reality,
without the artificial,
imposition,
of those limits,
which is why,
I think,
one of the most,
effective things,
that any kind of art,
can do,
is to demonstrate,
the possibility,
of both,
tearing down,
those limits,
but,
you know,
then,
so as not to be left,
with,
with,
with,
completely,
meaningless,
intractable chaos,
erecting,
a new set of limits,
trying to build,
a structure,
which,
you know,
while admittedly,
artificial,
is,
is,
more beneficial,
for the people,
living within it,
than,
the structure,
they have been given,
for the rest of their lives,
or,
I should say,
for the,
the,
the prior extent,
of their lives,
and I think,
it's especially effective,
the way,
Pinchon does it here,
because,
we're looking on,
three different levels here,
right,
there is,
the very,
goofy world,
of the kind of,
forthright comic strip,
that precedes,
this episode,
in the book,
and then suddenly,
instead of being in,
you know,
der Raketenstadt,
the capital,
of the fourth,
of the fourth,
the rocket city,
and,
instead of being in,
you know,
this,
various sort of,
glaring,
tacky,
unsubtle world,
of,
of hyper bright colors,
and,
you know,
ridiculous,
shallow,
persona,
for the characters,
he's talking about,
you are snapped,
out of that place,
and,
into the,
actual world,
in which,
at this point,
in the book,
and I think,
you could argue,
for maybe,
most of history,
certainly most of,
modern history,
where history is actually,
happening,
and,
it's in the slums,
it is happening,
among,
people who are,
having to scrounge,
for anything,
they can find to eat,
who are having to,
you know,
sleep outside,
in the cold,
and praying,
that someone,
you know,
gives them a blanket,
or,
accidentally throws out,
a piece of clothing,
they could use,
as a bed sheet,
people who are,
picking up,
you know,
two-thirds,
smoked cigarettes,
off the ground,
and,
taking the little bit,
of tobacco left there,
and rolling it up,
with shit like string,
just to have,
something to smoke,
these are the,
the impoverished,
mass,
of people,
after,
essentially,
the end of history,
we weren't using,
that term yet,
and,
in 1973,
Pinchon wouldn't have,
known that,
in 1973,
but this is what,
we are talking about,
these are people,
who exist,
after,
any sort of,
linear ambition,
or pretense,
to linear progress,
has been,
completely abandoned,
there is nowhere,
to go,
but here,
there,
there is no,
thought,
that,
anything they are doing now,
is ever going to lead,
to anything,
different,
in the future,
and this is the situation,
in which,
you know,
obviously,
there have been versions of this,
since,
the beginning of mankind,
but,
this is specifically,
the situation,
in which,
global capitalism,
US foreign policy,
and the,
absorption,
of fascism,
into the fourth,
Reich,
has placed,
many,
if not,
most,
of the people,
on earth,
and,
and I love the fact,
that it's an amphitheater too,
because,
amphitheaters have,
you know,
this,
this traditional association,
with,
and pretense,
to grandeur,
that they're based on,
ancient Greek architecture,
although often,
not very well,
based on ancient Greek architecture,
and,
that,
if you go to an amphitheater,
you are seeing something,
both socially,
and,
and artistically,
elevated,
and maybe even elevated,
to the point,
of ritual,
ritual significance,
because,
you know,
as far as we can tell,
it looks very probable,
that the early Greek,
classical Greek drama,
came out of,
what were essentially,
religious festivals,
that,
you know,
a playwright like,
you know,
Aeschylus,
or Sophocles,
was writing,
not with the idea of,
himself as an auteur,
right,
and everyone's going to follow,
his vision,
no,
they were doing sort of,
competingly,
elaborated versions,
of,
of religious,
mystery rituals,
you know,
that,
I don't know,
that there is any,
dispositive,
you know,
hard evidence,
on all of this,
but I have seen people,
who study the subject,
talk about,
the idea,
that it's very possible,
that the whole,
whole practice,
of Greek theater,
comes out of,
religious pilgrimages,
to this place,
that used to be called,
Eleusis,
in Greek,
and now I think,
it's called Eleusis,
and,
in,
Eleusis,
there was this,
sort of,
giant,
underground chamber,
called the Telesterion,
and,
within that Telesterion,
were conducted,
a series of,
sort of,
mystic,
not passion play,
but,
like,
religious mystery play,
rituals,
known as,
the Eleusinian mysteries,
and,
there are,
you know,
competing schools,
of thought,
about what exactly,
those were,
but most people,
I have read,
seem to,
agree,
with,
with the,
the notion,
that,
there are some,
sort of,
death,
and resurrection,
process,
some,
some,
sort of,
way to see oneself,
not necessarily,
in a personal sense,
not,
you know,
you're going to die,
and come back,
but,
death,
and resurrection,
in the sense,
that,
the world,
is made up,
of these,
recurring patterns,
that,
change,
as they recur,
to be sure,
but,
often take,
very similar shapes,
even if the,
the form,
that gives them shape,
is not exactly,
the same,
right,
so,
very akin,
to,
you know,
Osirian rites,
in Egypt,
or the rites,
of,
Atis,
in,
I believe,
what's now,
modern,
Syria,
Lebanon,
or the,
long,
pre-Christian,
pagan rites,
of,
Adonis,
a bunch of places,
in,
in the Mediterranean,
among them,
I don't know,
if they still do it,
I hope they do,
in Italy,
that,
it,
it could be observed,
as late as,
the middle,
20th century,
that Italian people,
who,
were,
full on,
absolutely,
unambiguous Catholics,
you know,
people whose lives,
were often based around,
the image,
and concept,
of Catholicism,
that still,
there was a point,
every year,
when,
because of,
a certain amount,
of rainfall,
in a certain,
river basin,
I wish I could,
remember the name,
all of this,
red dirt,
would,
flow out,
from this river,
to the sea,
and it made that river,
look like blood,
and,
you know,
old Italian,
Catholic women,
would,
go out there,
and,
and perform,
essentially,
mourning rites,
because,
this,
dyed red river,
was considered,
ritually,
to be,
the blood,
of the recently slain,
Adonis,
who,
like,
most dying,
and reborn gods,
has,
has his basis,
in,
you know,
the annual,
or,
more than annual,
monthly,
weekly,
whatever,
cycles,
of various kinds,
of natural process,
that Adonis,
was the,
the personalized,
encapsulation,
of the,
patterned energies,
of nature,
these are,
these women,
are going out,
you know,
wearing crucifixes,
to do this,
and,
I don't know,
if this is still true,
either,
but,
they used to,
carry,
cocoons,
butterfly cocoons,
either in their pockets,
or,
in sort of,
the laps,
of their dresses,
and those,
butterfly cocoons,
were of course,
supposed to be,
for,
death,
and not just,
death and resurrection,
but death,
transformation,
and resurrection,
that's the key part,
this is what,
um,
Christianity,
uh,
really leaves out,
and I think,
the way Christianity,
fucked up,
at least from a,
theological perspective,
well,
there are quite a few,
ways it fucked up,
but,
to me,
the,
the,
the sort of,
I mean,
I'm not using this word,
with,
with terrible seriousness,
it's not like I,
actually want to fight somebody over it,
but the blasphemy,
of,
having death,
and resurrection,
without any sort of,
transmutation,
in between,
because that's not how shit works,
you know,
all of these early pagan,
or animist religions,
and rituals,
are,
drawn from,
the observation,
of the way,
nature behaves,
and eventually,
over enough time,
uh,
observation of the way,
human species behaves,
and it's never just,
that they die,
and then they come back,
they are transfigured,
in between,
everything that dies,
is,
a process of transmutation,
and,
when it returns,
you may not recognize it,
because it has been,
transmuted,
I think that's a part of the,
the essence,
of,
I don't want to go out,
and say something like,
the one true religion,
but,
the essence,
essentially,
of,
of the,
the basic,
religious,
and,
and,
ritual,
principles,
and tenets,
that,
have held together,
you know,
human,
human concepts,
of the divine,
and of the,
you know,
intelligence,
or mind,
of the cosmos itself,
since,
basically,
as far back,
as we have,
so anyway,
that was a,
I mean,
I could say,
it's a tangent,
they're all tangents,
it's all a tangent,
it has been suggested,
by,
a number of people,
that,
the,
whole Greek,
dramatic tradition,
comes out of,
essentially,
modified versions,
of,
religious ceremonies,
and that the,
most crucial,
one of these,
was the,
El Eusinian mysteries,
this was an event,
for which people,
would travel on foot,
from all over Greece,
to get to,
El Eusis,
or El Eusis,
and witness,
in,
in this,
sort of mystery,
sacral chamber,
underground,
and of course,
if you wanted to,
then,
draw out,
the sort of,
structural,
and anatomical,
resonances of that,
especially,
when you put it,
alongside something like,
the Sefirot,
and the Kabbalistic,
Tree of Life,
you know,
there,
there is clearly,
a lot going on there,
and,
it has also been,
theorized,
I don't know,
to what degree,
of,
substantiation,
but theorized,
at least,
that,
part of,
these mysteries,
both the El Eusinian,
and certain,
other,
devotional cults,
like,
the,
the rites of Orpheus,
for example,
also included,
the ingestion,
of some kind of,
profoundly,
mind-altering,
substance,
I don't know enough,
about the subject,
to know,
what substance,
that would be,
but I would assume,
something perhaps,
like,
mushrooms,
or something like,
the ergot,
that,
that grows,
on certain,
types of grain,
ergot,
being very close to,
chemically,
anyway,
close to,
the kind of thing,
LSD does,
and so,
there,
there is no,
dramatic tradition,
and,
thus,
probably no,
literary tradition,
without connection,
to these things,
and,
the roots,
of these things,
are going,
from one environment,
your everyday world,
to another environment,
and,
witnessing something,
that kicks out,
all the struts,
that we're holding up,
what you consider,
to be,
the world,
and,
makes you,
understand,
that,
you have been living,
in,
I hate the phrase,
living in a bubble,
because of what that,
you know,
what that means,
in sort of,
shitty,
political,
wonk discourse,
but,
you have been living,
in,
a structure,
of artifice,
and,
there is an entire,
world,
beyond that structure,
of artifice,
and,
here,
in,
this,
incredible passage,
from Gravity's Rainbow,
and,
I apologize,
if I,
didn't read that,
especially well,
or if it sounds quiet,
or something,
it's hard to hold a book,
with both hands,
and do this,
at the same time,
I think there,
there can be no accident,
in the,
the crash cut,
you know,
between,
a comic book,
and,
and,
a quasi-ancient amphitheater,
or a real,
ancient amphitheater,
because,
I think Ben-Sean,
is,
is,
you know,
very obviously,
suggesting,
the,
the comic book version,
we get of the Raketenstadt,
where it's,
you know,
four superheroes,
each of whom,
also has a fatal flaw,
and,
they're trying,
you know,
to,
prevent the evil plot,
set in motion,
decades ago,
by Slothrop's father,
which of course,
suggests,
that this is also,
Slothrop having,
a kind of a dream,
because,
at this point in the book,
Slothrop has,
ceased to be a person,
really,
and has sort of,
you know,
dissociated on a molecular level,
into being just a vague,
sort of presence,
so we have,
the cheapest,
newest,
kind of,
most tasteless,
most jingoistic,
propagandistic form,
of mass entertainment,
that would have been,
available,
pardon me,
well,
valuable too,
roughly around,
the end of,
World War II,
and,
the beginning of,
what I,
will always keep calling,
World War III,
and the Fourth Reich,
we get these,
absurd,
caricatural figures,
who each embody,
what is supposedly,
you know,
one pillar of strength,
of,
of American empire,
each of whom,
is also then,
cursed,
quote unquote,
with,
with one fatal weakness,
because,
if they were only pillars of strength,
it wouldn't be very interesting,
right,
there,
there'd be no drama,
there'd be no stakes,
they would just win every time,
which is kind of the whole,
you know,
Superman problem,
to cut from that,
to,
as he puts it,
hundreds of thousands,
of people,
in an amphitheater,
an amphitheater,
amphitheater that is so,
large,
that from the top seats,
it is miles,
from you to the stage,
an amphitheater,
so large,
and so ancient,
and containing,
so many,
kind of,
you know,
wandering tribes,
of people,
who have accidentally,
lived through the end of the world,
that they are cutting,
new seats,
into the stone,
the amphitheater is,
you know,
not on a,
a large scale,
coordinated level,
but,
insofar as it's actually being used,
it's an expansionary project,
we need more amphitheater,
we need more room in the audience,
because,
the world,
that,
that you know,
the world that you can expect to find,
through normal histories,
normal media outlets,
whatever,
that's all happening,
in comic book,
Raketenstadt,
pardon me,
the rest of the world,
the real world,
when you kick down the walls,
of,
you know,
the comic book world,
that is happening,
in the poverty,
and scrounging,
and desperation,
and,
you know,
exposure to the elements,
of,
of,
this amphitheater,
I,
you know,
I don't like to bring myself,
into things,
too much,
if I don't have to,
but,
this passage,
has always been particularly,
resonant,
and also frightening,
to me,
because,
when I had my first,
major,
psychotic breakdown,
I was,
very thoroughly,
convinced,
that,
the wind,
it happened to be,
a very windy day,
that the wind,
was blowing,
parts of me,
away,
not literally,
like,
removing,
you know,
my organs,
or limbs,
or whatever,
but that,
every time,
the wind blew,
it erased me,
a little bit more,
from,
the world,
in which,
anybody else,
could understand me,
it deleted me,
one degree further,
from any sort of,
shared social context,
in which,
it was possible,
for other people,
to see and hear me,
at all,
let alone,
know who I was,
let alone,
you know,
understand what I was saying,
I really thought,
for about a week,
I was disappearing,
piece by piece,
because of this wind,
and ever since then,
the,
the idea of wind,
and the phrase,
out there in the wind,
has always been,
resonant for me,
on a very,
nervous,
sharp level,
because to me,
out there in the wind,
means,
you are,
a hair's breadth,
from disappearance,
you are one,
wrong,
fucking turn away,
from never being seen,
or heard from again,
and,
in a way,
the cruelest part of that,
is that,
you are not,
that close to dying,
you are not that close to,
you know,
whatever,
relief,
or at least,
cessation of pain,
you might get by simply,
not being a person anymore,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
what you are in danger of,
is being,
transmuted,
into this realm,
where,
you still have,
the vague idea,
of who,
what you are,
or at least,
who and what you used to be,
but now,
there is no,
context,
in which,
other people,
can explain you,
to themselves,
there is no context,
into which you can be situated,
that makes you,
make any kind of sense,
and,
every time,
whether in art,
or in,
you know,
first person experience,
or in,
you know,
massive political machinations,
every time,
we perform,
one of these surrealist coups,
every time,
we,
we suddenly reveal,
to people,
that they have been living,
inside a planned structure,
their entire lives,
without knowing it,
there is a,
real good constituency,
of people,
who will do,
anything they can,
to get back,
inside,
of that planned structure,
and,
I'm not even really,
criticizing them,
I,
I don't,
particularly mean that,
as an insult,
because being outside,
of that structure,
is fucking terrifying,
realizing,
that you now share,
zero reference points,
with anyone,
on earth,
and that there is,
effectively,
zero chance,
of anyone,
ever knowing,
what you're talking about,
in the,
the simplest,
most functional,
most pragmatic way,
let alone,
anything more complex,
than that,
you suddenly realize,
that,
not only,
are you,
alone,
on this earth,
but actually,
everybody is alone,
they are just,
blessed with not,
knowing that,
yet,
I remember,
you know,
during that,
that psychotic break,
that feeling,
of wind blowing,
made me have,
this sort of vision,
of the,
the atmosphere,
of the earth,
disappearing,
that,
the way I expressed it,
back then,
and the way I still think of it,
is that,
the sky was gone,
and,
when I say sky,
I don't mean,
you know,
the,
the concentration of,
of,
oxygen,
and hydrogen,
and nitrogen,
and,
and,
you know,
carbon,
whatever atoms,
that makes up,
you know,
the,
the,
the technical,
scientific phenomenon,
of the atmosphere,
I mean,
the sky,
as in,
what we all see,
when we look up,
right,
because,
the sky,
for me,
is the,
the kind of essential image,
of,
the belief,
that you,
no matter who you are,
share enough,
context,
or commonality,
with anyone else,
on earth,
that,
as long as you have,
some way to communicate,
with each other,
even just by gestures,
you too,
will be able,
to figure out,
what's going on together,
you know,
anything,
from talking,
to,
you know,
fucking mathematics,
whatever it is,
you know,
people in the sciences,
are always doing work,
across linguistic lines,
and it doesn't,
really hinder them,
all that much,
in fact,
it,
often tends to help them,
in really awful ways,
the sky is,
context,
the sky is,
enclosure,
the sky is the,
envelope,
around the earth,
which assures you,
no matter where I am,
I'm always under the sky,
no matter what happens to me,
I am always,
in the same,
sort of,
general,
what would you call it,
barometric belt,
as everybody else is,
I am still,
you know,
existing,
within this sort of,
marginal airlock zone,
between earth,
and outer space,
that I can rely upon,
to be there every day,
and to act,
one of a few,
pretty predictable ways,
every day,
when the sun goes down,
I don't worry about it,
staying down,
when the sun is up,
I don't worry about it,
staying up,
and I share these,
these presumptions,
and,
and this set of,
contextual,
structures,
I should say,
or,
contextual structural members,
would perhaps be better,
I share that enough,
with everyone else,
on earth,
that there is,
at least,
some commonality,
we can all,
work within,
and,
when I had that,
breakdown,
what I saw was,
first,
it actually looked like,
the sky was breaking,
it,
it looked like,
there were sort of,
thin,
silvery chunks,
falling off,
of the sky,
if you've ever seen,
really,
really,
expensive,
uncut cocaine,
it looked a lot,
like that,
there's a reason,
they call that shit fish scale,
and,
with the sky gone,
so I thought,
I no longer,
had anything,
to do with anybody,
I was just,
one,
terrified,
lone mammal,
hanging off,
the side of the earth,
by accident,
one,
one,
terrified,
lone creature,
with really,
nothing,
to,
to differentiate myself,
from the entire,
you know,
both,
awesome,
and awful horror,
of the,
the unspeaking universe,
and,
not only was I like that,
but so was everybody else,
they just hadn't,
accidentally,
punched through,
the envelope yet,
they still had that sky,
although,
at the time,
I was,
I was very worried,
that the fact,
that I was seeing this,
meant that a whole lot,
of other people,
were going to see it too,
and,
of course,
there's some,
you know,
obvious,
sort of,
Freudian,
or Jungian,
psychoanalytic,
parallels,
or,
or,
distinctions,
you can draw there,
about,
something like,
ecological collapse,
which is,
of course,
true,
but,
that's not what it was rooted in,
it was rooted in the idea,
that I,
I was becoming,
not just,
uh,
incomprehensible,
but,
imperceptible,
even to myself,
very,
very much,
in fact,
like Slothrop,
in the last section of Gravity's Rainbow,
I cannot believe,
I have never had that thought before,
holy fucking shit,
I'm sorry,
you're listening to me have a personal epiphany,
I have never connected those two things,
until this moment,
that's fucking incredible,
oh,
of course that's what happened,
that,
that's obvious as hell,
my brain wasn't even being subtle about it,
Jesus Christ,
well,
you got to listen to that in real time,
um,
and,
you know,
these,
these moments,
um,
of disclosure,
that one is trapped inside an artificial structure,
uh,
do risk,
uh,
psychosis,
do risk schizophrenia,
you know,
I think you could argue that,
um,
whether he was writing,
you know,
his,
his early sort of,
attempts at working class fiction,
or stuff that was outright sci-fi,
or stuff that kind of pushed sci-fi into,
you know,
uh,
deep,
deep politics territory,
or pushed it into,
you know,
uh,
pop culture,
or religion,
or whatever else,
I think you could argue that the central,
the central tenet,
and also the central horror,
of Philip K.
Dick's,
entire written work,
is that,
you don't live in the world you think you live in,
no one lives in the world they think they live in,
and,
if you meet someone from outside that world,
uh,
not only will your brain crack in half,
as a result of what they tell you,
but that person also doesn't live in the world he or she thinks she lives in.
It,
it is an infinitely echeloned unreality.
There is no real question of what the real world is,
unless you,
you know,
you get full on into Gnosticism,
and,
and believe that,
you know,
the,
the redemptive logos is going to return to earth,
either in the form of Jesus Christ,
or something else,
to,
you know,
banish the falsehoods of the Demiurge,
whatever,
but apart from that,
there,
there's no real,
real is only,
I've,
I've thought many times about how to define this,
how to say,
you know,
real in a philosophical sense,
like,
well,
nothing is real in a philosophical sense,
if you bore down enough on it,
um,
real,
I think,
maybe you could,
the best argument you could make for something being real,
is that it causes pain,
and,
I don't just mean physical pain,
I,
I mean,
you know,
intense,
uh,
emotional,
mental pain,
uh,
if,
if the things that agonize all of us,
uh,
and,
and I really do mean all of us,
uh,
if,
if those aren't real,
what does it matter?
I don't fucking care.
The,
the things,
the things that agonize me are real enough to me,
that's all the reality I'm ever gonna need.
Um,
but,
I think part of the reason Philip K. Dick ended up,
you know,
in the territory of Valus,
and the transmigration of Timothy Archer,
uh,
was it Timothy Archer?
I think so.
Um,
uh,
and the,
uh,
books like,
you know,
Radio Free,
Albemute,
and,
uh,
eventually the,
the exegesis of Philip K. Dick,
which,
I have to say,
I have read some of,
and I thought I would be really interested in it,
but it,
it actually struck me as just really sad.
As,
as a guy who,
clearly,
you know,
had a fascinating mind anyway,
and had had some serious brushes with psychosis,
trying to reassemble systematically something that could explain what he had seen and been through,
and constantly revising himself,
and contradicting himself,
and having to go back and change things,
and then making statements with the,
the kind of,
um,
the kind of forced certainty
that almost always means
the person saying it,
uh,
not only isn't sure that it's true,
but actually really worries that it's false.
You know,
the,
the same thing kind of with,
um,
with William Volman's rising up and rising down.
You know,
people use that horrible term,
moral calculus,
all the time now,
but as far as I know,
it comes from that book,
and Volman was literally trying to construct a moral calculus,
a,
a mathematical system
that could tell him whether,
you know,
X was more or less evil than Y,
which is just brutally sad,
sorrowful as hell,
because you only do that kind of thing
if you have come to a point of absolute desperation
with both the way the world works around you,
and the kind of things that you have seen,
and done,
and focused on,
and for whatever reason,
found yourself unable to rid the world of.
Uh,
but,
I think there is a step here in Pinchon,
beyond the Philip K. Dick step,
of what they call the mise en abeim,
which means literally put into the abyss,
and it's the,
um,
the graphic effect that is generated by,
let's say,
and some people call it the Dröste effect,
which I believe was a brand of,
like,
hot chocolate,
coffee,
something like that,
and the box for Dröste
had a guy holding up a box of Dröste,
and then on the box in the picture,
there was another picture of a guy holding up a box,
and in the picture,
on the picture of the box,
in the picture,
there was another one,
you know,
the,
the infinite regress,
and so with,
with a,
a Philip K. Dick novel,
like,
one of my favorites,
like,
the,
the stigmata of Palmer Eldridge,
you end up in this complete,
you know,
uh,
vertiginous,
insanity-inducing state,
where there is,
there is arguably nothing beyond,
continual deception,
you can be undeceived,
and whatever undeceives you,
will end up deceiving you even worse than the first thing,
whereas,
I,
I read this part of Pinchon,
and I see something much closer,
to the world as I recognize it,
uh,
because there are two layers going on here,
right,
the,
number one,
the people who really are out there,
living in that amphitheater,
they are fucking suffering,
they are in trouble,
this is not,
a question of abstract speculation for them,
they don't fucking care about the demiurge,
you know,
if the demiurge could make them,
uh,
not starve to death,
I'm sure they would be happy to serve it,
uh,
so there is that edge to it,
but then there is also,
the fascinating,
and to me,
terrifying,
idea,
that,
you go outside of the fake world,
of the comic book,
right,
and what you find,
is this gigantic amphitheater,
full of hundreds of thousands,
of starving,
homeless people,
but,
they're in the amphitheater,
so they can watch,
what's happening on stage,
they're not in the amphitheater,
because they want to know the truth,
because they,
you know,
couldn't bear to live lies,
and had to be,
you know,
exposed to the actual world,
because they had to,
you know,
shuck themselves,
the artificial cocoons,
of unreality,
they are there,
because,
miles away,
there,
there is a procession,
of clowns,
and jugglers,
and singers,
and presidents,
and generals,
and bombs,
going across this stage,
they can barely even see,
miles and miles down,
like Pinchon says,
it's,
it's not even clear,
to most of them,
what is happening,
but,
the what on stage,
is really,
less what,
than the,
that on stage,
which is to say,
doesn't matter what it is,
it matters that it is,
that something,
is happening,
and,
it is this,
idea,
that I want to take up,
next time,
in talking,
particularly,
about,
the,
late 60s,
and,
the concept,
that I referred to,
in the previous episode,
as,
being on the reservation.
presentation,
and,
the second one,
the,
the,
the summer season,
and,
the rest of the table,
coming back into the kitchen.

To the world
Can't we all just get along
Like Amazon
And Raytheon
Coming together to make a drone
To bring us lunch
And kill the sun
In a city just to do the one
Holistic joy
To the world
Please stop resisting
All the joy
In your world
Just a car full of celebrities
Singing about the joy
In your boat
A string of bad luck
In this final turn
We gathered around
Watched our cities burn
Who could have possibly predicted this?
Said everyone
So we boldly venture into the black
Guided by a grand soundtrack
We'll liberate some foreign stars
And stick a flag on the face of Mars
The beauty of starting again
With patience, zero and original sin
The mantra rings across the land
How clever
Look at us
We've done it again
We're bringing joy
To whole new worlds
You must admit
We've certainly got a knife
To bring joy
To whole new worlds
In the time these aliens
Will wonder
Out of the joy
We'll bring
A whole new worlds
We're bringing joy
To your world
You better hope
You don't have cheap bananas
Or ice
We're bringing joy
To your world
You better hope
You don't have dead dinosaurs
We'll bring joy
To the joy
