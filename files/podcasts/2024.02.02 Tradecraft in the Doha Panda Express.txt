0.00 41.26 SPEAKER_01  and welcome to the trash future racism hour no i can't i can't intro it like that can i i don't usually get to intro the show um no i wanted to bring up some important news which is which is that um at the time of recording lawrence fox has lost his has i don't think he's lost the case but no i mean he lost he lost in all counts but it's sort of a bit more there's it's not to do with whether he's racist or not but it was more the fact that he kept going online and kept
41.26 56.18 SPEAKER_06  calling people pedophiles it wasn't justiciable whether or not he was racist because it didn't it wasn't held to have damaged his reputation enough calling him a racist to investigate whether or not he was racist he was he was saying good evening pedophiles to that uh but and that
56.18 114.56 SPEAKER_01  can get you thrown in prison these days however i did come across something uh just like a little segment from the uh from the cross-examination and i thought i thought i'd share it with all of you um so this is coming from the guardian where uh so so guys under cross-examination fox suggested that there are contexts in which the phrase i hate black people was not racist he said this is a quote from him if a man is just released from a ugandan jail where he's been gang raped by several men and he walks out and he goes i hate black people it's a sort of understandable response but there's a bit more there's a bit more lawrence lawrence as your lawyer i advise you to keep saying this shit and he does yeah asked whether it was racist to say quote black people in the uk should go home fox said it depends on what the context is what yeah go go back to their house where they live i think that's what he meant yeah go home from work i think i don't want to say that's what he meant because it's very clear what he actually meant but like what he at least was implying
114.56 122.36 SPEAKER_02  incredible it's so awesome to see the finest legal mind second only to dershowitz work out
122.36 154.80 SPEAKER_06  he wanted so badly for the court to tell him he was racist so that he could be like the woke courts have silenced me merely for saying that if the plot of midnight express happens to you but in uganda for some reason yeah and then you become racist that makes you a racist but they wouldn't they wouldn't even bother they didn't give him the satisfaction he said he's going to appeal to like find out from court whether or not he's racist which is going to be i didn't think that it would require such a kind of fact-finding expedition to find out whether or not lawrence fox is racist
154.80 165.92 SPEAKER_02  look he wants to know whether he needs to change and grow look here's the thing two three maybe four more lawsuits are all we need to get to the bottom of this thing it's the same as the turf shit it's
165.92 178.42 SPEAKER_06  just like if you just stay in court forever wasting everyone's time then uh question mark question mark question mark and then you know woke is defeated but the thing with lawrence fox is sort of that he's
178.42 205.72 SPEAKER_01  not i don't want to say as smart as them but he kind of i feel like he's sort of in he he's sort of so stuck in his own sort of sense of what he believes he is that every time people is like lawrence you you can just like stop you don't have to do this like but he just insists for whatever reason but no he must he must go to court every month to sort of prove that he's not a racist only to sort of be told but like buddy like you've got to read the stuff that you're saying and really think about it
205.72 209.06 SPEAKER_06  after the divorce went through he's like jonesing to get back into court
209.06 215.10 SPEAKER_02  they cut him off from family court so it's like shawshank redemption he's been institutionalized
215.10 227.14 SPEAKER_04  but to court that's right he just loves seeing the wigs he needs it really badly that's me the only racist man in shawshank all right all right ugandan shawshank i don't recognize the woke courts i
227.14 233.80 SPEAKER_02  only recognize chrissy's court all right all right uh hi everybody uh the last king of shawshank
233.80 246.84 SPEAKER_06  thank you very much if you get out of shawshank prison and then you say i hate black people that does make you racist especially given that morgan freeman helped you escape yeah that's right it's
246.84 267.68 SPEAKER_02  not just racist it's also ungrateful i want to say hussein thank you for bringing in the show and can i ask any of you all of you uh-huh but on a scale of nine to ten how much do you want to go to an oil and gas themed theme park in saudi arabia 15 i would love that actually i think that'd be cool
267.68 273.48 SPEAKER_06  yeah i could get to uh see the two guys covered in mud like throwing the big sort of metal frame
273.48 284.66 SPEAKER_02  around like from the tweets yeah they're they're they're the mascot yeah they're they're walking they're like no there's there's just like out of work actors in saudi arabia yeah i'm like a disney
284.66 292.10 SPEAKER_04  adult but for the oil rig guys so so yeah i'm peri petrol but like what's my motivation like why like
292.10 305.60 SPEAKER_02  why do i want to combust alice disney adult but for the oil rig guys that's just the entire writing staff of compact magazine hello we are we are cooking today what magazine don't worry about
305.60 311.60 SPEAKER_04  it it's very easy to read though because it folds up very small yeah it's the magazine about anything
311.60 338.42 SPEAKER_02  small so you can submit uh it's sort of uh it's called micro fiction yeah uh so no uh i think we might have mentioned this before but i don't think we talked about it in detail uh the master plan for and i'm sorry this is just this like this show now has a saudi arabia segment but that's right the master plan for the rig which is the world's first adventure tourism destination master plan for
338.42 343.02 SPEAKER_04  the rig is like one of the guys in the gibbo group chat around april planning his summer holiday
343.02 361.26 SPEAKER_02  he's getting on the protein shakes it's a world first adventure tourism destination to be built on an offshore oil platform in the arabian gulf it will redefine water sports and leisure while celebrating the legacy of saudi arabia's water sports in the bank iron toilet while celebrating the legacy of
361.26 384.12 SPEAKER_06  saudi arabia's rich oil and gas heritage cool so i mean this is this is kind of there's a bit of baudrillard happening here right because the point of vision 30 2030 is to get saudi off of all of the kind of like dutch disease oil problem right where all their money is petrodollars but the best thing they've come up with besides the line is what if we just pretended to do the oil thing and then
384.12 396.04 SPEAKER_02  tourists came around and went that's cool you know what it is is they read um uh they read david banks's book on on urbanism and we're like oh we'll have the oil rig themed yeah david david banks's
396.04 412.12 SPEAKER_04  book the saudi authentic yeah a rich oil and gas heritage is such a funny thing to say because it implies that like people are interested you know like people are like oh you've not really had petrol until you've had it in saudi arabia honestly it doesn't travel that well it's different also
412.12 419.02 SPEAKER_02  it's like it's nostalgic for like the middle of the 20th century basically yeah you can't oh man no
419.02 426.06 SPEAKER_04  you can't have diesel in that you gotta go straight petrol can i have the longer petrol list please
426.06 445.18 SPEAKER_02  yeah you you also wonder right why there's no set why it's so weird to like celebrate the heritage of oil and gas it's because the dawn of oil and gas was the thing that made what so much of what we experience so kind of disposable and temporary and the same everywhere but also the fact that they're
445.18 456.90 SPEAKER_06  refusing to sunset oil and gas but instead persisting with the oil and gas celebrating the heritage of something they're still actively doing the united states and plantation weddings thank you i'm sort of
456.90 491.56 SPEAKER_01  curious about like how you do the sort of theme park thing because like it's not a fun thing right no like refining like petrol refineries like i used to live near a sort of it wasn't it wasn't a like i used to live like an industrial in an industrial area where they sort of made there was like an asphalt factory right um and they did like the same was in the plot of the movie stalker that is yeah i used to live in an asphalt factory that's right yeah and uh uh like they did visits but it was sort of like yeah you can watch the people work but that's it i don't understand like
491.56 501.20 SPEAKER_06  what what could you do to make it they're gonna have a bunch of like fun science museum type interactive activities where you can throw big wheels around you know yeah i'm afraid i'm afraid no
501.20 527.72 SPEAKER_02  they've come up with and i've never seen saudi arabia propose to have the following list of things in an international destination oh boy uh they're going to have three hotels 11 fine dining restaurants shopping destination it's just so it's just like the same as everything else you're building you're building another mall a world-class marini yeah they're all the it's like like americans in burger
527.72 537.98 SPEAKER_06  is saudi in mall just i i'm really i'm really enjoying the idea of a saudi guy discovering on we for the first time being like what if it's just all marinas you know there's like there's like a sort
537.98 563.50 SPEAKER_01  of variety of american nostalgia that i've been seeing online quite recently where they're sort of like nostalgic for the 90s and the 2000s and it kind of goes like things like remember when you could like go to pizza hut and kfc and they'd always have like a new thing and your parents would take you and like it'd be really exciting and you don't have that anymore and like some guy in saudi is like well yeah it all happened in the mall and so we have to build more malls because we're sort of
563.50 569.60 SPEAKER_02  we must keep out whatever cultural rot happened in 2008 we assume it was because because they're like
569.60 578.86 SPEAKER_01  celebrating the heritage if they're celebrating heritage that way it's sort of like well who's who's heritage i don't i don't think anyone in saudi are like i guess you could say that you'd
578.86 591.90 SPEAKER_02  celebrate saudi arabia's oil and gas heritage by doing one of two things which is one going to the mall or two getting 20 guys to fly two planes into the world trade center basically well because
591.90 601.42 SPEAKER_04  they were mad that there wasn't a food court yeah that was the thing the world trade center was too boring it didn't have any luxury fine dining option i think they did i think there wasn't there
601.42 613.74 SPEAKER_02  probably was fine dining yeah just so much to like muhammadana no don't do it he's not yeah he was himself not saudi you have to call his like like a like the ultimate sort of planners of the whole thing
613.74 619.10 SPEAKER_04  yeah um calling his handler yeah being like you could have a beautiful meal at the top of tower
619.10 634.60 SPEAKER_02  windows of the world yeah windows on the world excuse me the rig will feature a wide variety of water activities including a diving center in addition to an amusement park a splash park an e-sports a splash park how is that splash park do not co-locate the e-sports center in the splash
634.60 641.30 SPEAKER_06  park i'll say that oh yeah world record for like fried gpus an immersive theater in a multi-purpose arena
641.30 669.38 SPEAKER_02  the rig will also celebrate the kingdom's rich oil and gas heritage by creating an exceptional and unique experience making it a must visit destination here's my favorite part about the rig and why i'm talking i there's like stuff that's happening in neom that i'm not talking about because it's like oh my god more hotels i'm not talking about it there is has to be always something special something different to get me to include an item in the saudi review corner are you listening mbs
669.38 681.76 SPEAKER_04  you got to keep up the creativity you can't just be phoning it in saying yeah yeah we're gonna build four restaurants on a mountain no it's got to be something crazy like really crazy yeah for example
681.76 689.62 SPEAKER_02  aquelum perfect yes fritzl theme park we're talking crazy that's what we want to see oh the fritzl theme
689.62 702.06 SPEAKER_04  park restaurant district is not great surely it'd be like an escape room yeah yeah jamal khashoggi 3000 piece 3d puzzle we want to see crazy technically you can do that one now only once
702.06 717.58 SPEAKER_02  though the project is we developed and here's the thing that's special about it the project will be developed by the oil park development company under the direction of its ceo raid and bakriji who brings more than 20 years of experience not in the theme park industry but in the oil and gas industry
717.58 733.98 SPEAKER_06  so wait they're running it through the oil rig department with an oil rig this is just going to be an oil rig you're just going to be able to like be able to go on the oil rig and like they'll be like do you want to check out the esports center while the guys like throw the big sort of metal like pipes around
733.98 740.42 SPEAKER_04  you yeah it's just like young wide-eyed kids they're like mister did you really work for a ramco and he's
740.42 829.78 SPEAKER_02  like that's right boy yeah it's the the idea of being like yeah the this must be like his retirement pro he must know something he must have a favor he can call in because like i'm tired of working in oil and gas i've always wanted to be a theme park impresario yes perfect take your 20 years of experience in oil and gas and run these water slides and an esports center and fine dining restaurants and hotel rooms while the nissan leaf was done in for traditional oil man like myself but now it's the era of the theme park um so anyway anyway uh that's the the saudi arabia's rig i just can't stop laughing at the rig i know i know well why don't i before we do the uh jarring change in tone um why don't i just say one more piece of news which is our ongoing monitoring of the uh twitter slash x situation uh as they have decided to if you recall right elon musk was like there's too many woke people doing like uh doing wokeness at twitter we need a global town square so that ideas can flow and community notes and all that stuff free speech absolution we can have the global town crier yes exactly so so uh unfortunately uh i'm afraid x has gone woke again and after a head of a congressional hearing on child safety has planned to restart a trust and safety team by hiring
829.78 861.40 SPEAKER_06  100 moderators yeah they've had to like put the cathedral back in they've had to hire a bunch of master masons to rebuild the cathedral which is a sort of unusual historical counterfactual of a cathedral that prevents child abuse this is gonna be gonna be awkward too for elon given that he did personally approve the kind of like twitter premium payouts to that right-wing influencer who got caught posting child pornography and unsuspended his account for him after that happened oh good yeah well
861.40 874.16 SPEAKER_02  well the i'm sure these are going to be uh unwoke twitter mods uh because they're all based in austin texas which is like the new based city for trads or whatever still pretty woke is the thing like
874.16 887.02 SPEAKER_04  austin still pretty woke um yeah i mean the thing is though that guy he was posting child pornography for like free speech reasons not for horny reasons this is what he literally claimed is that he said he was
887.02 892.44 SPEAKER_06  he had all of this child pornography in order to shock people into understanding how bad child
892.44 899.48 SPEAKER_02  pornography was he should be like he should leave the moderation team he understands not the chris langham
899.48 906.78 SPEAKER_04  i had i downloaded all this child pornography for day in order to submit it to the police
906.78 932.94 SPEAKER_02  i just downloaded it to delete it yeah that's right so uh jeers to elon musk as he continues to accidentally build the the company twitter used to have figures it out from first principles but still as hsbc offering a new product as volvo releasing a new car i have no idea but i do know some amazing blackhead tweezers and the best vibrating clit massager that is now a normal ad
932.94 943.08 SPEAKER_06  and not just under promoted tweets even the clit massagers are kind of gone they're too mainstream for twitter now you know you're into some like weird gang stalking shit now yeah and stuff like oh
943.08 948.58 SPEAKER_04  it's the podcast about space and you're like what so have you ever wondered about space and i'm like
948.58 981.78 SPEAKER_02  not really well anyway anyway with all of that i think now behind us i want to do the jarring change in tone uh as we talk about the events of the last several days the jut the uh judgment of the international court of justice uh and the ongoing attempt to uh delegitimize now uh the united nations relief and works agency for palestinian refugees in the in the near east or unwra that's another palestinian laugh fest we're gonna do yes it's yet another court that's gone woke yeah well india well
981.78 995.06 SPEAKER_06  depends who you are some say they've gone racist oh okay lawrence fox trying to like bang on the doors of the icj so they'll tell him whether or not he's racist we are busy south africa somehow
995.06 1002.22 SPEAKER_04  contriving to sue lawrence fox for child custody if south africa wants to indict lawrence fox in a sort
1002.22 1013.80 SPEAKER_06  of international humanitarian law situation i i already support them doing this i i would like do support too i would like throw some money at them i would give some money to the south africa go fund
1013.80 1018.78 SPEAKER_04  me at that point like for his own good basis like we're gonna put him in a treatment center
1018.78 1025.62 SPEAKER_02  that we're okay so basically uh we and we talked about sort of this before as it was coming up but
1025.62 1033.46 SPEAKER_06  racist to come out of a south african prison for human rights offenses so south africa has
1033.46 1039.34 SPEAKER_02  essentially brought a case before the icj suggesting uh alleging that israel is committing genocide in
1039.34 1048.52 SPEAKER_06  gaza yeah which is like plainly true everyone can see it you can see they submitted all the fucking tiktoks where the guys were like we are doing genocide big thumbs up genocide doesn't count if
1048.52 1054.18 SPEAKER_02  you're flossing so what happened is this is essentially to be understood as more or less
1054.18 1083.22 SPEAKER_06  the arraignment um it's the best they're trying to decide whether or not well they have now decided whether or not there is a plausible case to answer that israel is committing genocide uh and the answer is of course yes obviously uh what the south africans wanted was uh for israel to be ordered to stop all of their military operations which would have been as effective as when the icj ordered russia to stop invading ukraine but they wanted to to have the thing on paper for some of the ramifications we'll
1083.22 1089.04 SPEAKER_05  talk about later no court has gone woke i do not recognize this i think i think that's more or less
1089.04 1103.16 SPEAKER_06  it i only recognize one court in rural belarus what they got and said was like part of what they wanted which is the icj told israel it has to take all measures to prevent genocide from happening right
1103.16 1114.58 SPEAKER_02  and and that's but that's like that is sort of meaningful in a sense that sort of uh yeah well it's it's meaningful enough that it will inconvenience at least inconvenience people who
1114.58 1135.66 SPEAKER_06  are supporting well i i can talk about the ramifications a bit right so so like we we've alluded to this before right where international humanitarian law is this thing that like doesn't have force but also kind of does in some unexpected like downstream ways like obviously this is not going to affect anything the idf does right uh they are going to ignore it they've said they're going to
1135.66 1169.36 SPEAKER_02  ignore it they're quite happy to do that also just to jump in as well this isn't not just not going to affect what the idf does this also is specifically not going to affect what israeli politicians do as i believe 12 of the 25 members of the cabinet went to a more or less celebrating the ethnic cleansing of gaza conference the day after or several days after the ruling was handed down which basically i interpret as looking at the ruling and saying yes don't even put us in provisional measure measures we are doing it yeah absolutely they could have named that conference a little bit better it's it's
1169.36 1233.02 SPEAKER_06  it's not it's not enforceable in the sense that like obviously the like un isn't going to send troops to drop out of black helicopters and like in you know enforce a ceasefire in gaza what it does do is that there are a lot of states that have laws about enforcing bits of ihl and those are going to have effect in terms of like where israeli officials might be able to travel lest they be subject to like arrest warrants and stuff or uh what companies can sell what to israel because uh you know if you have a sort of a country that has a broadly uncontroversial law that's like you can't sell military material to like countries that are being investigated by the icj or whatever and no one really thinks about that too much at the time and all of a sudden it like catches one of your strategic allies you might find yourself as you know uh sweden or switzerland or whatever having to think very carefully about whether you should be doing business as usual with israel whether that's illegal and you would have to change your laws to do it it doesn't mean that they won't change these laws yeah but it requires you to like take that step sometimes um yeah it's it's embarrassing
1233.02 1242.76 SPEAKER_04  that looks a bit dodgy saying like no i'm just going to remove this provision about not selling arms to countries doing genocides because uh actually it's not convenient right now
1242.80 1260.60 SPEAKER_02  yeah and i think it's also worth worth saying that because the court um it's because the court didn't like didn't say at the arraignment yes by the way you're convicted of a genocide this was described as a kind of barnstorming victory for israel uh yeah which is which is sort of it doesn't
1260.60 1269.40 SPEAKER_04  really make sense because south africa won the case right like it's not like it's not like oh they they lost the case on some points or whatever it's like they won the case but like this is all you
1269.40 1317.12 SPEAKER_06  can get out of a case like that right yeah i mean the the israeli judge on the icj uh like uh agreed with like two of the points that south africa wanted for instance but yeah the sort of the israeli pr is uh sort of metronoming between totally exonerated and being the kind of like angriest you've ever seen and being like we are going to specifically not only ignore this not only do genocide and more but we are going to sort of revenge ourselves on this system of international institutions because the icj is the un's court what what does the un have that we can fuck with well we've already been killing a shitload of un relief and works agency employees uh we're gonna like accuse some of them of having participated in the october 7th attacks when we say employees we
1317.12 1327.62 SPEAKER_02  don't mean like strategic planners who are then like you know doing strategic planning of attacks one of the people accused was a cleaner like a janitor you're not killing the like dutch guy with
1327.62 1354.52 SPEAKER_06  the rimless glasses and like a bunch of people are sort of like now very seriously like self-seriously like jerking themselves off thinking about like well obviously unrwa has been infiltrated by hamas in some areas and it's like no it's the one of the largest employers in gaza if it's if it is compromised by hamas it's because hamas is governing gaza but so the the point of this the thrust of all of this is to destroy unrwa as an agency and that has led to like the us and the uk and a couple of others
1354.52 1381.24 SPEAKER_04  uh pulling funding from it temporarily yes because israel they don't they don't know how to like respond to anything in like a cool way you know like they had the option of just drinking a potent poison in the dock of the icj and that and everyone would have had to have respected that like look israel i may disagree with you on some things but that went pretty hard but you know what they just didn't have the source that slobber dan pralyak had r.i.p well like i have a more controversial
1381.24 1408.54 SPEAKER_06  take than this which is that like even first invasion of ukraine right when putin was still bothering to lie about it when he did the like we don't know who these guys are could be anybody you know could be just guys from military surplus that wasn't good but it was a little bit funny and yeah the polite people yeah exactly and israel doesn't even have that level of like dictator bullshit going on where it's able to be like who knows maybe go fuck yourself
1408.54 1458.82 SPEAKER_02  well so the this is that's why i think this is sort of significant as well as this is a moment where the international institutions that underpin and support the kind of like western-led hegemonic world order that we understand right we used to be able to like those institutions like the icj like these things are useful to create among other things the perception among nations of like ah yes there are laws those laws are enforceable it is not merely the rule of power and so on and so on even if it is it's kind of deniable enough like it serves an ideological purpose other international courts like investor state adjudication tribunals those serve a direct like neo-imperial purpose of extracting money from places of extracting resources from places regardless of the political objection it's
1458.82 1463.92 SPEAKER_06  like why does france control the currency system and currency reserves of so many african countries
1463.92 1488.80 SPEAKER_02  and all of these institutions exist to hold that up but you we have to now this goes back to understanding like you know netanyahu specifically is a kind of rogue garrison commander creating enormous problems for a metropole which is addicted to backing him at all costs it's like as if ed harrison the rock was just given more weapons and poison by the u.s government basically yeah i mean the thing is
1488.80 1586.22 SPEAKER_06  right riley and i we were talking about this um preparing for this episode and i think the thing that's been missing for a lot of this is a kind of historical analysis of zionism as colonialism where so much of this seems so weird because of this kind of displacement in time where zionism gets to do its sort of colonial movement relatively late very late by the standards of like european colonialism because of anti-semitism and so you have this kind of like 1890s through 1950s project of of colonialism where all of this stuff that exists now all of this kind of like international humanitarian law all of these international institutions exist because we did all of that stuff and then embedded it over generations right like even though it's still maintained violently today even though it's still exploitative today if you go to say for instance like the uk occupying northern ireland right that actually is like a generational thing of like something that started in the 16th century right if you try to do like land back in the u.s no one's taking manhattan back because it's just not feasible anymore whereas with israel you can you know people still have their old door keys right because it's that recent and we're in this mode now where israel is kind of using the the finest colonialism of like the pith helmet era right which is when you say yeah that's good that we're doing this we're happy we're doing this um and we should do more of this and it's scaring the absolute fuck out of everyone who is you know sort of like gotten to a managerial place with it
1586.22 1647.48 SPEAKER_02  sort of generations later well there's a there's there's a reason that the colonialism became neo colonialism yes yeah absolutely there's there's a reason that like we went cyberpunk well there's a reason that like the most the most important institutions of colonialism now yes the u.s military as a globe bestriding colossus is super super important but the other institutions such like the imf and world bank for example those are super important to what to basically taking the the global system that was created by european colonialism in the 19th century and then cementing it those systems keep that they're very conservative but they're all they're very they're very subtle they operate via things like contracts and agreements they operate through like uh through through lawsuits for example the case of investor state adjudication tribunals they're very legalistic they're very conservative they're they're the colonialism of the implicit threat of the gun behind the contract not just the gun even when you use the gun like even if france intervenes in africa
1647.48 1695.26 SPEAKER_06  all the fucking time like we we've had our like more than our fair share of post-colonial wars but the thing is that you have to lie about it and pretend to feel bad uh and israelis uh israeli politicians i think have an understanding of this as a double standard right that they're not wholly wrong about right like the big israeli the big zionist grievance here is all of you guys got to do this and now all of a sudden when it's our turn suddenly we're the assholes and it's like well yes because of european anti-semitism it was too late to do all of this stuff in a way that is embedded by now by the time when we invented this whole layer of ideology over it and so you guys are sort of a generation behind still doing the stuff that we at least have the kind of like ideology over it to
1695.26 1707.32 SPEAKER_02  lie about feeling bad about when we do it you arrive too late to do the initiation activity into the direct imperialist club and now you're trying to do it yourself outside yeah and the reason why it was
1707.32 1732.34 SPEAKER_06  like is a function of anti-semitism like there's a reason why theodore herzler is like writing to cecil rhodes back in the day being like let me do the colonialism shit let me do the shit that you're doing it will be cool please help me i promise it will be cool and getting completely like no sold is because all of these guys all of our original like genesee there's all of our colonialists were authentically very anti-semitic and we're like no i don't want to it also sort of seems to be
1732.34 1759.28 SPEAKER_01  a very bizarre situation where there are some like israeli politicians who are trying to like who do recognize that and are trying to sort of like keep what they're doing like somewhat subtle at least like how they're saying and they keep getting unset by like other israeli politicians and like all these people at these conferences who just seem to be like yeah we are going to fucking do the thing we are we're doing it we're saying the line and the line is like we're taking back guzz and turning it into like a big you know tourist tourist and falafel house right yeah the
1759.28 1762.88 SPEAKER_04  arm and van buren theme park that they're going to build on top of guzz and i do sort of wonder
1762.88 1784.36 SPEAKER_01  whether like part of what's happening right now because i imagine that like the european powers and all this sort of institutions probably wouldn't have acted this way as much had though had there been some sort of like political discipline among israeli politicians but the fact that so many of them and so much of political culture there is just insane kind of means that like they keep ruining
1784.36 1829.42 SPEAKER_06  the thing so i i think there's two things happening here right there's two reasons why that's the case there's two reasons why the israeli government is like so enthralled to the far right and the effect that that has on israeli public opinion um whichever order around you want to place that one is the thing that we just talked about that like starting late right and still having your your colonialism being in a place where it's not like embedded yet the other i think is all of the decisions that the west generally and more specifically the u.s have made to reward that to not back down off of that to help facilitate that at every turn to be like actually it's fine you can just like push us around because we feel bad enough that like do do whatever you know what's it's like the way i see it really
1829.42 1896.34 SPEAKER_02  is all this became you would never have gotten uh the oslo accords after the global war on terror starts basically because the global war on terror is like okay all right perfect we have a designated universal enemy it's all muslims and so they are now automatically to be treated with suspicion and fought and they and undermined at every turn and so they turned into israel is like okay well who's better at doing that than us and that's when that's why from like from 2000 looks like you come crawling back yeah who do you need your old friend israel from 2001 to 2000 like this is why i think that's up to 2008 and after you know they they get sort of so emboldened to eventually just understand that yes they are well they are a u.s client state right they're a stationary aircraft carrier in the mediterranean they can also when with regards to like doing whatever they want with their territory they can just get away with it because they were being sort of like nakedly supported for so long that there's just the way to there is no real tool left except for just cutting off support which will
1896.34 1991.38 SPEAKER_06  never happen yeah no absolutely and this is the thing i think you have to view it in part as a process of like running out the clock right of being like you get to a point where things are so embedded that you can do the thing that americans or like any other kind of like post-colonial society does of being like we now acknowledge that what we did was bad but it is no longer feasible for us to compensate you in a way that sort of like it measures up to the thing i'm sorry you know the uk cannot give barbados like four trillion pounds in reparations for slavery that kind of thing right i think a lot about the the israeli series fowder it's on netflix it's terrible but one of the things one of the things in it is the the hamas guy they're like big bad goes undercover to israel with with his other hamas boy and they go to tel aviv and they're on the beach in tel aviv and they go look at what they've built they're not going anywhere right and that's the end goal that that's the kind of like i think sublimated negotiated compromise ending that uh that's sort of like as much as the far right that's in control in israel now wants to just sort of bulldoze everything into the sea and have done with it um i think the sort of like unspoken liberal zionist thing is the compromise you come to is you seize everything you can you dispossess and you kill and you do all of this and then at some undefined point in the future the thing flips over to well we feel very badly but there's nothing we can do because we're just here now what do you want to do like demolish tel aviv of course not
1991.38 2005.76 SPEAKER_01  well yeah because i guess that vision is very much like you know the ultimate vision being that when they invite like taylor swift to do a gig in like gaza eventually she does like a land acknowledgement yeah yeah that's really like the best yeah yeah well there well this is the thing
2005.76 2016.22 SPEAKER_04  right i mean like because no one is actually suggesting this like no one no one remotely sensible is suggesting just like oh well all the israelis will have to leave yeah literally literally
2016.22 2021.48 SPEAKER_06  all a one state solution is is make the country make it one country that is a democracy
2021.48 2031.84 SPEAKER_02  yes that's it that is that is the that is the one state solution and which is objected to because they're like well obviously they would but then they would start voting which we can't allow
2031.84 2100.46 SPEAKER_01  yeah and this is also sort of telling because like whenever this and you can sort of see this with the labor party right now and they're sort of weird sort of sense of triangulation because a few weeks ago i from what i understood the policy was like we want a two-state solution and they didn't really elaborate from that point but you can sort of see now that like every time kist armor like david lammy is asked about this they like don't really elaborate and it kind of you know because i think there has to sort of be an awareness but like well you're you know you're dealing with like in the terms of reality but you're dealing with like yes one might be that like obviously any sort of you know the idea you know it goes back to our whole like you know to the river to the sea thing where um the way in which that has sort of been leveraged uh is one which implies that like oh if you say it then actually you just want to wipe out all the like you know all the israelis out of like that region which is which is never which isn't true and like has not really been true and like very serious like if you're talking about it seriously but nevertheless has sort of been leveraged to that point where you know to sort of say that now you all you are automatically like sort of assumed to do that at least among like certain media circles the other part though is that like it is sort of what's been recognized is that actually no the sort of consensus in israeli politics is one where like no a one-state
2100.46 2106.38 SPEAKER_02  solution can't happen they're not going to do it there is a one-state solution and it's israel takes it all
2106.38 2129.72 SPEAKER_01  right well that's it like a one-state solution they're doing it now and they're like river to the sea thing is like yes we will take the river to the sea thank you very much and i think like alice just sort of put it well which is like like the best case like liberal zionist position is well you know we'll apologize for it eventually and we'll sort of acknowledge it sort of eventually about doing a mournful flossing dance you're doing your genocide but you're shaking your head to
2129.72 2149.32 SPEAKER_02  show that you disagree here's the thing though right that whole plan is kind of scuppered by a finding that you are currently doing the genocide that is kind that is sort of other people have other countries have signed up to recognize sort of prima facie right and you know
2149.32 2157.58 SPEAKER_01  like you guys may have been following this more than me but is is the strategy just sort of like they just kind of hope that regardless of what happens now people will just sort of forget that
2157.58 2162.34 SPEAKER_06  it happened yeah yeah absolutely i mean i think the thing is right like i think that you can sort of
2162.34 2170.90 SPEAKER_01  be like turkey where it's just like you know the armenian genocide is something that's sort of in the background but you like punish your opponents enough that like well here's the thing right this
2170.90 2227.82 SPEAKER_06  of the the the far right zionist approach to this is there will be no one left to remember it and if they are they're going to be in fucking like sinai or australia or wherever and it won't matter the liberal zionist thing is in 200 years time some like woke students are going to try and pull down a statue of isma benkvir and everyone's going to like roll their eyes at them and the kind of the nightmare is if we're situating this in this kind of like colonialist scramble context right out of time being kicked out of the club like like leopold ii right and where you sort of offend the sensibilities of people with your genocide with your butchery to the point that they say that like no no this this is not only bad this is like representative of something that we are you know trying to avoid doing and they cut you off um and is that likely well not with joe biden in the white house but it you know i think the icj judgment is uncomfortably close to that yeah the icj judgment is kind of like a check
2227.82 2232.16 SPEAKER_04  engine light in your car you know you can ignore it but when you come to sell it it may raise the
2232.16 2282.28 SPEAKER_02  question yeah the what the icj judgment does even just provisional measures does is it forces it forces the people who the sort of the western leaders who sort of often talk out of both sides of their mouths and who are able to say you know very happily we support a international system of laws um and at the same time use that sort of universalist support for an international system of laws as a tool of neocolonialism right you could offer you could say wow an international system of laws when do we start the whole but the whole point of that right is it is a very very useful tool yeah for maintaining the sort of post-colonial state of affairs which is massively to the advantage of western countries yeah right which is which is again to be clear it's not good right
2282.28 2336.62 SPEAKER_06  we're not the the thing is right i think a lot of people um a lot of people's view of international humanitarian law specifically is that uh you know it's a dead letter now because israel is capable of doing this it can't be stopped you know it's sure as shit not stopping russia either and that's that's true to an extent but i think like i said there are weird sort of tendrils of it that help to perpetuate this kind of horrific in its own way liberal system and i think really it would have been had the court not responded in the way that it did had it like just dismissed the case entirely then then i think you could talk about it in those terms as it is i think it did kind of the bare minimum necessary to perpetuate that system and i think we're going to be seeing a lot more of that but as uh the israeli right does like more and more horrendous things i think the bare minimum what that is is going to be more and more and more and that's going to sort of like interfere with
2336.62 2378.30 SPEAKER_02  what israel wants to do more well one of the things that we talk about on this show a lot is systems of like political systems political institutions right and that sort and that very often sort of far right movements whether that is sort of national ones uh in in the uk or the us or like far right movements with like let's say whose actions have international ramifications like in like the israeli far right right who are consistently taking hacksaws to these institutions and it's not saying oh these institutions are good in themselves but rather you know you are in order to create political space for yourself you are hacking away at the support of the system of the structure that you're standing in
2378.30 2401.38 SPEAKER_04  yeah they're sawing at their own branch you know yeah yeah and also these things represent a kind of a like bare minimum you can say that they're not great a lot or like there should be more but it was a bit like with like brexit and people talking about like human rights and stuff and it's like yeah well the eu is not great on human rights but if you're refusing to conform to the eu's standards on human rights that doesn't tend to sound like you're going to do anything better yeah now now and what what
2401.38 2427.94 SPEAKER_02  what i'm talking about really though is uh that the that the beneficiaries of this system are having to now reckon with the fact that it's no longer fit for purpose because now you cannot you can't do what israel used to do right which is doing what it's doing but quieter and slower deniably right i always think of azerbaijan or not always because this happened recently but i think every day i always think of
2427.94 2434.48 SPEAKER_01  azerbaijan i wonder if he's thinking about other guys because it's like riley just picturing himself
2434.48 2453.70 SPEAKER_02  in like a koofy in the office that does sound cool but i think about azerbaijan and what azerbaijan has consistently done with nagorno-karabakh is they've said we don't want to move anyone we are happy with everyone staying where they are we're no threat to any we just want to govern it and while that may not
2453.70 2492.24 SPEAKER_06  be true no it's not at all but this is the thing it's like the the polite people thing right so long as you have the facade so long as you pretend that you're like being cautious about it or you feel even that you feel bad about it then there's a lot of leeway built into that system for that and i i think the thing the alarming thing the thing that's like really making liberals feel like you know christian scientists with appendicitis is that this seems to be like out of fashion now and that whether you are whether you're putin or whether you're netanyahu or anyone else you can just be like no it's fine we actually love this shit cope and seethe about it and so then and so now it's like
2492.24 2501.78 SPEAKER_02  if you're a i don't know if you're like um saab and you're making a new you know gripen jet you know you're having and maybe israel wants to buy a few you're looking at all the compliance required to sell
2501.78 2511.66 SPEAKER_03  them and you're like hang on a second is this actually worth it it's not good news for saab we're going to have to go back to making the 9.3 turbo which to be honest was a lot more sick than some of the
2511.66 2558.38 SPEAKER_02  stuff we're making now right but if you're if you're in that situation and then you have to think okay well how do we get all of these how do we how do we get this stuff to our ally who we're going to be sort of continuing to unconditionally support because this whole system of laws that we set up was just to support us doing this but it was support so it was to support us doing this in ways that were deniable and sellable um riley would you say that there's a sort of contradiction in the way these things are operating that's heightening i would say that and you know if you want to talk more about contradictions and these systems falling apart all you have to do is look again at what is happening to stuff the u.s is supposed to protect in the region like the red sea now the houthis are striking u.s flagged ships right yeah it seems like the airstrikes
2558.38 2564.34 SPEAKER_04  have not worked yeah huh crazy they've worked everywhere else they've been tried something that keeps
2564.34 2568.60 SPEAKER_06  one time they didn't work i mean what i assume is given that they they don't work probably going
2568.60 2583.52 SPEAKER_04  to stop doing them right like this is this is what i don't get if you want to stop the houthis attacking shipping in the red sea just like you know i'm leaving out give them give the houthis what they want just protect the shipping just you you have like the biggest navy in the world just use it to
2583.52 2594.70 SPEAKER_02  protect the actual ships but it's busy uh doing donuts in the south china sea i'm afraid oh okay what for captain tom yeah yeah yeah no there's that chinese are just hearing about
2594.70 2601.44 SPEAKER_04  captain tom due to the great firewall i hope they built this man a sauna he deserves it oh no well
2601.44 2670.90 SPEAKER_02  if they're just hearing about that now they're gonna have three joyous years of feeling as though captain tom's descendants got a sauna yeah that's right so so so so right but it's the same thing about again unspecified but like sort of claim to be iranian-backed militant groups striking american bases in jordan the west understands that it needs this to stop but it was also going to take no steps to compel it to stop because these are two equally powerful uh drives which is support support our allies against the barbarians under all circumstances especially against iran but also uh we cannot deal with these many escalations that are happening it is once again another it's not just contradictions heightening in the kind of ideological space of things like international law but it is contradictions heightening where the west recognizes that the west broadly speaking mostly the u.s recognizes that it's not really able to respond to the to all of what is going on either because it won't work or
2670.90 2721.78 SPEAKER_04  because it can't handle another escalation i saw um a very funny osint post about the attack in jordan because those guys are fascinating i think those guys are so funny for like saying the quiet part out loud because they pretty much not all of them but pretty much all of them have an incredibly uncritical like hillary clinton type worldview um like the most the most hawkish version of hillary clinton but yeah there's this post where he was like iran is struck at these u.s bases in jordan this is this is fully over the red line surely the u.s response to this has to be disproportionate and it's like he's spent so long commenting on this stuff that the what the meaning of the word disproportionate force has changed to him to mean a good amount of force because he's like well when people say proportionate that's always doing gay shit like not blowing up iran so surely well look like i mean on a very like
2721.78 2733.74 SPEAKER_01  logical level he needs war to happen for the content to keep keep being produced right it's his it's in his uh in what it's in their it's in their uh interest for the war to sort of keep happening sorry i misgendered
2733.74 2752.68 SPEAKER_02  the osin account for posting sorry i'm sorry if i misgendered any osin yeah uh non-binary osin so uh you'd be surprised yeah so anyway anyway right this is i got a good um quote from the intercept of pentagon deputy press secretary sabrina singh who said we do not think that we are at war right now
2752.68 2804.22 SPEAKER_06  cool okay that's very dr strange love isn't it i got this map in this territory um i mean this is the thing right i think we've talked about before how this kind of like economic mode of the u.s and the uk is shifting from i mean maybe not so much now but like is shifting to this kind of like productivist thing uh this kind of like wartime neoliberalism if you like and i think one of the reasons why is to accommodate the fact that due to there being absolutely no plan no desire to have a plan uh and no coherence whatsoever and everything being in the hands of one 90 year old man who says things like oh earth rider thanks for the great lakes it's just going to be crisis after crisis and it's going to lurch from from one to the other and yeah we're all kind of waiting for the the other shoe to drop in in taiwan you know however many years that takes and you know it comes back to
2804.22 2827.32 SPEAKER_02  we want to talk about um western states wanting understanding strategically that they need this to end but also strategically can do nothing to compel it to stop is you can look at what's going on uh with the proposals for peace that the uk david cameron a man who a couple days ago was announced as being under our lead diplomat is now under more investigation by the syrian's broad office
2827.32 2871.92 SPEAKER_06  cool well the obvious broad office busy the the thing about the october 7th attacks right was that in the aftermath of them there was this thing of like not only can there be no ceasefire because of you know the horrendous crimes of hamas right but it is now point blank immoral to talk to hamas to negotiate with hamas this this as israel was negotiating with hamas and i just had this brief wave of sympathy imagining the um the like the sis officer the british intelligence officer whose job is to sit in the like the salt bay restaurant in doha uh and spend most of their time talking to hamas be being instructed that like this is a sort of immoral thing for anyone to do you know well it's the uh
2871.92 2878.68 SPEAKER_02  we talk as well we've talked before even about this even about like israel as well i just i just think
2878.68 2898.38 SPEAKER_06  it speaks to the like fundamental like lack of seriousness you you should like invest in anyone telling you oh we could we don't negotiate with with you know x group but at the time this was said like fully like if you if you said that we should have ever talked to hamas about anything it meant that you were a hamas supporter while you know while the government was doing it so well i mean
2898.38 2935.70 SPEAKER_02  this is just because we fund hamas it goes it goes back to well i guess something we've talked about before a pattern we talked about i'll fund hamas but i won't speak to them they're just like my ex-wife it goes back to something we've been talking about before which is the the kind like elected politicians especially like your your standard like i don't know like a right-wing um right-wing labor mp is ends up being much more hawkish than anyone in the defense establishment yeah right because they because they are in a they have become so disconnected and this is true for any like
2935.70 2941.32 SPEAKER_06  90 year old guy who wants nothing more than to bomb iran yeah well this also this is also true for
2941.32 2974.56 SPEAKER_02  any sort of like you know um sort of mainstream democrat in the states but you know labor will sort of focus on is that the is that they are so removed right they are so removed from anything than just the appearance of toughness because when things are pretty much collapsing and have been more or less in free fall for kind of as long as most people can remember if you were born in the early 1990s anyway right then all you can do is promise to be tough on the causes of that the global war on terror unwinnable so all you could do is project constant toughness yeah every labor politician is
2974.56 2981.32 SPEAKER_00  like hair wet from the school toilets like i am tough hamas will never intimidate me not unless there's
2981.32 3007.94 SPEAKER_02  a toilet nearby that they can dunk my head in and so you again get situations where you're saying it is it is immoral to ever consider anything that would involve like negotiating with hamas who just controls that territory but at the same time everyone in the security establishment being like no no no we have to talk to them every day at the panda express in doha basically yeah because
3007.94 3015.04 SPEAKER_06  they're a government because they're like basically a state actor like yeah and and there is a lot of
3015.04 3021.00 SPEAKER_02  pay to be made in sort of global north politics in never recognizing that fact because that's backing
3021.00 3027.44 SPEAKER_06  down yeah we only have to recognize it at all the stuff that matters yeah exactly kim philby being
3027.44 3043.12 SPEAKER_04  louche at the pizza the fucking panda express in doha being like oh i suppose it's kung pao chicken again i miss working for the communists it was easier then do you do you like gay sex
3043.12 3060.68 SPEAKER_06  yeah imagining all of those people who are like how do you as an lgbc person like support palestinian rights don't you know that hamas would throw you off the roof or whatever and meanwhile hamas in doha talking to the most flagrantly homosexual british intelligence officer
3060.68 3081.88 SPEAKER_02  yet and that's a league table yes yeah the uk is proposing a five-point plan to end the war between israel and hamas as western allies that have backed the jewish state push for a permanent ceasefire in a political process that sets a pathway for the establishment of a palestinian state i didn't know that hamas had infiltrated so many international organizations such as the u.s
3081.88 3097.96 SPEAKER_06  the the u.s are hamas the un is hamas we are hamas i want to do that hamas isis thing but hamas us yeah but yeah the transitive property joe biden is in isis yeah ham ham usa which is actually a lobby
3097.96 3130.08 SPEAKER_02  group for the pork industry pledging by us my my sheik joe biden so the uk is proposing a five-point plan uh specifically so as qatar along the u.s and egypt is already mediating to broken agreement that leads to a pause and release the rest of the hostages um and so on but the talks have been bogged down by israel's rejection of hamas's demand for a permanent ceasefire at the end of any arrangement uh something mediators are also pushing for the heads of cia and massad were expected to hold talks the qatari prime minister on saturday in paris to break the deadlock and so this is and
3130.08 3135.30 SPEAKER_06  all of the pre-meetings between people who are like three layers of seniority under both of those
3135.30 3141.26 SPEAKER_04  people in like an otakos in chatelay talks were slowed down by the rapidity of the service at
3141.26 3154.06 SPEAKER_06  the doha panda express too much arguing about the bill you'd hate to be in the situation where you're about to negotiate a ceasefire and then salt bay comes over and starts doing the fucking act you know
3154.06 3160.22 SPEAKER_04  the taliban being like hang on a minute i only had a chow mein wait why is the taliban there
3160.22 3165.86 SPEAKER_06  so i'm not taliban on the break i mean this is the thing right doha is just kind of like this
3165.86 3171.18 SPEAKER_04  yeah to be fair the taliban are also in doha yeah they're at the next table over like yeah they're
3171.18 3184.20 SPEAKER_02  arguing with the pakistani intelligence so the um also how do you get a chow mein at uh salt bay anyway be in the taliban oh i was doing panda express okay so look yeah you're turning up with a
3184.20 3193.98 SPEAKER_04  fucking ak-74 like i wanted chow mein or i'll fuck you so so this is the uh but this is this
3193.98 3227.72 SPEAKER_02  the other thing right this is that all every single western um sort of backer of israel at least at like the diplomat level if not the presidential senile level understands that at this point the only way to permanently stop this fighting is through at least the creation of a palace like let's understand that like the one state solution where it just becomes a democracy with equal rights for everyone it's not possible and balkanization is the next best step the next best thing uh fine not not fine
3227.72 3232.74 SPEAKER_06  but that's that's the constraints of the ideology right yeah that that's what i mean yeah yeah israel
3232.74 3253.92 SPEAKER_02  invent bread you are dog people etc yes of course finally so the the understanding of but even that understanding once again is being scuppered by the fact that no one will acknowledge that a create that they netanyahu says no we will never acknowledge the creation of a palestinian state we will not work with it will not acknowledge any kind of permanent ceasefire even if the host is
3253.92 3296.44 SPEAKER_06  like this is on his pith helmet shit right he's playing victoria 3 while the rest of us are playing i i don't know hearts of mine probably now he's playing age of empires too yeah kind of like i mean this is the thing right uh no uh sort of like european colonialist of the sort of late 19th early 20th century would concede anything in this way uh unless like forced to by like force of arms right and so neither will he despite the fact that he's like a guy from pennsylvania like yeah mr netanyahu was quoted as saying would please if him as simply invents the monk you know they can convert whole
3296.44 3301.64 SPEAKER_04  idf divisions or if they complete their wonder they could snatch victory from the jewels of defeat
3301.64 3385.50 SPEAKER_02  so let's take all of what we've been saying about the commitment i think on the part of the israeli government to commit a genocide and the fact that it's only and that we're only willing to stop try and stop them by asking them basically right then come back around to okay well where does that leave the countries who have long support who long supported what is likely to be found legally a commission the commission of a genocide where does that even leave like public perception like for example like uh the labor party suspending kate ossemoor um for uh acknowledging on holocaust remembrance day like other more recent genocides including gaza in that list which is now found plausibly to be a genocide right this is just immediately suspending her the u.n the compromise guys and the most compromised bit of that whole institution yeah this is but the suspension of her as a labor mp again for the appearance of toughness for toughness's sake by the part where does that leave all these people i i i don't know right i don't know where that's going to leave all of them but what's going to happen is that because of all of this the system of international law the system of the neo-colonial set of institutions that are designed to be very conservative that are designed to make it all tick make the bad thing tick over smoothly this is a they're they're going to at least some of them are
3385.50 3389.42 SPEAKER_06  going to be ripping themselves apart it's inevitable would you say that we are in the belly of this
3389.42 3419.76 SPEAKER_04  machine and the machine is bleeding to death yeah well it seems as though like you know the coconuts of the coconut shy are glued onto the sticks but someone has successfully managed to knock one of the coconuts off with a ball and no one's sure what to do remember when kamala harris said this yeah people are thinking about like you know is the institution of the coconut shy important do we need to give out one prize in the history of the coconut shy or do we just burn the entire fair to the ground and it seems to be they're going with the second one which is interesting yeah so like what's what's
3419.76 3527.48 SPEAKER_02  going to happen like and i'm not so naive as to say what's going to happen is that as as more and more evidence piles up which again israeli right-wing politicians are doing i think on purpose right absolutely they're not really covering it up are they oh doing on purpose right or at least i think on purpose uh i'm not so naive as to think that i don't know keir starmer is going to have a sudden change of heart i mean why would he he's uh from an unrelated profession by three ghosts well he's from an unrelated profession before he got into politics i think he was a tool maker yeah i think so i haven't checked you know yeah anyway i welcome the false ghost no though i i sort of get back to what i was saying i'm not so naive to think that this is going to cause some kind of that a legal finding is going to cause some kind of sea change in what western countries do i'm also not so naive to think that public opinion is really that important however for people who consider that kind of let's say or public opinion not that important because the people who are in power largely ignore it um but for people who consider it important still to manufacture consent where does that leave them when they basically i don't know you could say the equivalent in the 1990s would be keir starmer wearing a shirt that says who to power basically you know where does that leave you if you consider that to be important i don't know the answer do you just ignore it do you pretend it didn't happen do you just say oh the u.n's woke we're going to do away with it and do you just rebuild it from first principles what do you rebuild who rebuilds it it's it does it's these things can break it just seems that they're being broken largely from the inside by the beneficiaries of them who are sort of don't understand that they're
3527.48 3532.64 SPEAKER_04  the beneficiaries of them jeremy corbyn's thrown out of the labor party for having too many tootsie
3532.64 3560.72 SPEAKER_02  sympathies right so i don't know the answer to that question no neither do i um oh well i suppose the new is struggling to be born yes slouching towards where again anyway anyway uh i think that's probably all we have time for so i want to once again thank everybody for listening for being bonus subscribers um it's a free one isn't it nope it's a bonus one it's monday but it was but it was so
