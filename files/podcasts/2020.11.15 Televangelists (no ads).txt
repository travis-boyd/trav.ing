On this season, we'll be covering our vehicles of hysteria, how pop culture and the media
shape our psychology and society, and how our national mythologies manipulate the realities
we share, and sometimes the realities we don't.
I'm your host, Chelsea Weber-Smith, and this is American Hysteria.
And now, speaking for Christ and against communism.
I want you to get out the largest bill that you have right now.
And I said, because I was faithful, God's now given me a Cadillac. Hallelujah.
The news anchors will be amazed at how great America is, because God is great in America again.
In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
You've probably made fun of them in the uncanniness of their makeuped faces and sculpted hair.
You've probably mimicked their accents and parroted their more outrageous, incendiary claims in their
toothy, empty promises and slew of suspect miracles.
Maybe you've been disgusted at their hypocrisy and reveled in the financial and sexual scandals that brought their flashy empires crashing to the ground.
Or maybe you've been genuinely angry at them, furious at them, watching a family member conned out of their hard-earned money,
while at the same time growing more radical in particular kinds of political beliefs that are now so aligned with the celebrity Christianity.
Televangelists, in all their fiery, outdated pomp, are easy to not take seriously, especially now.
But the influence of prominent and patriotic white evangelicals in American politics has been enormous since the foundation of the moral majority in the early 1970s,
with unnerving roots that seem long forgotten, covered up in the stories they preach of societal decay, abortion, gay marriage, and more specifically for cranky elf Pat Robertson, lesbian witchcraft.
But for millions, these figures still hold the promise of a better life through what is known as the prosperity gospel,
convincing viewers that the generosity of their donations will return to them tenfold in fantastical financial ways.
Because, as they command, spreading the gospel through these particular vessels of God is the best thing you can do for your fellow American.
Since the financial prosperity of the 1950s, money has become an ultimate expression of God's favor.
And of course, I could quote Bible verses all day that really paint these flashy kings and queens and the rich at large in a pretty bad light.
But by now, that's all part of the parody.
So here he is, the new American Jesus Christ, dripping in diamonds and fur,
long hair flowing in the breeze as he drives a Rolls Royce to a seaside mansion,
ready to wipe the day's makeup from his holy face.
Because, as televangelist Jim Baker once said,
I believe that if Jesus were alive today, he would be on TV.
Tammy Faye Baker seems to be remembered by those who weren't her fans as a ridiculous woman
with clownishly exaggerated makeup, cartoonish blonde hair, breast implants, loud outfits,
and a high-pitched voice she often used to call and sing out happily to the Lord.
She was a kind of peak Christian celebrity, along with her showbiz partner and husband, Jim Baker.
After meeting in college, the two discovered they shared a love of performing for Christ,
and they dropped out and went touring the Revival Tent Circuit in the 1960s
with Tammy's quirky songs and elaborate theater sets,
which added up to a far more immersive Christian experience.
The evangelical power couple would begin their TV empire in 1966
on Pat Robertson's new Christian Broadcasting Network
with a modest little puppet show aimed at warming children to the blood of Christ.
Their popularity would increase rapidly,
and come 1974, the two would branch out on their own
to create a worldwide Christian satellite cable network they called PTL,
standing for both Praise the Lord and People That Love,
but soon known to critics as Pass the Lute.
And Tammy began flaunting it, wearing mink coats with designer purses,
her and Jim riding in Cadillac limos, going on lavish Hawaiian vacations,
living in several mansions, and owning, most often cited, an air-conditioned doghouse.
Tammy Faye and Jim had mastered a rising scheme,
taking in tax-deductible donations from their TV congregations and in-person services,
while also being allowed a religious tax exemption.
The assumed reason for this religious tax exemption
is that these organizations, like nonprofits,
fill a role that the federal government would otherwise have to,
serving their communities through charitable works.
While many churches did and do fulfill that promise,
the looseness of the law's rules left much up for interpretation
of what exactly a religious institution was
and what they were allowed to do and not do
while benefiting from the federal government.
And we put this just beginning
And we'll show you the way
Making melodies for families
And carry to USA
The tax-deductible and tax-exempt donations of the Baker's shows
would eventually be shifted to building and maintaining
the third most popular theme park in the nation,
just behind Disney World and Disneyland,
attracting 6 million annual visitors to its South Carolina location.
Called Heritage USA,
It was 10 times the size of Disneyland,
with a 501-room grand hotel,
a huge indoor mall,
a golf course,
an amphitheater,
a skating rink,
churches,
Bible schools,
timeshares,
a 400-unit campground,
an RV park,
condos for permanent residents,
a water park complete with the world's largest wave pool,
and television studios,
where they filmed all their PTL shows.
There were plays that depicted Jesus' death with special effects,
and you could even have the experience of shopping in a fake Jerusalem marketplace.
The PTL Club would play testimonials from Heritage USA's mythic Upper Room,
a full replica of the alleged location of the Last Supper and the Pentecost,
open 24 hours a day,
where people could come and have their psychic and physical ailments cured,
and even, as one event promised,
delivered from the practice of witchcraft on Halloween night.
But Jim Baker had demons of his own to worry about come 1987,
when he would step down from his position as head of PTL and Heritage USA,
when a former church secretary accused him of raping her several years before,
and it was subsequently revealed that she had been paid almost $280,000 of PTL donations to keep quiet.
Jim would only ever admit to a consensual affair,
but that was enough to get the ball rolling.
By the 1980s, the market for televangelism was skyrocketing,
and the game was starting to look a little more like the movie Mean Girls than a ministry,
as a pop preacher named John Ankenberg dug around for some gay dirt,
soon announcing Baker as not only having an extramarital affair,
but also as a homosexual that sleeps with prostitutes.
And who would come to the rescue but longtime friend Jerry Falwell Sr.,
who would generously step in as a temporary company head,
just for a couple weeks, he said,
to help move the couple through the scandal as smoothly as possible,
so that they could be reinstated.
However, new it girl Jerry Falwell would stab Jim and Tammy in the back almost immediately,
calling his former BFF,
The greatest scab and cancer on the face of Christianity in 2,000 years of church history.
With all that drama out of the way,
but with donations dwindling quickly and surprise debts popping up,
Jerry Sr. had to sparkle up that tainted brand and fast.
In an allegedly funny publicity stunt,
Jerry made a promise to viewers that he would go down the big water slide at Heritage USA,
wearing a full suit and tie if they fulfilled the goal.
Oh, Jerry, you're so crazy.
The congregation would raise a whopping $20 million during the fundraiser to save God's own Disneyland,
and Jerry would take that long, allegedly hilarious slide,
the water spraying around his suit like a biblical aura,
the patron saint of the rising evangelical industrial complex.
$20 million wasn't worth it.
I don't know.
Oh!
Oh!
It's cold.
I'm ready.
I'm ready.
I'm ready.
With circus tents at its center,
what's sometimes been called the Fourth Great Awakening
was spreading through the nation
as events known as revivals
traveled the country in the 40s, 50s, and 60s,
surrounded by small fairs with food stands and live music
that could draw in thousands.
The charismatic preachers held inside these circus tents,
sometimes spoke in tongues,
induced ecstatic states in the audience,
and healed the sick right there alive.
They spoke and shouted and sang out in the language of what is called the prosperity gospel.
The promise that donations to these preachers
and their mission of spreading the word of God in any way they see fit
would return to the donor tenfold in miraculous and usually financial ways.
This idea, which we explored in depth in our episode called Get Rich Quick,
was convenient in that it also set up celebrity preachers
as men living in God's favor because of their flagrant displays of wealth.
It was proof that they had paid their dues to the Lord.
But on the flip side of the prosperity gospel
is the idea that those who are poor in material wealth
are also poor in spirit,
needing spiritual help only,
not charity,
to lift themselves out of their self-created poverty.
These solicited donations were called seed money.
You know, if you planted these little seeds,
eventually brand new Cadillacs would sprout up from the ground.
For these exciting spiritual circuses that just appeared one day as if by magic in each small town,
audiences were ready to dole out the cash.
And as you might imagine,
like all of us,
they loved a gimmick.
And they got one in a prolific, charismatic preacher standing not four feet tall.
Oh, my friend, listen to me.
There are people in hell that would give the universe,
if they had your chance,
if they had your opportunity,
too late, too late.
Hugh Marge Ross Gortner was born in 1944
and would be ordained as a preacher just four years later,
making him the youngest in history
and by far the cutest.
Like Cher, he just went by Margeau.
That is, a combination of the names Mary and Joseph.
And he was from an influential evangelical family that spanned generations.
His mother Marge,
who was described as exuberant,
saw something special in her little boy.
Margeau seemed to have no shyness to speak of
and a talent for memorization and public speaking.
His parents would go on to claim that as a toddler,
Margeau had received a vision in the bathtub
of God telling him that he needed to spread his message far and wide
and he needed to do it with a little pizzazz.
And so he began performing sermons with an adorable flair,
almost like a little pageant boy,
but also with an unnerving intensity,
with dramatic gestures and a lot of shouting about hell and the devil,
about the great spiritual war between good and evil.
Most famously, Margeau would officiate a wedding,
a publicity stunt that both Life and Paramount Studios were invited to attend.
Then his parents started teaching him the most important part of this whole shebang,
how to wrestle money from the fawning, singing, sometimes fainting crowd.
For example, he'd hawk allegedly holy items that could heal the sick and prevent people from dying.
Margeau continued this act on the circuit for years,
and by the time he was a teenager,
he estimated that he had made his parents about $3 million,
which, adjusted for inflation, would be in the ballpark of $20 million.
Unsurprisingly, and in classic child star fashion,
he would not see a penny of it.
Behind the scenes, Margeau was suffering from a hellish stage mom,
one who, sometimes along with his father, used emotional abuse,
held pillows over his face,
and even held him underwater until he got his whole act just right.
They never beat him, Margeau said later,
because they didn't want the bruises to show.
At 16, Margeau was done,
easily admitting that there had been no Christly visitation in that childhood bathtub,
and that even as a four-year-old boy, he had never believed in God.
He packed a bag and ran away to an opposite kind of life,
where else but to join the emerging hippie movement in Golden, California,
that liberal snake pit to the rising Christian right,
who were ready, finally, to break their long-held tradition
of staying out of the ungodliness of politics.
But with this rising tide of liberalism,
the Great Spiritual War got political.
During the civil rights battles of the 1950s and 60s,
two evangelicals, both named Billy,
would rise to prominence with very different approaches
to their religion and politics.
First, there was Billy Graham,
likely the most prolific preacher in world history,
reaching an estimated 2.5 billion people during his long career.
Billy Graham was controversial for his ecumenism,
that is, his unifying messages to all denominations to come together under Jesus.
But he was also loved for that same reason,
his soft charisma and positive, uplifting messages to the people.
But as you might guess, he was also strongly homophobic,
anti-women's rights and anti-Semitic at various points,
and originally supported segregation.
However, the man slowly changed his mind,
at least on that last point.
And then, he went out swinging.
In New York, Mr. Billy Graham makes a dramatic denunciation.
There's something wrong with human nature.
What is it in the nature of men that causes men to lie and hate
and have pride and bigotry and intolerance and racial intolerance?
What is it that causes men to have these terrible things down inside of them?
In 1953, Billy Graham performatively and controversially
removed the barriers between the white and black seating sections of his church,
taking a firm stance as he threatened to abandon
the religious revival movement as a whole
if they did not start supporting integration.
In 1957, Graham asked Dr. Martin Luther King
to join him for his 16-week revival,
where 2.3 million people would watch them preach
in places like Madison Square Garden,
Yankee Stadium, and Times Square.
Graham's influence was enormous,
both in the religious world and in the political world,
as he was spiritual advisor for every president
from Harry Truman, the 33rd,
to Barack Obama, the 44th,
trying to hold up his principle of bipartisanship,
which, for the most part, he did,
save for a little foray into Nixon territory.
Now, I'm not singing Billy Graham's praises,
because there is certainly a lot to criticize in the man,
but it's worth comparing him to another popular
evangelical radio and TV preacher,
another Billy.
Billy Hargis was one of the first televangelists
to really make that concerted jump into politics,
creating an organization in 1950
called the Christian Crusade,
which took a more hard-line approach
to biblico-political issues.
He was an avid segregationalist
who hated Martin Luther King,
accusing him in his book,
The Martin Luther King Story,
of being indoctrinated into radical communism,
helping to overthrow the American democracy.
And now, speaking for Christ and against communism,
here is Billy James Hargis.
While the deadly enemies of the American people close in
for their final stages of encircling our nation,
enemy nations within intensify efforts
to chip away the foundations upon which American freedom rests.
Hargis would soon meet a new BFF,
who would prove the perfect vitriolic patriot
to match his fire-and-brimstone Christianity.
Edwin Walker had been a decorated general in World War II
and a staunch anti-communist, anti-unionist, and segregationalist.
The two would hit it off profoundly,
and together they would devise a national tour
to get their patriotic Christian message out,
calling it, kind of ominously,
the Midnight Ride.
It was put in no uncertain terms
that they wanted to, quote,
alert the American public of the enemy from without
and the enemy from within.
You know, the liberal dictatorship,
the infiltration of academia and Hollywood
by communist forces,
and they even preached about,
that's right,
the mind control of fluoridated water.
In the big picture,
they presented communism as,
essentially, Satan,
and America as Jesus Christ.
Before joining forces with Hargis,
Walker had helped to lead the Ole Miss Riot of 1963
in protest against the first black person
admitted to the University of Mississippi,
activist James Meredith,
who hoped that his action would put more pressure
on the JFK administration to advance civil rights.
Supported by a raging Governor Rod Barnett
in opposition to federal interference,
the town surrounding the university
saw bands of cars and trucks
flying Confederate flags
with signs that said,
the South shall rise again,
targeting black residents with threats and violence.
It culminated in a massive riot
of 3,000 students,
led in part by Walker,
who had also been inciting them
through his radio program.
Mississippi,
it is time to move.
We have talked,
listened,
and been pushed around
far too much
by the anti-Christ Supreme Court.
As they destroyed buildings
they thought he might be hiding out in,
30,000 federal troops
would be called to protect James Meredith
and try to quell the property destruction.
Two people were killed,
hundreds injured,
rocks and bottles were thrown,
and shots were fired at police and civilians.
Regardless,
Hargis wanted Edwin Walker
on this epic American road trip with him
so they could begin their new mission
of preaching politics.
Each night was a kind of flamboyant play
centered on a stage
in front of 40 American flags.
Hargis was a gifted speaker in his right,
mopping the sweat off his forehead
while he mesmerized the crowd
with his wild gestures
and his unbridled passion.
Walker, however,
usually just sat awkwardly
in a chair beside the podium,
smoking menthols
with absolutely no expression on his face.
His speeches that came after
were far less effective,
to say the least,
but his identity as a war hero
and staunch patriot
helped weave together
several valuable cultural ideologies
and anxieties of the moment,
intense anti-communism,
fervent evangelicalism,
and distrust of the federal government.
It turned out that Hargis
was not unlike his friend Edwin Walker,
and it was discovered
by said federal government
that the Ku Klux Klan
had funded the midnight ride
in both South Carolina
and Arkansas,
with the investigation
stretching into Hargis' potential role
in the Alabama bombings.
But no charges were ever filed.
Through the use of male-solicited seed money,
Hargis would eventually be netting
the equivalent of $4 million a year,
all tax-exempt and tax-deductible.
His organization, however,
would be disqualified from this status
because of their very clear political dealings,
breaking one of the few cardinal rules
of religious tax exemption.
This wasn't just a problem
for Billy Hargis, however,
and this right to exercise religious freedom
while benefiting from federal funds
would become a rallying point
for the most powerful evangelical players
right into the present day.
In 1973,
another right-wing religious political activist
and commentator named Paul Weyrich
founded the Heritage Foundation,
a conservative think tank created explicitly
to address liberal policies of taxation.
And then he founded the Committee
for the Survival of a Free Congress,
which worked to train conservative activists,
fund conservative causes,
and support conservative candidates.
The CSFC invited Laszlo Pazder
into the organization,
and he would become Weyrich's right-hand man.
Weyrich seemed to overlook the fact
that Pazder was the former leader
of the Arrow Cross Party in Hungary
that had collaborated with Hitler
during World War II.
Pazder had served just two years in prison in Hungary
before traveling to the United States in the 1950s,
hoping to continue the fight against communism
and to help guide the Cold War efforts.
He worked his way into the ethnic outreach arm
of the Republican National Committee,
and by 1968, he turned it into a permanent unit
called the Republican Heritage Group's Council,
where he recruited Pazder and a handful of others
who would be integrated, perhaps unknowingly,
into government positions,
up until the administration of George Bush Sr.,
when a handful of these high-up officials
would be forced to resign
after they were exposed as former Nazi collaborators.
In addition to working closely
with the former leader of the Arrow Cross Party in Hungary,
Paul Weyrich also teamed up with Jerry Falwell Sr.
to create, drumroll please,
the Moral Majority.
In fact, Weyrich even coined the term.
This handful of evangelical influencers
that would pull together to form the Moral Majority
were reacting to a 1970 Supreme Court and IRS decision
that private schools that still practice segregation
would no longer be eligible for their tax-exempt status,
17 years after Brown v.
The Board of Education ordered the integration of public schools.
This caused outrage among evangelicals
who felt that their religious freedom to segregate
was coming under attack,
and this threat to take away their government benefits
was the last straw of 1970s liberalism
and the final nail in the coffin
of the evangelical value of staying out of politics.
This landmark case centered around a university
called Bob Jones,
the most prominent Christian college in America,
but it also applied to Jerry Falwell's private
Liberty University in Virginia.
For these two colleges,
as well as for most white Christian private schools in general,
segregation had been a backbone of policy and ideology,
as Bob Jones Sr. himself put it
in a 1920s Easter Sunday address
called Is Segregation Scriptural?
His conclusion went,
If you are against racial segregation,
then you are against God Almighty.
This had been a belief in American culture
all the way back to the 1600s,
and throughout history,
preachers had used ridiculous biblical interpretations
to support slavery, Jim Crow laws,
and then racial segregation.
The court battle over this infringement
on what they called religious freedom
would last for more than a decade.
And in 1975,
as the IRS was putting pressure on the university again,
they would finally change their policies
to officially admit black students,
but only those that were already married
out of fear of racial mixing.
Any interracial dating of the student body,
or any affiliation with any group
that supported interracial relationships
would lead to immediate expulsion.
In order to not bend to the federal government's will,
they would lose their tax-exempt status.
And Bob Jones University would keep their ban
on interracial dating all the way
until the year 2000.
If you're like me,
you kind of assumed that the moral majority,
that is, the Christian right,
started as a reaction
to the advancement of gay rights
and other gay, liberal, feminist,
witchcraft signs of social decay,
but most prominently,
the evils of abortion.
The fact that I thought this to be true
is not a coincidence.
And Weirich himself would admit
that the moral majority's
sudden anti-abortion rallying cry
was simply a sensational kind of moral crusade
that could easily cloak their real agenda.
Contrary to popular belief,
prior to the late 1970s,
abortion was not high on the list
of evangelical grievances,
largely considered a Catholic issue.
Though Roe v. Wade would cause a minor stir,
it would be a footnote
compared to the unbridled passion
of the next several decades.
It all started with a preacher,
sometimes called the intellectual godfather
of the Christian right,
Francis A. Schaefer,
who created a series of anti-abortion films,
the first of its kind.
Teaming up with pediatric surgeon C. Everett Koop,
the pair toured the country
with graphic and emotional media
that promoted the idea
that abortion would lead,
inevitably,
to the mass killing of live babies.
Whatever happened to the human race
is being washed down the sink drains
with the murdered remains
of the unborn babies
in today's hospitals.
One scene shows, dramatically,
a bunch of plastic baby dolls
lying, presumably deceased,
on the shores of the Dead Sea.
Evangelicals all over the nation
were hearing the message
that little babies
were being satanically,
brutally slaughtered
by liberals of all stripes,
which, as we know,
has always been a potent piece
of atrocity propaganda.
This tour would influence
our political landscape
up until the present day,
as the religious right
flexed their muscle power again,
sending sympathetic evangelicals
en masse to the polls.
Many in this crusade
started calling themselves
the new abolitionists,
a contradiction
that could not be more
nauseatingly stark
when we know
the underlying history.
The moral majority
would see their first
major political victory
in 1980
with the election
of Ronald Reagan,
whose policies would take shape
in part through this powerful lobby.
Now, I realize it's fashionable
in some circles
to believe that
no one in government
should encourage others
to read the Bible.
That we're told
that we'll violate
the constitutional separation
of church and state
established by the founding fathers
in the First Amendment.
The First Amendment
was not written
to protect people
and their laws
from religious values.
It was written
to protect those values
from government tyranny.
As governor of California,
Reagan had passed
the most liberal abortion law
in the state
in the late 1960s,
but 13 years later,
likely at the encouragement
of the moral majority,
he became
the anti-abortion
presidential candidate,
vowing and eventually fighting
to overturn Roe v. Wade.
And then in 1982,
with eyes on that
long-term prize,
the moral majority
came incredibly close
to a victory
for their underlying goal,
as the Reagan administration
attempted to reverse
the IRS policy
and restore tax exemption
for schools
with varying racial policies.
At the announcement
of the reversal, however,
civil rights groups
sounded the alarm,
and Reagan was forced
to reverse his position
yet again,
causing many
on the evangelical right
to accuse him
of betrayal.
Cranky elf
and moral majority fixture
Pat Robertson
would make an unsuccessful bid
at president
in 1988,
hoping to fill in
the Reagan void
with an even more extreme version
of the Christian right,
as he also made a killing
repackaging stories
of the Jewish Illuminati
and stoking the satanic panic,
pushing sensational stories
of the gay agenda.
All episodes you should listen to
for more great
televangelist content.
Pat's favorite
satanic scapegoat
became feminine gay men
and butch lesbians,
usually lesbian witches,
yet again using
shaky biblical interpretations
to justify discrimination.
Pat Robertson also claimed
that gays were using
blood-dipped rings
that could prick the finger
of any good straight white Christian
if they were just
shaking hands innocently,
infecting them with AIDS,
just because they were evil enough
to want to do something like that.
Following suit,
Jerry Falwell would call AIDS
the gay plague,
while televangelists
also painted homosexuals
as pedophiles
recruiting Christian children
in public schools
into their depraved lifestyles.
Like they did
for the issue of abortion,
members of the moral majority
would also create
and distribute
suspiciously explicit videos
explaining gay male practices
that would eventually
be watched by those
in the highest levels
of government.
But by the late 1980s,
televangelists would take
a serious hit
to their political
and social power
as several high-profile scandals
rocked their credibility.
Billy Hargis,
who you'll remember
as that political preacher,
would be outed
for a sexual relationship
he had with five students,
both women and men.
Not long after,
his partner in crime,
Edwin Walker,
would be arrested
for public lewdness
in a Dallas Park bathroom
for fondling and propositioning
a male undercover cop.
It happened again
the next year.
There are many more,
of course,
including the most famous
of all,
Jim Bakers,
not for his sexual transgressions,
but instead
for the serious accounting fraud
he committed
in the late 80s,
when it was discovered,
unsurprisingly,
that he'd been funneling
millions of tax-exempt donations
into his personal bank account.
Tammy Faye, however,
would never be indicted
on any charges.
Televangelists would shoulder
through the Clinton administration
until they got their next ally
in George W. Bush
and they worked side-by-side
on the whole
sanctity of marriage thing.
But these megastars
would seriously lose
political favor
during the progressive
Obama administration
as marriage equality
was finally passed federally
until evangelists
were relegated
to the backseat
of the political conversation.
But as we've seen
in the last five years,
evangelical entertainment
found a perfect partner
in Donald Trump
who would run
on the familiar platform
of apocalyptic others
and the prosperity gospel
his family had long
believed in religiously,
but without so much
of the religion involved.
Trump had already
been cemented
as a possible prosperity
president
in the American psyche
by his long history
of cartoon wealth.
But elite evangelicals
found in him
a love of money
and a passion,
it seems,
for tax evasion.
And also,
the kind of fiery,
unapologetic rhetoric
that railed
against liberal
political correctness
and at its very heart,
communism.
One by one,
prominent evangelicals
endorsed Donald J. Trump
for president,
led by the now disgraced
Jerry Falwell Jr.,
who, as most of us
have probably heard,
recently got caught up
in a sex scandal
of his own
with the pool boy,
involving both him
and his wife,
forcing him to step down
as head of his father's
Liberty University.
Jerry Jr. would soon
be followed
by a whole bunch
of other major
next-gen
evangelical figures
like Franklin Graham,
son of Billy Graham,
who was a prolific
Obama birther
conspiracy theorist,
which led him
to admire Donald Trump.
Billy Graham,
however,
would never endorse
Donald Trump,
and he also refused
to align himself
with his son's
more inflammatory opinions.
After sowing the seeds
of their endorsements,
all they could do
was wait.
But they would not
be disappointed
when exit polls
showed that 80%
of white evangelicals
voted for Donald Trump
in the 2016 election.
And like Reagan,
he got to work right away,
revoking the Obama-era directive
that defined discrimination
against the law
as also applying
to the LGBTQ plus community,
which was taken
as a serious threat
to the tax status
of religious schools
who refused to admit
these students
because of their sexual orientation
or gender identity.
Trump would also go on
to reinstate
the tax-exempt status
of a now-reformed
Bob Jones University.
We break and divide
every demonic confederacy
against the election,
against America,
against that who you have declared
to be in the White House.
We break it up
in the name of Jesus.
We lose confusion
into every demonic confederacy
directed right now
at this election.
That was Paula White
the day after the election,
a pretty blonde televangelist
investigated in 2011
for using donations
to pay for a mansion
in private jet.
She refused to cooperate
with that investigation.
She's been credited
with saving Donald Trump
single-handedly
when they became friends
in the 2000s.
As she tells it,
he asked for her blessing
to run for president,
saying,
Would you bring some people,
some really great people
around me to pray?
I really want to hear
from God.
Miraculously,
he got that
Republican nomination
with Paula claiming
that he was sanctioned
by God
and that his opponents,
quote,
operate in sorcery
and witchcraft,
going on to say,
any persons or entities
that are aligned
against the president
will be exposed
and dealt with
and overturned
by the superior blood
of Jesus.
Paula White
now holds
a government position
as head of the White House's
Faith and Opportunity Initiative,
and now she's also using COVID
to solicit donations
for her church,
admitting that they may not
heal the physically sick,
but they will heal
the spiritually sick.
Paula's friend,
Jim Baker,
came back on the airwaves
after his short stint in prison,
only five years,
and now he's doing
the doomsday prepper thing,
hawking overpriced,
freeze-dried food
and selling his
silver solution
that cures
not only COVID-19,
but also all sexually
transmitted diseases
for some reason.
But be careful,
because Jim Baker
has also made
the proclamation
that God will punish
those who make fun of him.
I guess I'll see you in hell.
Speaking of making fun
of evangelicals,
you'll remember
that we left
little Marjo
in the heart
of the hippie movement,
a total non-believer
who nonetheless
returned to the revival circuit
to perform
because it was all
he knew how to do
to make a living.
But eventually,
the guilt of preaching
hell for cash
won out.
But that wasn't it
for Marjo,
and he would go on
to return to the public eye
again in 1972
when he was in his
late 20s,
joining a visibly stoned
documentary crew
of obvious hippies
pretending to be making
a nice little
evangelical church documentary.
They followed him
as he preached
the circuit
with his same brand
of ecstatic fervor,
raking in the cash
with his fellow preachers
behind the scenes,
revealing a huckster
underbelly
of charismatic preaching
and seed donations
that he had grown
to despise.
Hallelujah!
Your father created
these things
for his people
if they'll use them right.
Bless God,
I'm gonna drive
that Cadillac down here
and get it dusty
and dirty
and use it for God!
Hallelujah!
Thank you, Jesus!
Marjo would respond
to the accusations
that popped up
from his religious critics.
Quote,
A lot of people
have charged
that I made the movie
for money.
That's ridiculous.
In five years,
I would have been on top
and probably a millionaire.
One thing a lot of people
forget about
is the tax advantage.
I was tax deductible.
The film,
called Marjo,
would win the 1972 Oscar
for Best Documentary Film,
but this expose
wouldn't be viewed
beyond the more liberal circles,
and it certainly
wouldn't be enough
to stop the coming power tide
of the religious right.
Cranky old elf
Pat Robertson
is still at it today
at freaking 90,
sitting at a net worth
of more than
a hundred million dollars,
with several failed
apocalypse predictions
under his belt,
including a recent one,
as well as several mansions
and a racehorse
named Mr. Pat
as he shall henceforth
and forever be known.
If you're like me,
you'll catch him sometimes
when you're trying
to catch reruns
of Pretty Little Liars,
because for some reason
they're on the same network now.
But if you look deeper
into Mr. Pat,
you'll find that he is the son
of one of 19 senators
that signed
the Southern Manifesto
in an attempt
to block the federal government
from imposing integration
after Brown v.
the Board of Education.
And as we've seen,
the seeds that made
the moral majority
and the seeds they planted
keep bearing
their dangerous fruits.
Here's Mr. Pat
from just a few months ago.
It's not just
the statement,
of course,
Black Lives Matter.
They're talking about
destroying the nuclear family.
They're talking about
destroying,
essentially,
Christianity
as being racist.
All the way through,
they want to upend
the capitalist structure
and destroy America.
Pop evangelicalism
can be a vessel
for those who want to,
as is American tradition,
flamboyantly con the public
out of their cash.
But also,
these old-timey hucksters,
segregationalists,
and even straight-up
exiled fascists
can sneak a lot
of their own agenda
through in the name
of religious freedom.
And they can find support
in certain opportunist
politicians
who know the power
of the evangelical vote.
Through inflaming
ingrained cultural prejudices
in their fans,
they can use
classic atrocity propaganda
of babies in danger,
of the perversion
of children,
whether through racial mixing
at first,
and then the gay agenda
that stretches into
the present day.
Behind the scenes,
the real rallying points
seem to have been
tax exemptions,
the desire to break
federal law
while raking in
federal benefits,
while at the same time
protecting their power
in the social hierarchy,
all based on dubious
Bible quotes
pulled from an ancient document,
a document that skewers
the rich
and blesses the poor.
What really sucks
is that this industry
is the core spirituality
for so many.
Not only do those preachers
promise a better life
fantastically,
but they also claim
that with your donation,
you can spread
the prosperity to others
through the same saving grace
that you yourself
are receiving.
It's a very simple
and very human hope
to exploit.
It's a gut-wrenching con.
The seeds keep being planted,
sure,
sprouting Cadillacs
and Rolls Royces
and seaside mansions
and private jets,
but they never bear
the promised fruits
that might alleviate
the financial stress
of those donating
to this story.
And certainly,
these miracles don't happen
for the millions
of impoverished kids
and adults,
disproportionately black
and queer people,
the very groups
they've actively
discriminated against.
But of course,
as the prosperity gospel says,
they just aren't honoring God
quite enough
to deserve
that air-conditioned doghouse.
The prosperity gospel
is a promise,
and a promise
is always easier
than an action.
Despite their many transgressions,
some televangelists
have influenced
their audiences
of millions
in progressive ways.
When Tammy Faye Baker
entered the pop Christian world,
she and Jim were coming
from the Pentecostal tradition
that just didn't have
the same fire
and brimstone backbone
as evangelicalism did.
And Tammy believed,
first and foremost,
that unconditional love
is the highest order of God.
Part of why Tammy Faye
was so loved in her heyday
was that she took
a totally different approach
than Jerry Falwell
and Pat Robertson,
believing she could do more
to help her audience
by entering more controversial
and realistic territory.
And so,
she turned the lens
on herself.
She talked frankly
about sex,
about her breast enhancement
surgery,
and about her addiction
to prescription drugs.
She also invited
black people
onto her show,
as well as gay men,
and even HIV-positive gay men,
to share their stories,
which was revolutionary
at the time.
And Tammy Faye,
in all her years,
would never condemn
homosexuality,
despite being steeped
in a culture that did.
Like Billy Graham
removing the racial barriers
of his church
and taking Martin Luther King
on a national tour,
the millions that would see
these symbols of civil rights
being preached
by a person they trust
with their souls,
well,
it probably made a difference.
One person can plant
many different kinds of seeds
in their lifetime.
And,
according to how you define it,
these seeds can lead
to very different kinds
of prosperity.
After the Bakers
lost everything,
Tammy Faye divorced Jim
and began to try
to rebuild her life.
In 2000,
she would be the subject
of a documentary
hosted by famous
drag queen Ru Paul
called
The Eyes of Tammy Faye.
It turned out
that her progressive stances
throughout the deadly homophobia
of the 70s, 80s, and 90s
had not gone unnoticed
and had not been forgotten.
Tammy Faye stated that,
when we lost everything,
it was the gay people
that came to my rescue,
and I'll always love them
for that.
Through her years on the air,
she had become
a kind of underground
drag queen icon,
a larger-than-life,
blown-out,
campy version
of American femininity
that drag tries to emulate.
She would go on
to co-host a show
with her dear gay friend
called
The Jim Jay
and Tammy Faye Show,
and she would be a fixture
at Pride Parades
for years to come,
where she became known
as
the ultimate drag queen.
Her son,
Jay Baker,
was just 12 years old
when his father
went to prison
and his family
was sorely rejected
from their community.
After years of struggling
with substance abuse
and emotional turmoil,
he would come back
to tweak the family business
and become
a self-described
punk preacher,
as well as a long-term
activist for
LGBTQ civil rights
and now
the Black Lives Matter movement.
Jay Baker
is currently running
the Revolution Church
in Minneapolis,
where there is no
light-soaked stage,
no semicircle
of American flags,
no water slide
that makes you a saint,
and no one turned away.
It's just a small congregation,
still broadcast worldwide,
that holds their services
in a bowling alley bar.
This was American Hysteria.
Next time on the show,
we're going to explore
more culty characters
to find out why
any of us
could fall prey
to charismatic leaders.
But next week,
we're really excited
to explore
the rich history
of Black televangelism
and its place
in culture and politics
with Dr. Lerone A. Martin,
author and professor
of religion and politics
at Washington University.
The nonprofit
we'd like to highlight today
is Jay Baker's
Revolution Church
that we mentioned
at the end of the episode.
They usually just like
to pass the hat
around the bowling alley,
but I thought
we could give them
a little bit
of our very own
American Hysteria,
punk rock,
Christ-like love.

Thanks, as always,
for listening.
And now to play us out,
here's one of the scariest
people I've ever seen,
televangelist Kenneth Copeland.
The media said what?
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
The media said,
Joe Biden's president.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

Ha ha ha ha ha.
Have a great week.
