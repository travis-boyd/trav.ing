On this season, we'll explore our most ingrained beliefs, delusions, and archetypes,
the ways that cognitive dissonance shapes our culture, and how our reality is created
by the stories we tell. I'm your host, Chelsea Weber-Smith, and this is American Hysteria.
You can put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables.
My administration is putting an end to the war on coal.
There's a lot of confusion amongst white people in this country, amongst white workers in this
country about who the enemy is.
Welcome to my world!
For part of my youth, I shot rifles up in the hills near Olympia, Washington, fished for
trout from a rickety silver boat, learned to shoot a bow and arrow, camped in the middle
of nowhere with my dad and howled along with the coyotes, caught snakes in the tall grass,
learned to play equally rickety country music, tearing the sleeves off my shirt, and riding
in the back of my dad's pickup truck at sometimes questionable speeds.
On the other side of my family, I listened to Johnny Cash with my beloved grandpa throwing
horseshoes across the lawn and dreaming of the clang of a ringer.
I wanted to be a cowboy.
I wanted to be like my grandpa.
I listened with rapt attention to the childhood stories of him riding his horse to school through
the glowing green of the North Dakota hills in a tiny town called Dunceith.
He grew up very poor in a little wooden house, the winter's a possible death sentence, his
dad once making moonshine inside the basement, him sneaking drinks of southern comfort and
falling asleep in the field, or sneaking out to a rowdy barn dance that was forbidden by
the priest.
As I covered in our Hipsters episode, I've always lived a dual life.
One of opportunity and education, fulfillment of desired Christmas gifts, safety with a
good mom and stepdad that provided me generously with all the things I needed.
But I did live in another kind of world on the weekends, and another kind of world riding
in my grandpa's light blue Datsun pickup or his red Ford F-150.
These were conflicting identities in many ways, and as I took off in my own pickup truck toward
my grandpa's North Dakota, I sat alone around a campfire many nights, thinking about him,
thinking about his kindness, his gentleness, and how I could emulate the man who was my
hero.
A hero who could have been called a redneck, could have been called white trash, could have
been called a hillbilly, but never seemed to exhibit the uglier kinds of stereotypes that
often come along with those names.
A man who would never, not in a million years, have voted for Donald Trump.
This is an episode that may be uncomfortable at times because of the narratives we have all
inherited and the simplistic history of race and class that has intentionally pitted us all
against each other for a very long time.
In fact, the racial categories we know today were never inherent.
They were constructed as a tactic way back in the 1600s by the elite plantation owners and
politicians of the American South to protect their own power from potential revolts.
But we'll also see how those racial lines have been crossed throughout history by workers
in solidarity.
Even with the spreading stories of feeble-minded and dangerous hillbillies who fascinated and terrified
suburbia, the banjo-playing mutant monsters isolated in the hills, those that would become
a large focus of 20th century eugenics.
Those considered racist white trash have been blamed again and again by the media and much
of middle-class America for the victory of Donald Trump, despite the fact that polling has shown
that middle-class suburbia and upper-class voters were just as responsible.
But when we employ our cognitive dissonance, when we have someone else to point the finger
at, someone who is the real racist, it makes it easier for us to ignore parts of ourselves,
the bigotry that has historically come from both sides of the political spectrum, both the
very poor, but even more so, the very rich.
Extreme economic privilege and privilege in general is often able to put on the right face through
education, say the right things, and determine who gets to be the good ones and who becomes
the bad, the ones we so rabidly love to blame.
No power on Earth can exercise the terror from scum of the Earth, the real poor white trash.
Horror movies say more about the prevailing cultural fears of their time than most other
popular culture media.
These films have only a short amount of time to scare the audience as much as possible,
and building an entire separate world of horror proves difficult in 120 minutes.
As a result, directors rely on already embedded fears, and in a feedback loop, they both illustrate
current anxieties and reinforce them as well.
I recently watched the 1972 horror movie Deliverance, a film nominated for several Academy Awards,
including Best Picture.
It's certainly the most famous pop-cultural portrait of the region called Appalachia that's
ever been made, and it would go on to inform the subgenre known as hillbilly horror up to
the present day.
In the film, four men from the city of Atlanta, seeking adventure, canoe down a raging river in
northwestern Georgia and are sexually assaulted and picked off one by one by a group of evil
hillbillies, hell-bent on punishing them for their uppity class roots.
In the most famous scene of the film, one of the men plays his guitar along with a boy
implied to be inbred, who impresses the men with his rendition of dueling banjos.
Billy Redden, the 15-year-old boy scouted from the local school to play the character known
only as the Banjo Boy, became an archetype of Appalachia.
Described in the script as inbred, Billy was not actually physically or mentally disabled,
but the cast and crew shaved his head and used makeup in order to make him appear so, and
that idea of him lasts into the present day.
One star of the film and notorious asshole John Voight allegedly said of Billy with absolutely
no evidence, quote,
He was a boy who had a genetic imbalance.
A product of his mother and his brother, I think.
Hillbilly horror is still popular and is rarely met with much criticism for its offensive portrayals
of Appalachians and poor white rural folks in general.
The Hills Have Eyes, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and more recently, the Wrong Turn series all
share a sense of the inbred, sociopathically violent, dangerous, grinning, stupid slayers
of the middle-class city dwellers and suburbanites in their dark, wooded margins of our civilization.
These American monsters are presented with a complete lack of the traits of the middle class,
with no emulation of the well-mannered elitism that separated them from the others of whiteness.
Does the word Appalachia, the word hillbilly, conjure up for you visions of seething racism and homophobia,
of slurs dripping brown with chewing tobacco from the lips of evil white trash rednecks
who live in shacks with gutted deer hanging outside their door?
The archetype of the American redneck is far more complicated than we wish to believe.
The very complicated roots of black enslavement have led to right-wing extremists and politicians
promoting the idea that European immigrants were enslaved in the same way that the first Africans were.
Obviously, this was never the case, but the development of the ideas of blackness and whiteness
as categories for exploitation were not inherent to the colonists.
More than 80% of Europeans who took passage to America were a group called indentured servants,
those who made the choice to come to America toward what they considered a better life,
and they did so by signing contracts to plantation owners outlining their servitude
as unpaid labor with the promise of some acreage at the end of the agreement.
The first Africans to come to America, however, did not have that same choice.
This may seem unbelievable, but before the institution of slavery was actually written into law a handful of decades later,
African people actually had some similar rights to white indentured servants,
even the ability to vote and own land.
That is, until an African man named John Punch broke his contract,
fleeing a wealthy plantation owner with his two European indentured servant cohorts.
The three of them were eventually captured in 1640,
and John was forced into a lifetime of slavery with no possibility of freedom,
while the other two Europeans simply received an extension of their old contracts.
This marked the first legal moment where an African would be sentenced to a lifetime of enslavement,
something that would never, ever touch their European counterparts.
Indentured servants were suffering, certainly,
and they would be treated with any brutality that the plantation owners decided was appropriate.
In this way, poor immigrants felt far more aligned with the Africans they worked beside in the fields
under the abusive eyes of the elite.
Bacon's Rebellion of 1676 is an extremely complicated event that took place in Virginia,
at first a colonial fight against local tribes.
But eventually it turned into a kind of class war,
with Africans and Europeans fighting side by side against the rich landowners and politicians.
This moment, along with other similar uprisings,
sparked an idea in the upper crust,
and they purposefully employed that age-old strategy known as divide and conquer,
pitting these two groups against each other to keep their own status safe,
to keep the revolution at bay.
As black legal scholar Vernellia Randall said in her essay called Constructing Whiteness,
quote,
the large landowners had become an elite group faced with an increasingly unruly populace
of mostly European small landholders and artisans,
free men without land, again mostly European,
and bond laborers, of whom one quarter were African descent.
Soon, through legislation,
the planter class differentiated black people as lesser,
as a group unworthy of freedom,
one that must be under total control of the wealthy in order to keep them in line,
and to protect the Christian Anglo-Saxons from their deviant influence.
This new narrative of white supremacy gave an illusion that poor whites were just like the elite,
that they could eventually reach their position,
creating a status for them that was one rung above blackness.
It was a way of saying,
things may be bad, but at least you're a part of this better group,
at least you're one of us, and not one of them.
This new, superior category meant to pacify white indentured servants
would cost black folks the last of their rights,
and they would bear the burden of this new narrative
in horrific ways for the rest of the nation's history.
The first of these laws, unsurprisingly, focused on white women as property,
making it illegal for visibly black men to marry a woman of European blood.
It became illegal, too, for black people to raise a hand to any white person,
whether plantation owner or indentured servant.
Soon, property and livestock owned by those who were now considered black
was seized and redistributed to poor whites.
Any areas that had allowed Africans to vote revoked that privilege,
and black families were legally allowed to be broken up,
children taken away from their parents, and sold.
Within a few decades, race became the defining feature in America,
and the divisions of class became foggier,
with all working toward the benefit of the wealthy
in a hierarchy that began the systematic snuffing out
of the vital allegiances of the white and black working class.
After two grueling centuries of brutal enslavement,
and shortly before the outbreak of the Civil War,
a pro-slavery senator from South Carolina named James Henry Hammond
delivered what would become a famous speech about the benefits of slavery
to a divided Senate, chastising the North for their willingness to free slaves
at the cost, he believed, of the poor whites of the nation.
His mudsill theory rested upon its own metaphor,
that is, the threshold that supports the foundations of a building.
He believed that there would always be a lower class
that did the work of the elites.
But the decision had to be made.
Would that be black people, or would it be poor whites?
A plantation owner with 300 slaves,
Hammond spoke of them as, quote,
happy, content, and unaspiring.
He believed that the true evil existed in the North,
where the Union was willing to exploit those that he called brothers in blood.
The enslaved, he said, were well taken care of,
but the labor system in the North meant that the poor
did not have the same privileges that the plantation owners generously bestowed.
It would eventually be discovered that Hammond was a serial rapist
of his allegedly happy slaves,
including an enslaved woman who would go on to have a child,
likely Hammond's own daughter,
who he also raped when she was 12 years old.
Those going to war for the Confederate Army
suffered a serious lack of food rations,
specifically because the plantation owners
would not give up their cash crop of cotton
in order to grow more corn and wheat.
And they were hoarding huge amounts of food for themselves
while also stealing horses and farm animals
from the women and children who were left behind,
those who were also suffering from severe food shortages.
Men deserted the army to save themselves
from this extreme hunger and the horrors of war
to care for their families.
And there are even those who joined up with the enslaved
to revolt and build insular, multiracial communities
with union ties.
Those that were forced into battle
were known to call it, quote,
a rich man's war, but a poor man's fight.
Of course, these aren't sweeping truths,
because by the time the Civil War happened,
anti-Black racism had touched the hearts
of almost all white men in the nation.
But we have to remember that every soldier
of the Confederate Army was an individual,
and every soldier was required to fight.
These categories of white privilege and Black inferiority
were not well established in the more remote region
we mentioned earlier, called Appalachia,
which stretches from the south up into the northeast
and includes all of West Virginia
and the mountainous parts of Alabama, Georgia,
Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi,
New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia.
After the Civil War,
as railways spread into the south
and industrialized Appalachia,
a wave of writers looking for stories to sell
journeyed into the impoverished area
that had previously gone unnoticed.
These educated North Easterners
were known as local color writers,
and along with opportunist Christian missionaries,
they began painting a dramatic picture
for the middle class of the abject poverty
and the characters that inhabited
this strange and mythical area.
They too constructed this idea
of a pure Anglo-Saxon stock,
a lost white race,
the innocence that kept them
from the evils of industrialization
that unnerved the affluent thinking class.
But at the same time,
a second narrative was developing too,
as fiction writer John Fox Jr.'s novel
described mountain people
as savage, bloodthirsty barbarians,
and they became extremely popular.
They were described as having
ghastly yellowish white skin
like yellow parchment,
people who were listless and slothful
and could not care for their own children
because they were so addicted to alcohol.
Also popular was the myth
of this total familial isolation,
making it easy for the public
to create assumptions
that were backed by these stories,
assumptions of the inbreeding
that had to take place
in order for them to continue their communities.
Side note,
a pretty comprehensive study
done in the 1980s
showed that Appalachians practiced inbreeding
at no greater rate
than the rest of the United States.
By 1900,
the word hillbilly
would officially be coined
in the New York Journal
and was defined as,
quote,
A free and untrammeled white citizen
of Alabama
who lives in the hills
has no means to speak of,
dresses as he can,
talks as he pleases,
drinks whiskey when he gets it,
and fires off his revolver
as the fancy takes him.
At the same time
that middle and upper class writers
were exploiting the lives
of so-called hillbillies
for fame and money,
big business was descending
on what interested them most,
the huge ribbons of coal
lying under their dirty bare feet.
The companies bargained
with Appalachians
for their valuable land
in deals like
12 rifles and 13 hogs
for the rights
that would make the owners
of these companies
into fast millionaires
and would eventually produce
billions of dollars worth of coal.
These former landowners
needing income
quickly became coal miners,
and the companies set up labor camps
and paid workers
in an invented currency
called scrip
that could only be used
in the coal towns
owned by the companies
with prices hiked up exorbitantly.
As you might expect,
the working conditions
in these mines were horrific,
devastating accidents
and injuries were common,
and the workers were underpaid
and had almost no recourse
for this treatment.
The benefits of this exploitation
went straight to the shareholders
far away
who never even had
a dusting of coal
touch their hands
and the middle class
who were able to purchase
this cheap new energy.
All the big companies
bought up the coal mineral
for practically nothing
from the poor people.
Now they ain't got nothing
to live on or nothing else.
That's where it hurts at.
Those color writers
had completely
and conveniently
ignored the free black men
and women
as well as the indigenous people
that populated
the mountain region,
often living and working
alongside the white Appalachians.
In the Battle of Blair Mountain,
the workers found common ground
in their poverty
and exploitation
and a common enemy
in the abuse of coal companies.
The only thing we can do
is take over
where we are
and run that.
And if we can once
begin to do that
and build a base
from where we are all poor,
then maybe we can have
something to say
about how the society is running.
Today, I am a man
that can stand up
for human beings
and human dignity
and human rights.
In 1921,
10,000 to 20,000 miners
marched into Logan County,
West Virginia
in military formation,
demanding the right
to unionize.
The 3,000 lawmen
and coal company heads
that were opposing them
were supported
by the National Guard
on presidential order
and approximately
one million rounds
were fired
upon the protesters,
in addition to bombs
dropped from planes above.
Up to 100 miners
were killed
and many more
were arrested
and it would ultimately
be deemed
the largest labor uprising
in United States history.
A white miner
who fought in the battle
was quoted as saying,
I call it a darn solid mass
of different colors
and tribes,
blended together,
woven together,
bound, interlocked,
tongued and grooved
together in one body.
Though the term redneck
originally applied
to sunburnt European migrants,
all the miners,
white and black,
wore red bandanas
around their necks
as a sign of union solidarity
and were labeled
rednecks as a result.
As the coal industry
continued to grow
and began to automate
much of the work
that the unions
had fought for,
Appalachians started
leaving the region
to find stable work
in the factories
and city centers.
In a migration
along a symbolic route
known as the Hillbilly Highway,
thousands entered
the city of Chicago
and they were not met
with a warm welcome.
In fact,
many businesses
refused to serve
those they called hillbillies
and would hang signs
outside that said,
quote,
no Southerners need apply.
The sudden influx
of these impoverished whites
shook the affluent Southerners
to their cores
who had previously clung
to that idea
that only people of color
could be that poor,
that degenerate
as they viewed them
and a greater need
to scientifically classify
and solidify
categories of race
emerged to reinforce,
of course,
white supremacy.
In the following years,
a new term rose
to scientific
and psychological prominence,
feeble-mindedness,
and it applied often
to those deemed
as white trash people.
Of course,
black people
and other people of color
needed no qualifier
to be deemed trash
and were considered
feeble-minded as a whole,
while whites
would be categorized
as such
based on an early version
of the IQ test.
These IQ tests,
however,
were bound to show
the results
that reinforced
the racist
and classist views
of the scientists
and the elites
that supported them,
as poor whites
and minorities
in the South
did not receive
the same access
to education,
an issue that predated
the Civil War
and still exists today.
These IQ tests
were touted
by University of Virginia
Dean Harvey Ernest Jordan,
who called his home state
the perfect laboratory
to compare those
named the first families
of Virginia
with what he considered
the worst stock,
the feeble-minded poor.
These studies
would lead directly
to the Racial Integrity Act
of 1924,
supported by the
Anglo-Saxon Club,
who had founded
two posts in Charlottesville,
one for the town
and one for the students
at the University of Virginia.
Marriages between
white and black people
had long been illegal,
but the categories
of those deemed
mixed race
were blurry,
as it was sometimes
difficult to determine
their race
based on looks alone.
Every resident of Virginia
was required to register
with the State Bureau
of Vital Statistics
to be classified by race.
All doctors
were legally forced
to report
the racial history
of the infants
they birthed.
This was done
in order to keep
racial degeneracy
from infiltrating
the middle and upper class,
especially because
so many mixed race people
were able to pass
as white.
Terms previously used
in animal breeding
became commonplace,
and when Harvard
got in on eugenics
as well,
like most universities,
Professor William McDougall
proposed that those
of his superior stock,
called the aristogenic,
who inherited eliteness
birth through proper breeding,
should be separated
into a community
called eugenia,
centered around,
what else,
but a university.
Leading eugenicist
Charles Davenport
popularized the idea
that incest
was widespread
in Appalachia
and was considered
one of the cardinal sins
against upper class
white stock.
These ideas
would lead
to mass sterilizations
of those labeled
feeble-minded
who were almost
always considered
sexual deviants,
a great deal
of them poor whites
along with racial minorities.
There was even
a process called
mountain sweeps
that involved
the police
driving into Appalachia
to forcibly remove,
institutionalize,
and sterilize
pretty much anyone
they wanted to.
These procedures,
though,
were performed
at a higher rate
on those considered
feeble-minded
in the southern states,
so much so
that they garnered
a crude nickname,
Mississippi appendectomies.
These laws
helped comfort
the elite
to seal their privilege
in both whiteness
and class,
their superiority
in manners
and education.
These people
got to believe
that they deserved
everything they had,
that it was
the natural order.
On the other side
of the coin,
the impoverished
deserved
their position, too.
We have declared
unconditional war
on poverty.
Our objective
is total victory.
In a time
of desegregation,
poor whites
became the new
in-vogue
political focus
with President
Lyndon B. Johnson's
War on Poverty,
and his tour
of Appalachia
became a media
obsession,
much like it did
when the color writers
first infiltrated
that region.
Perhaps
well-intentioned,
this political
posturing
did indeed
fix some
short-term
issues
that Appalachia
faced,
but it also
reinforced
the narrative
of a false
singular identity
of this region
as white
and impoverished,
ignoring the
significant population
of people of color.
Johnson had,
perhaps unknowingly,
created an image
of the deserving
poor,
the white poor,
the pitiful poor,
even as poverty rates
were rising faster
for black people
in the city.
But in those
urban areas,
disenfranchised
citizens of color
as well as
white people
found common ground
as they once did
at the Battle
of Blair Mountain.
That's saying
that no matter
what color you are,
there's only two classes.
And that's saying
there's a class
over here
and there's a class
over there.
This is the oppressed,
this is the oppressor,
this is the exploiter,
this is the exploiter.
And these people
in this class
have divided themselves
and said,
I'm black
and I hate white people.
I'm hillbid,
I hate black people.
They want to keep you
to believing
that I'm your enemy.
They want to keep you
thinking that he's your enemy.
One of the leading members
of the Chicago branch
of the deeply misunderstood
Black Panther Party,
young and prolific
black activist
Fred Hampton,
is someone we talked about
extensively
in our terrorism series.
He was murdered
by the police
for his organizing
at just 21 years old,
shot point blank
in the bed he shared
with his pregnant fiance.
Fred left behind
an unparalleled legacy
of black activism
through his work
with the Black Panthers.
But a lesser known
contribution of Fred's
was the formation
of a multi-race group
of activists
he called
the Rainbow Coalition,
an alliance of black people,
Latinos,
and working class whites.
Along with the Young Lords,
a Latino rights organization,
the Panthers would meet activists
who lived in the area
of Chicago
known as Hillbilly Harlem,
full of those
that had followed
the Hillbilly Highway
into the city,
some of whom
had formed
the Young Patriots organization
and were known
for their display
of the Confederate flag.
Needless to say,
the Black Panthers
were disturbed by this,
but as each group
attended one another's meetings,
Fred saw that they were
fighting for
essentially the same things,
albeit in different ways,
poverty, unemployment,
police violence,
substandard housing,
inadequate schools,
and a lack of social services.
They told the Black Panthers
that the Confederate flag
was a symbol
of Southern rebellion,
an idea that came out
of the revisionist history
of the Civil War
known as the Lost Cause
that we'll talk about
in our mini-episode next week.
Fred would reluctantly allow
the flying of this symbol
just so long
as the Young Patriots
vocally denounced racism
as a whole.
By the end of these discussions,
however,
the Young Patriots organization
not only rejected
their own embedded ideas
of white supremacy,
they also agreed
to never fly
the Confederate flag again.
As the Rainbow Coalition,
they protected one another
from abusive police,
created healthcare clinics,
and set up food resources
for poor inner-city children
of all races.
These alliances
were not mainstream,
but this example showed
that there could still be
allegiances
between Black people
and poor whites.
And as we know,
many of these organizations
were brutally broken up
by the police
who came to protect
that precarious privilege
of the middle
and upper class.
That protection
could only go so far.
But the fear
of these alliances,
the fear of this
poor white stock,
the anger against those
that had proved to them
that whiteness alone
could not shield them
from a life of poverty,
would continue to inform
horror movies,
pop culture,
and the images
of that rabid Trump country
we see in the present day.
Coal has remained
a potent symbol
of the white working class
since its beginnings
in Appalachia,
as well as a harbinger
of dangerous climate change
to much of the left.
Let's look at two statements
that created decisive moments
that won this white
working class vote
for Donald Trump.
The first was Hillary Clinton's.
We're going to put
a lot of coal miners
and coal companies
out of business.
Compare that to this statement
by Donald Trump.
We are going to put
our coal miners
back to work.
Hillary Clinton's coal comments
were taken out of context
to be sure,
used as soundbites
across Fox News
over and over.
She meant that there was
no real way
to save the coal industry
as cheaper and more
sustainable energy
was moving full steam ahead,
no pun intended.
And so,
the alternative
that she presented
was one of retraining
coal workers
into working in green energy.
Trump was never going
to be able
to save the industry,
and predictably,
his policies
have not slowed
the closing of coal plants.
In fact,
they're closing
at higher rates
than ever before.
Of course,
he knew that was going
to happen,
but he knew too
that the most important thing
to those living
in poverty
is to be able
to take care of themselves
and their families.
Donald Trump
made his fame
rallying against the elite,
posing as a friend
of the working man,
more redneck
than the arrogantly educated
that made up
the establishment.
Of course,
as the billionaire
he claims to be
or the millionaire
he more likely is,
he couldn't be
any more elite.
But believing
that the enemies
are instead
the democratic elite,
the educated,
snooty, uppity,
liberal establishment
is appealing
to so many
who feel
that they're looked
down upon.
This is,
of course,
regardless of the fact
that the powerful
on both sides
of the political spectrum,
including most obviously
Donald Trump,
have everything to gain
from worker disenfranchisement,
have everything to gain
from the perpetuation
of that mud-sill theory,
their own riches
still built
on the backs
of the working class,
including,
most ironically,
the many undocumented immigrants
who performed manual labor
at Trump's resorts.
And as we know,
Trump manipulated most
the relationship
between working class
white people
and the evil immigrants
coming to steal
their jobs.
We know that
white male voters
overwhelmingly voted
for Trump,
and even the majority
of white women,
while black and Latino voters
primarily went
with Clinton.
The media painted
the average Trump voter
as a stupid,
racist redneck,
and it's true
that rural voters
came out
in greater numbers
than they had before
to vote for Trump.
But a lesser discussed fact
is that the majority
of those with incomes
over $50,000 a year
voted for Trump as well.
Along with the rural populations,
suburbia voted for Trump
by a margin of 5%.
But contrary to what
we might assume,
those working class folks
with union ties
ended up going
with Hillary Clinton.
It doesn't matter
what you look like.
It doesn't matter
how much money you have.
It doesn't matter
where you live.
Anyone in this country
can have an underlying foundation,
no matter how subconsciously,
of racism.
Either those made to believe
that they're just
one rung above black folks,
or those that have gained
generations of wealth
through their oppression,
or even those
that overlook
all of his problematic elements
in order to benefit
from his businessman approach
to the economy.
But hold on one second.
Let's listen to
another decisive moment
in Clinton's campaign
that would seal her failure
in the Rust Belt states.
You can put
half of Trump's supporters
into what I call
the basket of deplorables.
Right?
These words would play well
into Trump's narrative
as a man of the forgotten
and abused white working class
and would help the future media
blame rednecks at large
for his victory.
Trump has done far more
than most others
to promote the vocal rise
of alt-right white nationalism,
but he is not alone
in his racism.
He's just more public about it.
Clinton's legacy on race
is anything but squeaky clean,
as we explored
in our episode
called Dangerous Teens.
Aided by First Lady
Hillary Clinton's
construction of the idea
of the super predator,
which referred covertly,
or to me,
overtly,
to young black men,
aided in Bill Clinton's
creation of the 1994
Crime Bill
and the three strikes provision
that disproportionately
affected people of color
and led to the highest
incarceration rate
that the United States
had ever seen.
So yeah,
this thing called racism
isn't limited
to any population.
It isn't limited
to anyone.
In fact,
it lives inside all of us.
It's a legacy.
Many sociologists,
in fact,
have noted
that rednecks
serve as a kind
of psychic dumping ground
for liberals
and centrist white voters,
a group to blame
as the others,
a group to blame
for these problems
that still exist
in spades.
The Ivy Leagues
of the Northeast
would like to imagine
themselves as a distinctive
brand of liberalism,
but they were nonetheless
often constructed by slaves
or at least funded
by profits from slavery,
and they even reaped
the money from faraway
plantations that they owned
on occasion.
There's something about
the idea that being educated
absolves you of racism,
that learning how to talk
the talk means somehow
that you also walk the walk.
Take the University of Virginia,
for example,
a college I attended
from 2011 to 2013,
erected by its beloved
darling president
of the early 1800s,
Thomas Jefferson,
who famously wrote
perhaps the most American
of elite falsities.
All men are created equal.
Born rich and then well-educated,
Jefferson is considered
one of the most brilliant
Americans to ever exist,
writing about abolition,
yes,
but only if the enslaved
could be deported
away from the nation,
lest they band together
against their former
slave owners.
It's true that he did help
end the Atlantic slave trade,
but this was something
that never affected
his own privilege,
and by the end of his life,
Jefferson had owned
600 slaves,
around 200 of them
the day he died,
and he didn't even
free them in his will.
He defended fervently
white superiority
through his support
of eugenics
that would take root
in his very own
educational institute.
Jefferson knew the drill,
and he wrote about the fact
that in order
to justify slavery,
a white slave holder
needed to believe
that the worst white man
was better than
the best black man,
And he did believe that
until the day he died.
Just a mile or so away
from his elite university,
the neo-Nazi
and alt-right mob
that made up
the Unite the Right rally
would use those same ideas
in their defense
of white supremacy.
As I've talked about
on this show,
just five years before,
I was arrested
in that very same park
for my participation
in the Occupy
Charlottesville protests.
The thing about
the Occupy Wall Street movement
is that it revived
a tradition
of multiracial solidarity
against the elite,
a unity of the 99%,
everyone except
the billionaires,
i.e. the richest 1%.
But slowly,
the deafening cracks
began to show themselves,
and people of color,
queer people,
and women of all races
felt the weight
of a second-class citizenship,
despite this sweeping,
too-easy declaration
of togetherness.
The divisions
that the rich
literally manufactured
over the course
of American history
were still working
in their favor.
As President Lyndon B. Johnson,
the architect
of the War on Poverty,
once said,
quote,
if you can convince
the lowest white man
he's better
than the best colored man,
he won't notice
you're picking his pocket.
Hell,
give him somebody
to look down on,
and he'll empty
his pockets for you.
My grandpa listened
to Johnny Cash,
to June Carter
and her family,
to the queen of the earth,
Dolly Parton,
to Kenny Rogers,
rest in peace,
to Alan Jackson
and Willie Nelson.
We think of country music
as a white genre,
sometimes painfully white,
and often ridiculous
in the modern pop world,
with Blake Shelton's
I Roll Lines
making fun
of a popular hip-hop dance.
Well, the boys around here,
they're keeping it country.
Ain't a damn one know
how to do the Dougie.
You don't do the Dougie?
No, not in Kentucky.
Lies about Appalachia,
which includes Kentucky,
have constructed it
as a white place.
But as we learned
with the Battle of Blair Mountain,
that's never been the case.
And just like blues,
just like jazz,
just like rock and roll,
Black folks are responsible
for so much of what we know
as a country, folk,
old-time sound.
The banjo,
made famously white
by minstrelsy
and then deliverance,
was a West African instrument
brought across
the Atlantic slave trade,
which then joined forces
with the fiddle,
an instrument of European origin.
Black folks and white folks
in Appalachia
joined forces
to create the country sound
that we know today.
That is,
until the capitalism
of the recording industry
divided the genres
into race music
that focused on blues,
gospel, and jug bands,
and hillbilly music,
made up of country and folk.
Those Black artists
who played country music
had to quickly adapt
to these new constructs
if they wanted to cut records
and make money.
White musicians
would go on
to keep the banjo
as their own
and find more success,
of course,
than their Black counterparts.
But both genres
implied a lower status,
and hillbilly music
was considered
just a rung above
race music
in the hierarchy
of entertainment.
Wishing to better
understand my grandpa,
this man who was,
for me,
the truest pillar
of kindness
and gentleness
that I knew,
a man so unlike
the stereotypes
of the racist,
dangerous,
stupid backwoods redneck,
I drove my own pickup truck
from Seattle
out to North Dakota
and found myself
sitting across
from his relative
at the only restaurant
in town.
Not knowing I was queer,
she said cruel things
about gay people,
another stereotype
bestowed almost singularly
on southern rednecks,
despite notoriously
liberal Californians
voting to eliminate
same-sex couples
right to marry
in 2008,
and despite the fact
that today,
West Virginia
has the highest population
of transgender teenagers.
And the fact
that in my personal experience,
the most times
I'd ever been called
a homophobic slur
was in the heart
of liberal Seattle.
This relative
also took me
up to her double-wide,
fed me generously,
sang my praises,
with love in her voice.
My 10-year-old cousin
walked her horse with me
down a long dirt road
under the same blue sky
that my grandpa
had ridden his own horse
to school,
the same route
I had imagined
a million times,
and I felt,
in many ways,
like I was home.
It was all
deeply complicated,
and even now,
it's not something
I can easily unravel.
Months later,
when that same relative
learned I was gay,
she softened
so easily,
and she never had
a bad word
to say after that.
I know that love
doesn't always work,
I'm not naive,
I've hitchhiked
my way through the South
and heard the most
vitriolic racism
I could have ever imagined,
and no sweet nothings
would have softened
those angry men.
There are many people
all over the country
who will likely
never change,
extremists
and white supremacists
like the ones
we saw in Charlottesville,
but also,
those all over
the spectrum
who refuse
to ever think
about the problems
that exist
inside them too.
Those aren't the people
we're talking about,
and I don't know
how to fix
that type of thinking,
but I don't think
it's naive
to imagine
that most of us
are not so fragmented
as to never be able
to come together again.
I know that the privilege
of my middle class life
means that I can never
fully understand
my grandpa's experience,
even with my gun-shooting,
trout-fishing,
horseshoe-throwing childhood,
just as I cannot
fully understand
this podcast episode
I've made,
the pain of poverty,
both black and white,
the pain that doesn't
belong to me.
But just because
I can't ever fully understand
doesn't mean
that I shouldn't try,
not just with research
and writing,
but by unlearning
the racism and classism
that America has soaked
each and every one of us in,
working-class redneck
and elite PhD student,
conservative and liberal alike.
By pointing the finger
inward first,
we begin moving toward
the teamwork it takes
to battle the policies
of the powerful
that harm the large majority
of Americans to this day.
It takes hard work
and it takes humility
to understand each other.
On that same trip
to North Dakota,
I was driven in the back
of yet another pickup truck,
this one bright yellow,
across the technicolor
glowing green of the grass
to the wooded area
where my grandpa's
small house once stood.
All that was left
was an outline,
a few bricks
that implied everything
about what it was like
to grow up there,
the beauty and the pain.
When I finally returned
to Seattle,
when the city
that never could quite feel
like home rose up around me,
I brought my grandpa back
a single brick
from the remains
of his beloved house,
from his old beloved life,
and he put it up
on his mantle
where he could look at it
every day.
My grandpa's favorite story,
his proudest achievement
that eclipsed everything else
he had ever accomplished,
was about the time
he won a singing contest
as a little kid
at a barn dance
with his sincere rendition
of the old-time tune
Red River Valley.
I wanted to understand
my grandpa
the best way that I could,
and so I sat with him,
across from his bright blue eyes,
and sang him
the best that I could,
his favorite country song.
Come and sit by my side
if you love me
Do not hasten
to bid me adieu
But remember
that red river valley
And the cowboy
who loved you so true
For our beloved grandpa,
Ray Hoganson,
this was American Hysteria.
Next time on the show,
we're covering
the complicated,
revisionist narrative
of the Civil War
known as the Lost Cause.
After that,
we're taking a little break
for a couple weeks,
and we'll come back
to talk about
the homeless.
The nonprofit
we'd like to highlight
this week
is the Highlander
Research and Education Center.
This organization
serves as a catalyst
for grassroots organizing
and movement building
in Appalachia
in the U.S. South.
You can find the link

Do you think so?
Mm-hmm.
Does that feel good?
Yeah.
Sounded good to me.
All right.
You think so?
Put it in there.
Okay.
All right.
All right.
