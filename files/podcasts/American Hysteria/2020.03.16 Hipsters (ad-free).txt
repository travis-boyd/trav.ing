On this season, we'll explore our most ingrained beliefs, delusions, and archetypes,
the ways that cognitive dissonance shapes our culture, and how our reality is created
by the stories we tell. I'm your host, Chelsea Weber-Smith, and this is American Hysteria.
Angel-headed hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection.
Like, appropriated from lumberjacks, like woodsy livin', woodsy folksy livin'.
You know what I hate? Stupid posers. You're not cool, you're really, really starting to aggravate me.
I stay cool, and dig all job. That's the reason I stay alive.
When I was in my late teens and early 20s, I lived two very opposite lives.
I entered college as an English major and began a prolific hitchhiking career.
For nine months out of the year, I was writing academic essays about obscure poets and writing poems of my own.
But during those summer months, I made it to almost every state, took hundreds of rides, hopped a train,
camped every night, and trudged back into school each September with my personal brand of a slightly unmanageable manic shimmering.
I'd write for hours and hours about all the things I had learned, all the people I had met, my love a gold cut across my chest,
a welcome wound from this real world I had finally touched.
This was my rebellion after a whirlwind dual suburban high school life, good grades in the favor of teachers,
and the secret trouble I loved to get into.
Like beat writer Jack Kerouac, whose book On the Road was published during the 1950s as this new generation was coined the hipsters.
I thought the road had lessons to teach me.
I thought the real world was somewhere out there.
And I thought that I had the right to enter it.
In truth, I did learn the most important lessons of my life, and I brought them back to the circle of writers at my college,
safe and sound, with plenty of space and time to live out my art, to tell stories that perhaps have never been mine to tell.
Okay, we should start by defining what a hipster means in this episode.
Though it isn't a hard and fast rule, I guess anyone can be a hipster.
Today we're talking specifically about the white, middle, and upper class hipsters.
This character, in essence, is a seeker of cool, one whose personal brand of individuality is actually anything but.
We'll be talking about trendsetters, considered geniuses of their time, who were also posers,
taking almost all their cues from the black, queer, and blue-collar communities,
often flocking to the parties and meeting places of the marginalized.
First, we'll look at the mid-19th century transcendentalist writer Henry David Thoreau's famous cabin,
where he went to live a simple life of self-actualization,
which just happened to be smack dab in the middle of the land that freed slaves had made their new home.
At the same time, the affluent who stayed in the city were attending what were literally called slumming parties,
being entertained in the dangerous parts of the city with fake police raids and staged shootings.
And then, as we talked about in our episode called Teenage Sex,
the Roaring Twenties saw white youth pour into jazz clubs to see black musicians
trying to emulate the glowing cool that they had yet to experience.
They poured, too, into drag ball parties,
where queers of all stripes put on lavish cabarets and drag performances
that blew away any parties that these early hipsters had ever been to before.
By the late 1940s, after the Depression and World War II had devastated America
and the suburbs were greening outside these troubled cities,
a group known as the Beat Poets sought the real and authentic,
following around black jazz musicians to copy their every move and their every word.
Then we'll look at the more modern echoes of these artists
and how hipster fashion has transitioned via artists like Nirvana Frontman's grungy working-class outfits
and how all these influences—black, queer, and blue-collar—
have affected the idea of cool up to the present day.
We'll look also at the cognitive dissonance of the archetypal suburban hipster
and how our posturing, our posing, can act as a shield against our own privilege
and our own responsibility and can absolve us of who we really are.
We'll look at how this idea of cool was developed,
something cultivated by oppressed communities.
I'll look, too, at the positive side of what it means to reject the often ugly traditions
of the generation that came before,
and how my own Karawakian American adventures have given me a sense of our fragmented national culture,
of the problematic, and of the heartbreaking beauty,
without which I certainly would never have been able to make this show.
Today we answer what I assume are your most burning questions.
Am I, Chelsea Weber Smith, a hipster?
Even more so, am I a poser?
The answer to both of these questions is a resounding yes.
This isn't super related to the rest of the episode,
but you'll probably be delighted to learn, as I was,
that we can point to Yankee Doodle Dandy as the first iteration of the American hipster,
or, more accurately, we could refer to him as the very first American poser.
You'll, of course, remember the rhyme.
Yankee Doodle Dandy
A Yankee was a scathing nickname given by the cool British elite
to the Americans that they saw as stupid and classless.
A doodle at the time, basically meaning dumb idiot,
and riding on a pony instead of a horse was a homophobic slight.
The end of the rhyme is not weirdly referring to elbow pasta as I thought up until recently,
but instead to a fashion trend of the time,
as well as a derogatory nickname for those who followed it,
mostly college-educated young people who backpacked across Europe, like I did,
and brought their new cultured way of life back to the English masses,
including the Italian food called macaroni that they often bragged about trying.
These macaroni hipsters were pretty outrageous.
They wore enormous, high-white powdered wigs with teeny-tiny little hats on top,
and they were often gaunt men who wore the 18th-century version of skinny jeans,
carried expensive canes, and wore the pointiest shoes that England had ever seen.
To the British, these privileged Americans,
shuttling European culture in their pathetic attempt to reach the ranks of the trendsetters
was embarrassing.
In short, sticking a feather in his cap did not make him cool.
Like many other generations of the hip, the macaroni's fashion was effeminate,
with the mainstream calling them that doubtful gender.
But when the true macaronis of England used the insult,
it was a swipe at Americans in general,
basically in early 2000s style, calling them all gay.
But this copying of the rich would start to pivot
as Americans experienced more and more abundance during the Industrial Revolution,
as capitalism loomed to some as a nightmare that would mar the soul of the individual,
a new value emerging in America,
to be different, to find a way to fight against the overculture as a personal revolution.
But where to look for authenticity,
free from the pressures of middle and upper class values and conformity?
The marginalized, of course,
who had been living in their own authentic margins since the very beginning.
Minimalism, and an alleged rejection of mass corporate culture,
it was all the rage for young poets and artists to buy up little wooden cabins
out in the woods and rough it.
Much of this movement was inspired by a long-bearded,
brimmed hat-wearing hipster named Walt Whitman,
a super gay poet known to lounge in streams naked,
writing lines like,
I lean and loaf at my ease,
observing a spear of summer grass.
At first, he self-published his own book of poems called Leaves of Grass,
printing and distributing them himself as if they were the poetry zines of today,
basically leaving them in coffee shops like I used to do.
Not long after, it became hip to get back to nature,
and a poor but authentic lifestyle would be pursued by scores of privileged seekers.
I went into the woods because I wished to live deliberately,
to front only the essential facts of life,
and see if I could not learn what it had to teach,
and not, when I came to die,
discover that I had not lived.
Henry David Thoreau,
for those of you who might not fully remember your high school English classes on transcendentalist writers,
was a man who, by many accounts,
abandoned his affluent parents' pencil factory
to go and live in a one-room cabin near Walden Pond in Concord, Massachusetts.
He did this to find himself among the spirituality of nature,
away from what was, essentially, a suburban life.
Thoreau is most famous for his memoir about this time,
called Walden or A Life in the Woods,
a document cited by hipsters through the ages,
right up to the present day.
What makes these transcendentalists early hipsters
is that their focus was on the self,
a new philosophy and psychology
that came from the Romantic era directly preceding it.
The focus, for the very first time on a large scale,
was knowing the self,
and thus separating the self
from the complicated community of them,
of the mainstream,
rejecting society in favor of
one long, poetic selfie.
The story of Walden has become one
of a man of unparalleled depth,
shirking off the chains of the modern world
to be as humble and as simple as the poor.
But the thing about the Walden Woods
was that long before Henry David
took off his boots and waded in,
there were others living there,
ones who only received a brief mention
in his wildly successful book.
As much as Thoreau wanted to lean and loaf in nature,
he also wanted to live among the oppressed,
who he thought could teach him what he needed to know
about how to live without the complication of privilege.
He knew that Walden was,
essentially,
the black part of town,
the area with the worst farmland
in which former slaves were pushed to live.
One of his main influences
was a former slave named Zilpa White,
who had spent the 40 years prior
on a tiny sliver of land at Walden,
living alone with no money
in a cabin similar to Thoreau's,
though not as nice,
one she shared with her dogs, cats, and hens.
Thought of as a witch by the white people in town,
Zilpa's solidarity and frugal survival
was an inspiration to this 28-year-old poet,
as was the story of another former slave
named Brister Freeman,
who had made his own way
with just an acre of terrible soil
and a desire to live a life of freedom
and to have a family of his own.
There are two competing narratives
around the personality of Henry David Thoreau,
and it's likely that the truth,
as usual,
falls somewhere in the middle.
Stories abound and were certainly told
at the time by his snickering critics
that Henry David would return home to his town
that was actually not that far away
whenever he felt like it,
enjoying big meals cooked by his adoring mother,
who would also, of course,
do his laundry for him.
His enduring fans tell a different story
of a family fall from grace
and a life lived as a poor student
on and off at Harvard.
There has long been a standoff
to make Henry David Thoreau
into a man to be admired
or a privileged poser,
because perhaps, deep down,
we wonder the same things about ourselves.
But maybe he was both.
Other mid-19th century hipsters
stayed far away from nature,
instead living what was known
as a bohemian lifestyle
in all the major cities,
especially New York.
Bohemians were hipsters,
plain and simple,
middle-class young adults
living cheaply in cities,
wearing used clothing,
living unconventional drug and sex-happy lives,
most of them aspiring artists.
Their businesses and local hangouts
were nothing if not hipster paradises,
emulations of bygone eras,
Disney-fied into elite
yet bohemian party palaces.
You could walk an actual plank
at Don Dickerman's Pirate Den,
a cabaret with a real cannon,
parrots and monkeys,
all with the elaborate decor
of a pirate ship.
Meyer Horwitz's Village Barn
provided a combination of booze,
drugs, pastoral fantasy haystacks,
ironic square dancing,
and even real-ass barnyard animals.
In Chicago,
Vincent Noga's Gold Coast House of Correction
was a prison-themed party bar,
and a place called John's Coal Scuttle
provided patrons with the decorative experience
of being a coal miner.
A phenomenon known as slumming parties
became a huge, hip pastime
for privileged young people,
events that would take them
to the dangerous parts of town,
sometimes posing as charity workers,
and even pushing into homes
and spaces of immigrants
and black people
just to see how they lived,
to indulge in the behaviors
that had been forbidden to them.
The son of a U.S. senator
was actually escorted
to a slumming party
by a paid police officer.
Those who lived in these
so-called slums
began to see the value
in duping these posers
and created actual guided tours,
complete with staged shootings,
kidnappings,
and the exhibition
of marginalized human beings
like sex workers,
blind paupers,
and opium addicts.
This gawking exploitation,
this affluent white voyeurism,
nonetheless,
was one of the first examples
of the coolness
of racial and class mixing
that would continue to mark
the archetypal hipster's
movement through the world
and time itself.
We're all alone,
no chaperone
can get our number.
The world's in slumber,
let's misbehave.
There's something wild
about you, child,
that's so contagious.
Let's be outrageous,
let's misbehave.
Again, as we talked about
in Teenage Sex,
the jazz era
was the first meaningful
large-scale movement
that put young white people
in close proximity
to black people,
and it drove
mainstream white America
violently crazy.
As the KKK
returned to prominence
once more in the 1920s,
something we talk
more extensively about
in our terrorism episodes,
much of the older
mainstream culture
was horrifyingly complacent
and even sometimes
considered them
a kind of folk hero.
But the young felt
differently about race.
They saw value
in blackness,
for better or for worse,
and they saw the fun
and novelty
of this jazzy life
in a time when,
finally,
black celebrities
started to rise
to prominence,
exuding one of the most
valuable currencies
in existence,
coolness.
In the 1920s,
one borough of New York
was experiencing
experiencing a milestone
in the black cultural story,
one known as
the Harlem Renaissance,
which saw,
for the first time,
artistic success
for the black community
on a national scale.
Along with famous
jazz musicians,
poets and writers
like Langston Hughes,
Zora Neale Hurston,
and James Baldwin
incorporated the spirit
of jazz into their writing,
all while keeping
a close eye
on the influx
of white folks
that were starting
to change the landscape
of the black spaces
they had been cultivating
on the margins.
The popularity
of this culture
of blackness
became so ubiquitous
that Langston Hughes
actually penned
an essay called
When the Negro
Was in Vogue.
My father hoped
I'd be a boy
What a disappointment.
A girl my mother cried
And you can't see
when they got me
They both were satisfied
As far as I'm concerned
this thing is breaking up
my life
I don't know
whether I should take
a husband
or a wife
Only slightly less cool
than hanging out
with the black jazz cats
was hanging out
at the gay drag balls
that served as a spectacle
for experienced
hungry hipsters.
Of course
for the most part
America did not
approve of queer people
but they sure did approve
of their flamboyant
super fun parties.
Quick side note
I realize now
that not all
of our listeners
are familiar
with the term queer
and may wonder
if it's offensive.
It's actually
an updated expression
one I personally prefer
used as an umbrella term
to cover the spectrum
of the LGBTQ community.
Anyway
cities
especially New York
were havens
for young queers
just as they remain today
a place you could
actually find
other people
who share
a similar identity
a chance to find love
and be your weird
gender defying
fabulous secret self.
This attitude
proved attractive
and similarly
to the permissiveness
that was found
in conceptions
of black culture
you know
drugs and sex
this queer culture
served as a chance
for squares
to explore the feelings
that they may never
have explored otherwise
and of course
have a great time
gawking at the spectacle
of men dressed as women
women dressed as men
and feeling
just a little more
accepting
and a little more
smug
than those
who would refuse
to attend
something so
morally questionable
in what is now
known as the
pansy craze
lasting from the 1920s
into the 1930s
as many as
7,000 young
straight people
or people
pretending to be
straight
including well-known
celebrities
were crowding
into these parties
every night
watching people
wearing elaborate
costumes
competing for prizes
the relations
between white
queer people
and queer black
people
was not always
a happy match
the drag ball scene
had its roots
all the way back
to Harlem
in the late 1860s
when the black
fraternal organization
called the
Hamilton Lodge
created the first
parties of this kind
when the black
drag scene
became home
to the white
queers of the
upper and middle
class
who were seeking
acceptance
they were able
to afford
bigger and better
costumes
as well as
better seats
pushing out those
who had originally
created the culture
and then as the
cycle completed
the straight white
hipster voyeurs
came on the scenes
and bought up
all the seats
themselves
I ain't got no home
I'm just a roaming
round
just a wandering
worker
I go from town
to town
and the police
make it hard
wherever I may go
and I ain't got
no home
in this world
anymore
soon
the Great Depression
would snuff out
these parties
and early indie rocker
Woody Guthrie
would emerge
from a middle class
yet tragic life
to hitchhike
and train hop
the country
in order to find
work
but also to be
close to
and to tell
the stories
of
the poor
working class
he told
of this nation
that he found
through the
blue collar folk
songs that became
wildly popular
and remain
some of our
most patriotic
anthems
of the day
he was one
of the original
rambling men
a lineage
that would inform
my own rambling
decades later
in addition
to this
immersion
in the lives
of unionizers
and workers
he too
found black people
to be cool
enough to copy
he talked about
this as such
finding a
quote
negro minstrel
jazzy band
blowing
and tooting
and pounding
drums
up and down
our street
he claimed
that he studied
a black man
who was shining
shoes on the street
while singing
the blues
what Guthrie
called
the loneliest
music I ever
run on
in my life
he said
that these
black men
inspired him
to quote
sing out
the first song
I ever made up
by my own self
this train hopping
hitchhiking life
was necessary
for migrants
desperate for
any kind of work
but with the
help of Woody
who rose to a
fame he was
not expecting
this depression
era roaming
would become
a countercultural
rite of passage
for the hipsters
that would come
after him
and with the desire
for this on the road
adventure
with jazz in their bones
and a dream
of individualism
popularized by
Henry David Thoreau
the beat poets
the beatniks
came yelling
their poems
from under
every dingy
fire escape
what's a
hip cat
a hip cat
is a guy
who knows
all the answers
and I'll tell you
why
he's a high balloon
student
of the
Callaway vocab
get
he
he
he
by 1939
black jazz musician
Cab Callaway
published his book
of jazz slang
called
Cab Callaway's
Hepster Dictionary
Language of Jive
a hepster
he wrote
was a guy
who knows
all the answers
and understands
jive
at first
this term
was a badge
of cool
for white artists
and they soon
appropriated the term
as they did
with much of
what was called
jive talk
soon
these hepsters
would become
hipsters
the first use
of this word
and another group
of writers
combining the
philosophies
of the transcendentalists
like Henry David Thoreau
and the wild freedoms
of the 1920s
and added in
an excess
of eastern
spiritual thought
new to America
and a whole lot
of recreational drugs
this group
of poets
and writers
known as
the Beats
were described
by their patron saint
Jack Kerouac
as quote
rising and roaming
America
bumming and hitchhiking
everywhere
as characters
of a special
spirituality
poet Allen Ginsberg
would describe
their wild
counterculture
like this
I saw the best
minds of my generation
destroyed by madness
starving
hysterical
naked
dragging themselves
through the negro
streets at dawn
looking for an angry
fix
angel headed hipsters
burning for the
ancient heavenly
connection to the
starry dynamo
and the machinery
of night
floating across
the tops of cities
contemplating jazz
Kerouac was certainly
a student
a student of cool
by which I mean
a student of blackness
literally following
around jazz legends
like Zoot Sims
studying his mannerisms
his tastes
and the way he spoke
this homage
to black culture
was often expressed
by the Beats
with Kerouac's
hugely successful novel
On the Road
containing the following
passage
At lilac evening
I walked with
every muscle
aching
among the lights
of 27th and Welton
in the Denver
colored section
wishing I was a negro
feeling that the best
the white world
had offered
was not enough
life
joy
kicks
darkness
music
not enough nights
wishing I could
exchange worlds
with the happy
true-hearted
ecstatic
negroes
of America
Ripped to the eyeballs
on speed
for days and days
he typed on his
typewriter
on one long
ream of paper
sleeping very little
recounting these
tales of his
slumming adventures
as he thumbed it
and roughed it
across
the real
America
These books
and poems
were starting to
spread into the
mainstream
and the middle
class youth
wanted a piece
of this adventure
in individuality
The proud hipster
badge was dead
as soon as the
media and
corporations
caught on
selling the
beat poet look
to young people
all over the country
you know
berets and
turtlenecks
with this new
copycat
counterculture
eventually becoming
known as the
mildly pejorative
beatniks
These are the
beatniks
the defiant
young
coming from
every walk
of life
wrought with
suppressed emotions
and mocking
the everyday
course of
modern society
intent on
striking back
as they wage
a battle
for their
right to be
heard
Continuing the
long march
toward hipness
those apparent
non-posers
turned into
the hippies
often hitchhiking
often middle
class radicals
who came with
middle class
privilege
and a sense
that the right
thing to do
as always
was rebel
to drop out
of society
completely
Tattered and
thrifted clothes
hung loosely
on their bodies
as they sought
the tradition
of self-actualization
of realness
and truth
as we know
they also pressed
hard for civil rights
for black folks
and an end
to the Vietnam War
the environment
was a huge focus
and the hippies
found value
and later
an obsession
in the simple life
not unlike
Henry David Thoreau
and many went to
communes
to try to emulate
this lifestyle
and add in a little
pastoral fantasy
from the rural world
others stuck around
the cities
leaning and loafing
across hate
Ashbury
doing drugs
until they crashed
and burned
like the beats
before them
capped off
by the drug-fueled
Manson family
murders
the hippie culture
felt its death knell
and the malls
began carrying
their flowing
flower power style
without the radical
culture behind it
posers abounded
throughout the 1970s
and what made it
cool
was gone
for everything
that Seattle
has come to symbolize
about the great
Northwest
add one more
it is for better
or worse
the birthplace
of grunge
the grunge look
is an urban
lumberjack
anything goes
ensemble
of duck boots
tattered shirts
and long underwear
by the time
I was around
in the 1990s
white hipsters
were no longer
appropriating
black and gay
culture quite so much
but they were
obsessed with
the blue-collar lives
once celebrated
by Woody Guthrie
enter the patron saint
of the 1990s
Kurt Cobain
the bleach blonde
moody
high school dropout
who rose to
mainstream success
very quickly
and rose to
a status
of this
inauthenticity
he so loathed
grunge
the style
I consider
most influential
on how us
hipsters
dress today
was marked
by oversized
flannels
dirty jeans
with holes
at the knee
work boots
and messy hair
slacker meets
homeless person
meets industrial worker
our quintessential
look in
Kurt's Seattle
stomping grounds
and the Pacific
Northwest
at large
the youth
were idolizing
the fashions
of working class
America
the authenticity
of the poor
looking like
unemployed loggers
hipsters want
to be more real
than where we come from
and to the white
middle class
as we talked about
in our episode
called suburbia
the real was where
the danger was
the real was where
the struggle lived
and hipsters
were going to find it
by God
and even if we didn't
we could look
like we had
like Thoreau
wanted to live
in a simple
and older time
modern hipsters
today
seem to want
to emulate
a bygone era
an analog response
to a digital world
oh my god
you should see
my VHS collection
and imagine
an image of me
typing out poems
on a typewriter
in 2008
in addition
to copying
the marginalized
we want to go
back to a time
before
but that before
for many Americans
is a time
they would never
want to return to
in the modern era
soaked in the internet
hipsters are
anything and everything
everyone is special
and so
no one is
everything is borrowed
recycled
it seems that
there's nowhere new
to go
and hipster clothing
has certainly
become mainstream
so much so
that it's almost
hard not to dress
like a hipster
an example
comes to mind
from 2012
when all of these
hipster forces
of race, sexuality
and class
merged perfectly
in a Macklemorean
mainstream
amalgamation
kicked off
by his massive hit
thrift shop
white hip hop artist
the Seattle based
Macklemore
espoused the fun
of buying
second hand clothing
with the rapper
donning a flamboyant
fur coat
as he bounced
through the bins
of our local goodwill
the beat poets
inspired by the style
of queers and black folks
were the first
to popularize
second hand clothing
especially the purchasing
of elaborate fur coats
which was a kind
of direct response
and irony
to the capitalism
that marked
the affluent
and repressive
suburban post-war period
the cycle was complete
when a company
called Lord and Taylor
began selling fur coats
to rich kids
who wanted to look
like beatniks
but also wanted
to avoid the poor
who haunted the aisles
of their artsy potential
it brings to mind
also that famous
picture of Kurt Cobain
wearing a fur coat
and super cool sunglasses
one of Macklemore's
first big hits
was an anthem
called Same Love
a celebration
of the gay struggle
which was perhaps
a noble gesture
but a categorically hipster one
in the ways
we've defined it today
one in which
queer culture
and obviously
black culture
led to an unparalleled success
in the white mainstream
with his music
sometimes called
hip-hop
for suburban moms
for decades
hipsters have benefited
from copying
marginalized communities
and 1920s
black writer
Langston Hughes
wrote of this
successful co-option
in his book called
When the Negro
Was in Vogue
quote
it was a period
when white writers
wrote about negroes
more successfully
commercially speaking
than negroes did
about themselves
not only that
but the drug use
that marked
each counterculture
and led to many deaths
among these leaders
of cool
has to this day
been a predominantly
middle and upper class
white issue
as we use
illegal drugs
at higher rates
than our black
lower income
counterparts
and yet
as we talked about
in our episode
called drugs
it's the black community
who have always been
disproportionately
arrested
and imprisoned
so okay
let's see if we can
figure out
this thing called
the hipster
a young person
who desires
nothing more
than to assert
an aggressive
individuality
while also
clinging to a
counterculture
part of a collective
but still standing
out
human animals
want both
of these things
for hundreds
of thousands
of years
hunter gatherers
needed to be part
of a group
in order to receive
the benefits
safety
other humans
to mate with
a share of the food
a sense of love
and care
and the bursts
of oxytocin
that it provides
to the brain
but at the same
time
we want to
stand out
to be singled out
to possess qualities
that make us
attractive to
potential mates
and the serotonin
they provide
hence a
counterculture
community
or at least
an association
that allows
the members
to still assert
a persona
counter to the
mainstream
we are pissed
off when our
specialness is
challenged
by the posers
who want our
social benefits
those who make
us not so special
anymore
by dressing
the same way
that we do
it seems that
the rejection
of all things
popular
is simply
the desire
not to be lost
in the crowd
the desire
not to be average
the fear
of risking
the power
that comes
with being
an individual
1950s black
novelist
Ralph Ellison
claimed that
being cool
was resistance
to provocation
coolness
under pressure
indispensable
values
in the struggle
for freedom
historically
black folks
and queer
people
have only
really been
accepted
as entertainers
just as they
were during
the pansy craze
in the jazz
era
presenting with
a kind of
confidence
both groups
could find
just enough
power to get
by
black artists
like Ralph
Ellison
believed this
cool was a
necessary strength
a necessary
calm
a secret
language
that could
sometimes
protect them
from abuse
by plantation
owners
from the police
from dangerous
racists at large
by being
non-reactive
with a restraint
most of us
could never
imagine
queer folks
and historically
especially
black queer
people
develop their
own version
of cool
pride
the strength
to also
remain calm
and happy
while being
constantly
the focus
of laughter
ridicule
and hate
and to this
day
we've made
it work
for us
it's also
important to
note that
the white
queer culture
that developed
also followed
the cues
of the black
queer community
sometimes pushing
them to the
margins
of the spaces
they developed
and once
the posers
poured in
ones with
no marginalized
identity
the hipster
cycle
was complete
and the cycle
remains so
to this day
like we're
talking about
on this season
there is a
convenient
cognitive dissonance
that privileged
young people
have used
since the beginning
and so many
of us still do
in a way
we pose
as minorities
we try to
take on
their struggle
and make it
our own
and we see
ourselves
as the good
ones
willing to
adventure
into the
controversial
spaces
that the
mainstream
culture
tells us
we are
not
supposed
to
I think
it might
be
a way
to absolve
ourselves
a way
to assert
that we
are better
more progressive
than those
who do not
make the
same
homage
this
homage
that often
eclipses
the very
cultures
from which
it takes
its cues
we can
look back
at the
hipness
of middle
and upper
class
slumming
those brave
young adults
who once
posed
as charity
workers
to literally
push inside
minority
spaces
the rich
kids
that hired
cops
to escort
them
through the
inner city
these
contradictions
this
long-term
interplay
between
minority
groups
and the
enlightened
hipsters
they inspire
is deeply
complicated
black artists
and the
white artists
they inspired
were often
friends
and often
felt a
kinship
and a
gratefulness
for each
other
but homage
is a
delicate
idea
because
when homage
becomes success
becomes fame
becomes money
it's no longer
just homage
it's theft
but without
these middle
class kids
rejecting the
overt racism
and homophobia
that was the
status quo
it's hard to
imagine that
we would have
continued our
slow march
toward any
kind of
justice
without them
because the
other option
at that time
was to stay
in their place
in the affluent
white status
quo
to simply
carry on
the prejudiced
traditions
of the previous
generation
of their
current generation
to stay
quietly in
line
instead of
rebelling
however
problematically
toward a
more just
society
the mainstream
has only
seemed to
care
to listen
after these
declarations
of cool
only after
that coolness
made the
frightening
unfamiliar
into the
familiar
after
of course
it trickled
down
all the way
to the
suburban
moms
it might seem
like a stretch
but I think
coolness
may be the
single most
important
cultural
mechanism
of change
but that
doesn't
make those
who chase
after it
into the
simple heroes
of our
story
nor does
it make
them the
simple
villains
no one
has ever
wanted to
cop to
the fact
that they
themselves
are a
hipster
and often
the hipsteriest
hipster
turns his or
her nose up
and points
the finger
at someone
they deem
the real
hipster
we all know
the type
as it's
often
talked about
the modern
hipster
mode
sort of
opposite
to the
transcendentalists
and the
beats
has been
all about
irony
about
not caring
about a
hollow
individuality
cultivated
by the
pictures
we take
of ourselves
and display
to all
our social
media
followers
the way
we look
the way
we present
ourselves
means so
much more
to us
than we
want to
admit
because
if we
look the
part
if we
tweet
the right
buzzwords
if we
show our
modern
homage
to the
marginalized
do we
let selfies
stand in
for political
actions
is the
sense of
satisfaction
we get
in those
moments
actually
driving us
further away
from our
intended
goals
instead of
pointing out
the hipsters
and the
posers
maybe we
ought to
look at
the poser
staring back
from our
iPhone screen
there are
simultaneous
truths
about who
I have
been
throughout
my life
I grew
up a
middle-class
white suburban
teen
and then
a privileged
college student
not unlike
the beat
poets
but at the
same time
in my
other life
what I
found on
the road
was a
country of
hurt
of every
kind of
American
you can
think of
who told
me their
stories
their secrets
their dreams
and most
often
their pain
many many
of these
rides
came from
blue-collar
white American
men
wearing the
outfits of
Kurt Cobain
the outfits
I was wearing
a life that
couldn't be
farther from
my own
understanding
at the end
of the day
even though
I did make
a brave choice
as a queer
female presenting
individual
my privilege
still shielded
me
and I
was safe
if I
needed it
I could
be saved
and taken
out of
this life
and put
easily
back
into
my other
one
as an
admitted
hipster
myself
I want
to think
of who
I am
beyond
what I
can take
the ways
I am
real
and the
ways
I'm a
poser
without
even
noticing
my life
on the
road
was certainly
no
Karawakian
bro
roam
but it's
always
more
complicated
than
certain
identities
like
my
queerness
absolving
us
of what
we choose
to do
and how
we choose
to live
I know
that in
many ways
the stories
that I have
been given
the privilege
to hear
on those
never-ending
highways
they have
never really
been my
stories to
tell
but that
simultaneous
truth
is that
if I had
never
gone
if I
had
never
immersed
myself
in this
damaged
and beautiful
America
if I
hadn't
wanted
to
what
would
the
alternative
have
been
American
hysteria
would not
exist
without
these
years
on the
road
without
an
understanding
of this
nation
that could
only
really
come
from
the
forced
intimacy
of a
ride
of a
passenger
seat
next to
an
inevitably
problematic
American
who
became
suddenly
so
easy
to
love
none
of the
stories
about
the
people
I
met
on
the
road
are
mine
none
of
this
pain
belongs
to
me
and
I
don't
want
to
pretend
that
it
does
but
sometimes
with
these
men
and
women
of
America
I
cried
too
so
many
middle-aged
sad
white
men
with
white
scars
on
their
arms
from
laying
cables
under
ground
who
told
me
about
how
much
they
missed
their
dead
wives
an
army
vet
on
the
way
to
his
beloved
pastor's
funeral
a
woman
with
a
row
of
bright
beanie
babies
staring
out
her
back
window
who
prayed
out
loud
not
unkindly
for
my
salvation
a
self-identified
butch
lesbian
named
Kathy
who
told me
what it
meant
to be
gay
what it
meant
to be
lonely
who
saw
me
before
I could
truly be
brave enough
to see
myself
in that
moment
Kathy and
I were
aching
unwitnessed
together
and we
weren't
entertaining
anyone
our
pain
belonged
to
us
and
so
did
our
love
our
power
there's
another
man
I
remember
a
black
trucker
talking
to me
under
a
neon
buzz
near
the
grinding
jaw
of
rows
and
rows
of
semi
trucks
wearing
a
gold
pinky
ring
he
told me
his
life
story
of
a
pain
I
couldn't
begin
to
understand
swaying
slightly
under
a
shock
of
restless
stars
every
night
he
said
when
his
long
metal
trailer
was
empty
he
played
the
blues
he
played
his
saxophone
in
that
long
echoey
container
alone
it
was a
secret
stageless
place
a place
that no
one
knew
and a
place
we
never
would
this
was
American
hysteria
next
time
on
the
show
we're
covering
another
major
American

misunderstood
