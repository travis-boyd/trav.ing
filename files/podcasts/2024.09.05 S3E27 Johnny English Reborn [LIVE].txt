Conway Hall, please welcome to the stage, Kill James Bond.
Good evening. Hello and welcome to another live episode of Kill James Bond.
Hello.
I am November Kelly. I am joined, as always, by my friends Abigail Thorne.
Hey!
And Devon.
And I'm joined by my friend November.
Singular friend there. That was very rude of me.
Yeah, yeah. Thank you for that.
And we've gathered you all here today so that you can endure a retelling of 2011's Johnny English Reborn.
Yeah, that's what we're doing here.
Just in case that was like, that didn't really jive with what we're doing.
We're just going to talk about a movie we've seen.
Yeah, sort of asking, are the chains really necessary to talk about Johnny English Reborn?
And I have to explain, no, no, this is a part of my, like, power, you know.
No, so we can...
Oh, okay, sure. Maybe after, like, if you're doing anything.
Anyway, so, some of you were here last night for Johnny English.
I hope to see some of you again tomorrow night for Johnny English Strikes Again.
You've recently been cursed by a witch.
You have to see all three Johnny English films.
Some of you are watching on the live stream.
Thank you for that.
You can still buy tickets for Night 3.
You can still buy tickets for the live stream for Night 3.
And we hope to see you then.
However, we developed a theory last night, right, about Johnny English, right?
Which is, when Bond is weak, English is strong.
Yes, yes, yes.
Yes.
He's quite like Melkor in that regard.
Like, when the Valar are weak, he, like, creeps back into the heart of Midland.
Yeah, yeah.
And it's kind of like a semi-official relationship where when Bond is having an off year, then you get a Johnny English movie.
It's why they're filming one now.
Johnny English 4 is being filmed even as we speak.
Dare we imagine?
Just heard someone in the front row go, Jesus Christ.
Yeah, they're going, you know something I had to do.
It's like, Taron Atkinson getting up and going out.
Tell you one thing about this job.
You're never out of work.
You know, they don't stop making bad movies.
Yeah, well, because the reason that the Johnny English and the Bond, like, waxes and wanes is because it's the same guys who write it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Purvis and Wade.
And also...
Did they write this one?
No, they wrote the first one.
This guy was written by the guy...
Oh, that jingling is going to get really fucking annoying.
Was written by the guy who did Flushed Away, so it only remains for me to say...
Fuck off.
You know what it is.
Careful, Whitey!
You should only be able to do one, like, James Bond parody movie.
What?
You get, like, a kind of lifetime limit.
You get a lifetime bat.
Yeah.
No, it's like radiation diving.
Once you've been exposed to it a certain amount, you can't do it again.
Look at what he did to Daniel Craig.
Like, he looks so different now.
Yeah, they were outside this room.
They were like, you've got six seconds to be in the movie Johnny English 2.
Go, go, go!
I serve the United Kingdom.
It's a bunch of people in a ward who are in Johnny English 4.
Right now, they think they're fine.
But in a week, those guys, their faces are going to be coming off.
It's a shame.
It's a real shame.
But so this came out in 2011, which, if you remember, was after Quantum of Solace came out.
When Quantum of Solace came out, people were like, oh, shit.
Oh, fuck.
We fucked on this one.
Bond's a flop.
It's over.
No one likes Daniel Craig.
We have no idea what to do next.
Right?
And it was before Skyfall.
And so to kind of take a breather to build space for themselves, they did Johnny English
reborn.
They fucking reconstituted him as a kind of ablative heat shield for Craig Fingersung.
Yeah.
Like, well, you thought that spy movie was bad?
What if we made a worse one?
It doesn't look so bad now.
It's like fucking negotiating with the Bader-Meinhof gang.
Like, oh, you think it can get bad now, you know.
One Johnny English movie every decade.
So we begin in a smoky room where two men are discussing Johnny English.
Formerly Sir Johnny English.
He's had the title stripped from him.
Formerly King Johnny English.
Yeah.
He got his knighthood stripped from him and he used to be the king.
You can't do that.
If you missed the end of Johnny English 1 last night, he does become king at the end.
Briefly.
Accidentally for like five minutes.
But he is King Jonathan I.
Yeah.
Trades it in for a knighthood and then they take that off him.
He got King Jonathan I, Sir Johnny English and now he's just like a sir.
They like surfed him for this.
They peasantified my boy.
They demoted him to like villain, to peasant.
He's out of here.
He's the only member of the royal family to like ever have any consequences.
Well, Charles I, but only modern member of the royal family to have any consequences.
There's still time.
Yeah.
If you buy tickets now.
So, but yeah, he has to like prestige being a secret agent, right?
Because he has to, he has to always be the underdog.
And so he has to start from zero.
He has to start from peasant.
Yes.
And so these two guys are like, oh, well, you know, we don't trust him anymore after the Mozambique incident.
Which is absolutely a case of from the first movie where you just say a place that sounds foreign.
You know, the fucking.
The Bedouin monks of the Almagreb mountains.
The shaman throat warblers of the Guatemalan Delta.
You know, this type of shit.
They don't really do that again in this movie.
No, no.
Which, thank Christ for that.
Well, he got it out of his system in Mozambique.
We don't know what he did in Mozambique, but it was, it was sufficient to get the knighthood stripped from you.
Which, if you say those words to me, I'm thinking the phrase historical offenses, but.
Yeah, right?
He's actually brought in a new law to prevent vexatious prosecutions against Johnny English.
You can't do it anymore.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He's technically a covert human intelligence source, so nothing he does is illegal, which is grim to consider.
Yeah, because of his enemies being ontologically evil.
Nothing Johnny English does is a crime.
Apart from whatever he did in Mozambique that got him demoted to peasant.
Anyway, these two people in the smoky room, they say, well, the guy that we need to make contact with will only speak to Johnny English.
Presumably he's some sort of awful massacrist.
A boff.
A boff.
A boff.
So we've got to get him back.
Like, where is he?
And we cut to Doctor Strange.
Oh.
Oh.
You thought the first movie was racist.
This.
Sorry, sorry.
I just realized it's Sharon Stone to the front row.
Sorry.
Cards on the table, right?
Of the three, this is the most racist one.
And it indicates that it's the most racist one because we go, well, where could he be?
Yes.
My man is in Tibet.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's in Karmataj.
He's in Shangri-La.
Yeah.
He's looking like a kind of Poundland Stephen Strange, as you say.
He's got the little goatee and everything.
He's got the robes and he's, like, practicing kata and stuff.
He's learning how to use the mind stone.
He's dragging rocks on his nuts.
Yeah.
He's getting kicked in the nuts.
It's a lot of nuts stuff.
Yeah.
It's mostly nuts.
There's a lot of CBT, brackets, cock and ball torture in this monastery.
Like, I'm not sure if it is a monastery, if he's just gone to, like, Tibet's finest club
for this stuff.
But, like, genuinely.
There is a joke that I like where they tie a boulder to his nads and he has to pull
the boulder with it.
And then...
I remember when the GIC made me do this.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They do a couple other things and then they cut back and they've done it with a larger
boulder.
Yeah.
So he's, like, progressing.
It's interesting.
He's jelking.
Yeah, he is.
Yeah.
Off a mountain.
We must imagine Sisyphus.
Must...
No!
No!
How bad do you have to have pissed off the gods for them to be like, you're gonna have
to haul this boulder up a mountain for the rest of time by the testicles?
It'll be, like, an ironic punishment, right?
So he's got to have done something nuts-related in life.
Yeah.
Something nuts-related and extremely hubristic.
Kick Zeus in the nuts, I guess.
Like...
But enough about my work on.
It's like, I've got the biggest nuts in the world.
Maybe even bigger than Zeus.
And the man himself just comes down and is just, like, fucking mountainside right now.
Like Prometheus, the nuts grow back every day.
God, that would be a nightmare.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Goddamn.
But so...
He's learning kung fu from these monks, right?
Which allows me to hit racist noises one.
I have, this time, three racist noise drops, which is an improvement on...
The opposite of an improvement.
What's the opposite of an improvement?
It's an improvement.
We've got way more racist noises.
Let's go.
Let's fucking go.
A decline from one when we had only two racist drops.
But, yeah, because he's, like, sparring with a guy who hits him with this noise.
They can't get enough of this shit.
Like, from tomorrow never dies on.
Like, it's just been the same joke.
And he hits him with a gong, right?
Yeah, they try to introduce this weird theme, which is that Johnny English is not physically
capable, but he is, like, in a sense, like, wise.
He's, like, wise.
So, like, when the guy bows to him before the fight, he just, like, kicks him in the head
as he's bowing.
Which James Bond also did in The Man with the Golden Gun, you may remember.
They do this later on as well, where, like, somebody...
There's, like, some obstacle that would normally be overcome by doing spy shit, and Johnny English
simply, like, walks around it.
So, they're trying to make it out that he's clever.
And I'm like, the whole point of this character is that he's not.
Not anymore.
He's competent as fuck in this.
He's really good at doing spy shit.
Yeah.
Which doesn't seem like...
That's not the same guy.
No.
That's not how the jokes were.
The first one was a guy who, like, accidentally sexually assaulted two women.
Like, that's the level of competence he was operating on, right?
Yeah.
He mistook one of them for a pair of curtains.
It's a terrible movie.
This one, he's just good at stuff.
He's straightforwardly good at stuff.
And I have a theory as to why.
But, so, he completes his, like, jolking training or whatever.
Yeah.
And the head of this monastery...
It's just long as hell now.
You're ready.
The chief monk brings him in and goes,
that shit long as fuck, brother.
So, get out there.
And MI7 needs you back in London.
So, you have to get back on the next plane.
Which he does.
And they do, like, a straight intro sequence.
A straight title sequence.
No Robbie Williams this time.
Lower budget.
And he gets to Toshiba British intelligence because of privatization.
I like this joke.
I thought this was funny.
This is the movie's one joke that hits, right?
Is, oh, the fucking government's privatizing.
A lot of shit these days.
It's almost like there's, like, a Toshiba British intelligence.
Yeah.
And you're just like, yeah, I guess.
The joke is that, like, MI7 has been sold off to Toshiba.
And, like, when he goes in, it's, like, purple.
There's Toshiba spying for you or something.
Yeah.
And when he does, you detect the presence of boomer particles for the first time.
Because previously this had just been racist, right?
But then he goes into the reception and it's a bunch of women wearing call center headsets being, like, you know, like a call center.
And it's like, the joke here is, oh, those are a thing that exist in 2011.
Aren't they annoying?
And you just kind of go.
Oh, was that a joke?
Yeah.
No, fully.
It's meant to be.
It's meant to be that they've got a bunch of people on the phones.
It's like, they literally do a for MI6, press one, for MI5, press two joke in the third one.
It's coming from the same place.
It's kind of funny.
Yeah.
That's wild that the joke is just, like, call centers exist.
That's wild.
It's the most topical humor of 2011, you know?
So, he goes to meet Pegasus, which is, like, M, right?
And they've replaced the last guy with Gillian Anderson, which is always a good decision.
What are you doing?
My note in this one does say, why does Gillian Anderson look so much like Abigail Thorne?
Like, they give her the Abigail Thorne look.
It's very good.
Big fan.
Thank you.
And she's like, all right.
She fully does the bond, you're a piece of shit thing again.
We hate you.
Yeah, she says, well, MI7 is woke and soy and furthermore gay.
Yeah, she says this a bit later on.
She says,
May I remind you all that MI7's current weapon of choice is dialogue?
Its current weapon of choice is dialogue.
Some of the dialogue in this film is a fucking weapon, let me tell you.
But she almost verbatim does the golden, I think.
She says, the guns, the fast cars, and the chauvinism are all on their way out.
And it's like...
She has a yoga ball in her office.
She has a cat.
MI7 has been, like, feminized by force.
Yeah.
He does a bit where he, like, knocks the cat out of the window and then mimes that he has the cat, which does allow me this drop.
There's a good pussy.
Who's a good pussy?
Just in case you needed a...
Good pussy.
Every woman in a Roger Moore Bond film was named, like, Dr. Pamela.
Good pussy.
But so far, we're just doing, like, Bond pastiche, whatever.
Yes, it's very basic.
It's, like, it's 2010s, you know, like, everything is gritty now, even Johnny English.
It's true.
The Bond pastiche continues because who walks in now?
It's Rosamund Pike.
Yeah.
Who you may remember as the extremely hot, fencing, like, villainess from Die Another Day.
And that had already come out by this point, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Long since.
Yeah.
And, like, this establishes a pattern.
She was Miranda Frost.
She was the one who, in Die Another Day, was like,
I'm never going to ever have sex with James Bond.
Oh.
That's about how long it took.
That's what she does in this fucking movie as well.
She's like, I'm not having sex with Johnny English.
We'll not have sex with Johnny English.
First of all, easy promise to make, easy promise to keep.
Yeah.
I will never have sex with Johnny English.
Again, I don't think he's, like, capable.
Like, I think he's going to get into some kind of shenanigans before that gets to happen.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Imagine Rowan Atkinson trying to put on a condom as Johnny English.
Like, that shit's going to be, like, I'm a fucking stealing fan.
To the tune of the Hall of the Mountain King going in the background.
Yeah.
Some of you watched the movie beforehand.
Fucking chicken on his head or whatever.
Like, he's going to slip.
Like, my kitchen's going to be on fire.
And I'm just going to be like, you know what?
Get out.
I'm just going to order a takeaway.
But so Rosamund Pike being in this is part of a pipeline, right?
In that if you're in a Bond movie, not a very good one,
then five years later or so, your fate is to be in a Johnny English movie.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I hate to say it because Olga Kurilenko's in the third one,
which means Johnny English 4, by the kind of, like, law of the pipeline,
has to have Lea Sado in it.
It's just got to.
Oh, yeah.
I was going to say, like...
She's going to be in Malta right now reacting to Rowan Atkinson,
being like, so the way you do this with the condom is very sexy to me.
That's how Lea Sado sounds.
Lea Sado watching the live stream, like, oh, God.
It's genuinely terrible.
So she's, like, a behavioral psychologist, right?
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
And he's going to, like, be monitored by her.
Yeah.
And there's also Agent 1, which is a joke they did in the first one, right?
Agent 1 is 007, James Bond.
He's the, like, Chad agent.
He's our best spy.
Yeah.
And M tells Johnny English, well, so we have a contact.
He's ex-CIA.
And he believes that there is a plot to assassinate the Chinese premier.
And for some reason, he only wants to talk to you, Johnny.
He's a big fan of Blackadder.
He'd love to meet you.
It's literally the plot of Tomorrow Never Dies.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
They just copied the thing.
Mm-hmm.
And he's like, okay, fine.
Well, I'll go through the thing.
But first, we have to have a cue scene.
Yes.
Right.
And we do get a cue.
This is Tim McKinney, who you may remember as Captain Darling in Blackadder Goes Forth.
So.
Knew I fucking recognize him.
Yeah, it's a guy I love to see, to be honest.
Like, he's really doing a good job in this one.
And Q Branch, basically, it's all the same jokes and the Brosnan things.
But, like, it doesn't even have, like, a more comic gloss on it.
It's the same.
It's indistinguishable.
It's Bond with the serial numbers filed off.
Mm.
Yeah.
No, you get, like, there's, like, a sound system and the CD fires out really fast.
There's all sorts of shit.
Brosnan did that one, for fuck's sake.
Very limited number of things.
However, the one joke in this scene is that Q has developed the voice-changing travel lozenges.
Abby, thank you for borrowing a perfectly ordinary Round Freeze Fruit Pastel from me.
I'm sure this isn't a setup to anything.
And so when Johnny English hits the lozenges, he sounds like this.
Crystal clear, Pegasus.
Crystal clear.
The lozenges that voice train you instantly.
Could make a fortune selling this.
You're going to put Claire out of business.
I hate that.
Fucks me off.
I love that I can get them with it every time.
We all get one voice, but in typical Abigail Thorne, the words, she gets two.
She uses dialogue as a weapon.
So Tim McKinney is playing-
Extravagance.
Fuck.
All right, cut it so I say that in the-
Can you just edit all of that?
We can't.
It's live.
It's live.
Stop fucking eating them.
We're not-
No, I need another one so I can go back.
We are not going to do a bit where we all chew into the microphone.
Devs.
I don't have a second voice.
Well, I guess you're going to discover one in real time, you know?
Do you need me to dub you?
Yeah, that would be really fun.
Devon has been voiced by an actor.
I'm going to-
I'm going to take a bite of this and go, wow, they really work.
Give me a second here.
Hi, I'm Devon.
Okay.
That worked very well.
Totally convincing.
I love cider and pleaser heels and I grew up on a farm.
Not true.
And I'm really kind to my friends.
That is true.
That's true, yeah.
That was true.
Vouch.
I know three or four facts about you as well.
Don't ask me now, though.
When you said it like that, it sounded like the Mad Men blackmail threat.
Like, would you say I know something about you, Abigail?
What?
I missed all of that.
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it, kid.
It'll be really funny on the recording.
Yeah.
Christ, I hope so.
If this is funny, sound off in chat right now.
Like, if this is-
Yeah, I hope chat is blowing up.
But I have no way to know.
We also meet our boss.
Oh, yeah, we're doing a thing.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, something about Q, by the way.
We didn't mention this.
Uses a wheelchair, a motorized wheelchair of his own design, right?
Which is pretty much the only way you can get one in England at this point.
It has a bunch of little gadgets in it.
Like, it's the wheelchair that pulls a gun on you,
which, again, I think might be useful in England for disability rights.
Yeah.
Just sometimes down there.
It can go at up to 60 miles an hour and it cuts a little gun out.
Yeah.
The joke is that he lost both legs testing a pair of exploding brogues,
which is kind of-
Yeah, it gets that laugh pretty much.
That's about it, yeah.
Like, if you think the word brogues is funny,
then you get a little laugh out of it.
But so, he shows him the car as well.
Oh, yes.
Oh, Jesus.
Fuck me to-
So, something we mentioned last night, right?
Rowan Atkinson, huge car guy, right?
Like, friend of Jeremy Clarkson, guest on Top Gear, Infinity Times,
owns a bunch of, like, weird cars.
And so, consequently, he used, and this is an improbable sentence to say,
the clout of Johnny English,
to make Rolls-Royce put a V16 engine in one of their cars.
It's one of one.
It's the, like, only one that exists.
It exists because of the movie Johnny English Reborn.
And it exists for fucking Tim McKinnon to go,
look at it, it's fucking cool, isn't it?
Yeah.
And you go, yeah, I guess.
Perfect.
Money well spent.
But it also doesn't really work as a Bond car,
because, first of all, like, a Rolls-Royce is not a sports car.
You can't, like, thrash that round a corner after Le Chiffre
are firing a gun out of it.
It's a fucking Rolls-Royce.
Like, it handles like a fucking tank.
And secondly, like, at least with an Aston Martin,
like, okay, you give James Bond the super-duper expensive Aston Martin,
and then, like, your dad can get the cheaper version of it on finance
if he, like, saved up and really works hard and has a professional job.
Like, I can get the sort of branding.
But, like, you can't afford a Rolls unless you're, like, old money.
Yeah.
Or you've got a lot of residuals from black at it.
But it's aspirational to him specifically.
Yes!
Like, it's not to, like, the dads that are going to be watching.
It's to Rowan Atkinson who's like,
I really want a cool car.
This is the thing.
He becomes Johnny English more and more.
The shit's taking him over like the symbiote.
And this is the point where we really start to see it,
is where he's like,
yeah, I actually really want, like, a V-16 Rolls-Royce.
Like, Boff is the symbiote and they're fused.
Yeah.
Johnny!
Johnny!
Get in the rolls, Johnny!
Do a putt fall, Johnny!
Just a really black, gooey Rolls-Royce.
Fall over, Johnny, it'll be funny.
Rowan Atkinson's entire jaw detaches
and he just, like, eats someone's head.
Okay, I would watch that one, to be fair.
To be clear, Boff, we're referencing Ben Miller,
who was the sidekick in the first movie.
Oh, yeah.
He's not in this movie
because he was funnier than Rowan Atkinson.
He's gone.
He's gone.
And so he was like,
all right, no, fuck this guy.
Fuck this guy.
Get me another guy instead.
Yeah.
And the guy that they get
is Daniel fucking Kaluuya.
You're right.
You're right.
Yeah.
But...
Bear with me.
Aged about, like, 17.
And he's like,
his deal is junior agent.
Yes.
And so the first thing
that Johnny English says
when he looks at Daniel Kaluuya,
the first non-white person
to appear in a Johnny English film,
he says,
I shit you not...
Well, it'll be good
to have somebody to carry the bags.
The shit that they put in
Doctor No.
Johnny.
Yeah, fuck me.
Like, it really is
that we haven't moved on
from Quarrel.
No.
Johnny English is like,
fetch my shoes.
Like, oh, God.
Because the thing is,
the racism in Bonds is actually,
it's not chronological,
it's incremental.
So this being the second one,
it has to have as much racism
as the second Bond movie did.
Oh, wow.
I think you've cracked it.
Yeah, they're going to have to...
I've got the scum scores here.
Have you fucking, like,
algorithmed the scum?
Like, that's fucking...
We're back there with whiteboards.
Fucking hell.
I'm like, I'm locked in on this.
I'm going to get my fucking PhD
in Bondology and Bondonomy
after this.
36-year-old Australian PhD
in Bondology.
There's a Nobel Prize
for media studies in this for us
if we can crack this.
Doing Bondoscropy or something.
Miles Jupp is also here.
Yeah, Miles Jupp shows up
to be like,
has anyone seen the lozenges
that trans your voice instantly
and turn you into sounding
like Abigail Thorne?
Fine.
We love Miles Jupp.
We like a Miles Jupp cameo.
One of the big buff things
is the...
Ooh, a big buff thing.
Wouldn't that be nice?
Wow, okay.
Ooh.
Oh my God.
One of the big buff things
is that he calls Johnny English
Sir the whole time
because he's his power bottom, right?
Yeah.
And they've kept...
A power buff, if you will.
Indeed.
And they've kept that going
with Daniel Kaluuya's character,
Tucker.
There's no sexual relationship
between Tucker and Johnny English.
None at all.
He's actually canonically 20.
I don't blame Daniel Kaluuya
for not wanting to act that.
That's fine.
You know, I respect it.
But he does call Johnny English
Sir the whole fucking movie.
Yeah, Hisson is right.
It's uncomfortable.
You have to picture this
as like a bowstring
that is winding up
towards the most racist line
in the movie
and that's including
the carry the bags line, right?
Oh, Agent One is here also.
That's Dominic West,
McNulty from The Wire,
doing his actual English accent
for once.
And again, they missed the trick.
I said this in the first movie, right?
That like it's an interesting thing
to explore what it's like
working with James Bond
because he's probably a dick.
Instead, in this one at least,
he's just kind of like...
He's a sleaze.
He sexually harasses
Gillian Anderson
like at work
in Q Branch.
But like, he's like,
oh, I love it
when you get strict or whatever.
But like in general,
English likes him
and it's kind of like
you see why
because it's like,
oh, this guy's just charming,
you know?
But so,
they have to go to Macau.
So, first thing you're going to realize,
that's a location in Asia.
So, you're going to get a noise.
All right?
Now,
you know what the noise is
in your head.
You've heard it.
Really, really dealer's choice here.
Do you want two or three?
Give me two.
Right.
Not good.
They go to a casino in Macau.
The joke, again,
is that Tucker,
Daniel Kaluuya,
is like too young
to really be in there.
And it's like,
this is...
This is quite cute.
This is not selling
the deferent
embodied in the kind of
boff English relationship.
Yeah, no,
it doesn't work
to make it like
an actual, like,
senpai-ohai relationship.
It has to be.
Any time an older
and a younger Englishman
work together.
You have to assume
they're in Macau,
which I think is Asia.
And that's the same...
That's what the soundtrack said.
I reckon.
But so,
they're trying to meet up
with a guy
and they're given
the least helpful description ever,
which is,
it's a Chinese guy
wearing glasses,
which in Macau
is probably not
very useful.
And so,
English picks the wrong guy.
And this is funny,
I'm told.
Let me break this one down here.
So,
they walk in
and as they're going in,
there is an old lady.
We don't know her yet.
We will get to know her.
Yeah,
but they fully hit the...
They get told,
right,
the contact is,
you know,
a Chinese fellow
wearing spectacles.
We see the actual contact.
He turns around.
You get this again.
And then,
that guy turns back
and a different guy
sat next to him
turns around
and Johnny,
like,
thinks that guy's
the contact.
But when he turns around,
it once again,
it's a little racist stinger.
I'm like,
stop doing that!
It does not stop doing that.
No,
no.
I lost count.
I started trying to count,
but we lose count fast.
Mm-hmm.
It moves quickly.
Did we mention
the Mozambique racial music?
No,
we didn't.
Oh,
yes.
Incredible.
Okay.
Well,
while we're on the topic.
Yeah.
When M is doing the,
like,
MI7 is woke
and soy now,
Johnny.
More boomer particles,
right?
And she's like,
I actually never wanted you back
because you're not woke
and not soy
and because of the incident
in Mozambique.
And anytime anyone says
the word Mozambique,
you get this little sting
with it.
Mozambique.
Some of the most racist
soundtrack work
I've ever
fucking heard.
Really,
really fucking heard.
And let me assure you,
every time,
every single time
this comes up,
it hits you
with the little drums.
But so,
obviously,
the contact gets killed.
Looking at the credits
and it's like,
original music
by David Dewey.
Yeah.
In the most kind of
throwaway
next location thing,
which is so insulting,
I almost like it,
he's been shot
in the back of the neck
with a, like,
fucking cocktail umbrella
and a poker chip
spills out of his hand
with next location
written on it.
It could have been a text.
Yeah.
May as well have been.
May as well not have
had the scene,
but, you know,
you've got to assemble
a movie out of something.
We didn't have to make
this movie, actually.
Yeah, yeah.
I could be at home right now.
Just doing a live show
for a movie they never made.
It's like,
kind of a zero minute slot.
That's the one they wanted us
to do that about Goncharov,
right,
when that was kind of funny.
Oh, shit, yeah.
And I was like,
no.
I'm glad we didn't do that.
Yeah, me too.
Anyway.
Imagining some of you
out there being like,
yeah,
it was a real moment
in my life
when I went to the
Kill James Bond
Goncharov show.
Me and my wife
actually met at Goncharov.
I made a friend for life
in the queue for Goncharov.
Anyway,
next location
is a lovely,
cheap-to-film-in flat.
Nice.
Much nicer than a casino
because you don't have
to employ background actors.
And we meet Fisher,
who is the former CIA agent.
And also,
the same sinister lady
who the soundtrack
was racist towards
in the casino
is also here,
disguised as a cleaner.
Yeah,
and it hits you
with the same racist noise again
every time she's on.
Yeah.
Every single time
that woman appears on screen,
it hits the little racist noise.
Fisher,
the CIA agent,
is Richard Schiff
from the West Wing.
So, you know,
a guy I love to see.
Shout out to that guy.
And he says,
so in this film,
Spectre,
Ron Atkinson,
it's nice to meet you.
I really enjoyed you
in Blackadder.
In this film,
Spectre is called Vortex.
So we're going to be
calling it Vortex from now on.
We don't have a lot of money.
It's just three of us.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's like a start.
It's an evil startup.
Well, it's a startup.
Yeah, like this is not
an evil organization.
Yeah.
This is post-Quantum Solace
and pre-Skyfall,
which means they didn't have
the rights to the name
Spectre
in Johnny English yet either.
This is Johnny English's
Quantum.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, so it's called Vortex.
There's only three of them.
So, you know,
they're real up-and-comers,
but we think they're
really talented.
And they have a secret weapon,
which is unlocked
by three keys,
and I have one here
because I'm in it!
Which I was like,
ooh,
that's a cool twist.
Yeah.
Never explained or anything.
He's just,
I guess,
just defecting,
you know?
Yeah, yeah.
He respects Johnny English.
He feels bad for Johnny English.
For some reason.
Yeah.
There's a good Daniel Kaleeber.
All the funny Daniel Kaleeber bits
are about how young he is,
so he's, like,
calling his mum right now.
He's, like,
on the phone of his mum
and he sees the, like,
the lady,
the cleaner.
Yeah, she's literally credited
as, like,
killer cleaner.
Killer cleaner.
Killer cleaner.
He spots killer cleaner
and she's, like,
turning her Hoover
into a fucking
scoped rifle or something
and he's like,
oh, mum,
I gotta go,
I gotta go,
I gotta go.
And that's,
I like that.
That is kind of fun.
Yeah,
the sort of Henry Hoover
into a rifle is fun.
Yeah.
Anyway,
she fucking compromises
Richard Schiff
from the West Wing
to a permanent end.
Great shame.
So, I mean,
they're down to two now.
Yeah.
Welcome to the third member
of Vortex,
Matty Lepchansky.
Which one of us
would get taken out first
by, like,
a kind of, like,
racially problematic
assassin?
Which one of us
would try to defect first?
I'd obviously be the one
who defects first.
I'm the bleeding heart here.
You said that
alarmingly quickly.
Why?
I'm not willing
to accuse E-Review
and I want to move on.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Because I'm defecting,
basically,
and I just...
You do love saying
very ominous things,
you know?
Yeah.
It's like,
okay.
If anyone wants to interview
for a role
on Kill James Bond.
You've got to serve
at least this much cunt
to be here, though.
Dev's chair
is going to descend
through the stage
into a shark pit
that we prevent?
Oh, yeah,
like I fall over backwards
into the...
No, it's fine.
You'll run back
into the green room
with booby-trapped
your cider, you know?
It's the one place
we knew you would go next.
I might get some
in a minute.
Yeah.
We'll see.
But so,
because Johnny English
is an oaf,
and again,
the movie can't decide
whether he is or not,
he, like,
runs over,
sees this cleaning lady
and is like,
oh, I shall help her,
like, escape the building.
And it's only when he sees
the, like, bullet casing
in the hoover
that he's like,
wait a second,
she's evil.
And it's like,
Johnny English 1
wouldn't have done this,
you know?
Johnny English 1
would have gotten
stuck in the lift doors
dick first.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, we're about to get
into one of the most
Johnny English
wouldn't have done this
scenes of all time.
I mean,
technically,
the movies where
he does do this
outnumber the one
where he doesn't.
So really,
Johnny English do,
in fact, do this.
We do.
Johnny English does
what James Bond
wouldn't.
Bond didn't, yeah.
With James Bond
darent, possibly.
It's true, it's true.
Well, he's about to do
what James Bond did
because he fully forgets,
he like doesn't get
the key from the guy
that just got killed.
He like runs out
and a different guy
just steals the key
and runs away
and he's like,
fuck, shit, shit.
Oh, yeah,
I love this
because this is the
classic thing
in loads of spy movies
which was,
we now introduce
a character
who is just
a stuntman
in a suit.
Yes.
It's a stuntman,
he doesn't have any lines
because he hasn't trained
as an actor
but he's a very good
stuntman
and he wears a suit
and then he runs away
and it's like,
oh, okay,
now we're going to
have an action scene.
Yeah, yeah,
we've hired a guy
who can free run.
He's going to free run
now for the movie.
Yeah, do you remember
that bit from Casino Royale
where Bond is like
chasing a guy
who's like doing
parkour and flips
and shit?
Wouldn't it be funny
if that again?
Right?
No, not really, no.
There's like maybe
like one joke in it?
Yeah, this is where
they start putting
their like real flag down
for the like,
he's wise
because he's old, right?
Which is cope,
first of all.
Yeah.
You can be a dumb
cunt and be old.
And Johnny English is
and he should be.
But like,
so he's doing the like
Mind Palace
where he's going back
to Tibet
and he just like
starts walking around.
He's like visualizing
himself with a massive
rock tied to his testicles.
If I visualized myself
like that,
I would be in
serious fucking trouble.
That would hurt.
I don't want to visualize that.
No.
It's sort of a
cognitohazard.
Yeah, he just goes around
all the obstacles.
That guy's like
free running over him
and he like opens the door
and walks through.
It's the most like
smug cunt thing ever.
It's pushing off
the fucking smarm score.
Yeah.
Because this guy like
does a bunch of flips
over like a gap
between two buildings
and then he looks back
and Johnny English
and he's like steps over
a much narrower gap
and he's like
boomer.
Boomer.
Boomer moment.
Yeah.
He chases him onto a
there's a yacht chase,
right?
Oh, no.
First of all,
he says a very unusual word
to this man.
Yes.
Because he gets him
at gunpoint on the rooftop
and he goes
Okay, so I don't have
the draw.
What fucking words?
I'm scared.
Oh, yeah, no.
So he gets him
at gunpoint on the rooftop
and he says
hand over the key.
Chimp.
Ooh.
I guess.
I take it to mean
that he's like
clambering over shit.
I guess by analogy
with a chimp's
a chimp's
a chimp's
climbing prowess
but like
that's
chimp's climbing prowess
the climbing prowess
of a chimp.
He's seen our
he's heard our episodes
on Jason Bourne
and he's like
this guy
he doesn't look like
he even has a professorship.
This guy's not even
got his PhD yet.
36 year old
Australian PhD
professor chip.
It's a very
like
I'm in front of
the Goncharov thing
and then I do a joke
about something
that is barely news
now
like this week.
But then they do
the same joke again
because this guy
then backflips off
the thing
and he's climbing
down the scaffold
really dramatically
and Johnny English
just takes the lift
and it's like
this joke is funny
like twice
and then you do
the third time
and it's different.
Like it's not
it's like
set up
and the second thing
and then the third
one's different.
It's not like
just do the same thing
eight times.
It's like
the rule of eight.
Well yeah
let me stop you there
because he does it
a fourth, fifth
and sixth time.
As I learned
from Wikipedia
last night
the essence of humor
is predictability.
So there's a boat chase
at this point.
He gets on a boat
with some expats?
Yeah.
I kind of like this.
He gets on the boat
and he like flashes his ID
and they're just like
fully on board immediately.
Okay yeah sure.
These are like Brits
with a yacht
in like Hong Kong
and I'm like
given that the last movie
suggested that India
was still part
of the Commonwealth
with like a king
like with a British king.
Oh yeah.
I think they reckon
that he's like
they've still got Hong Kong.
Yeah.
Genuinely.
It's like the shit
you know the like
Netherlands retirement home
for people with like dementia
where they build
like a whole fake town.
Yeah.
So that you can continue
to like feel normal
and interact with people
who are like disguised nurses.
Right.
This is like this
for the British Empire.
You know.
The Johnny English movies
you just park
your like aged grandfather
in front of it
and be like
yep still got Hong Kong.
Please stop saying
the things to me.
Do you think
that's what Britain is?
Yes.
Yeah probably.
We're about to get hit
with three tranquilizer darts.
Fucking hell.
The Suez crisis
never fucking happened.
Okay.
We're still on top.
We've got all of the stuff still.
We we we're the first
three British people
to see the walls.
This is.
Like Ed Harris
is going to come out of the sky
and like we're going to like
sail up to the edge
and it's not going to be Calais.
It's just going to be
a fucking wall
and we're in a dome.
The rest of the world is fine.
They just they just
domed Britain off.
No.
I just.
I love that Stephen King book.
I just I just have
this one question right
which is that if Britain's
kind of like a
you know wish fulfillment
fantasy center
why is it so shit.
It's wish fulfillment
for like six guys.
Oh fuck.
If you don't like it
there's no door.
You're stuck here.
God.
No this makes perfect sense.
Okay great.
Well first live show
to make me dissociate
on stage.
It's shit.
That's not true.
Austin Powers
three gold member.
That is yeah.
No.
You can go back.
You can listen.
You'll find it.
But so.
This is another moment
where the movie can't decide
if Johnny English is good
because he has a camera
that shoots exploding darts
right.
And like he got
there's a whole sequence
of him like locking on
to the boat that he's chasing
and I'm like oh obviously
he's going to miss
and like hit a seagull
or something right.
No he just does it.
He just does it yeah.
And then he has a fist fight
with this guy
and like beats him.
Yeah so he like steps
off the boat
onto this like floating platform
right.
And the guy climbs onto it
from having had his boat
exploded.
Which incredibly like
give that man
a Kronstein rosette
first of all.
Oh real.
Oh yeah well yeah
we'll get Kronsteins
at the end.
But like and they just
have a genuine fist fight
and he's good at it.
Like he's just too good.
I just I think that the phrase
Rowan Atkinson fight choreography
is a sign of a seriously
sick society.
But like several goons
jump in to reinforce him
like Johnny English
beats up five people
and I'm like how?
Yeah I installed
the Mr. Bean mod
for fights in tight spaces.
He's too competent.
He's so fucking competent
that they teleport Tucker
from the boat
onto the platform
with him.
The boat is like
50 feet away
and Tucker was on there
doing reaction shots
and he's just on the platform
not wet or anything
fucking whatever happened there.
Tucker's fucking nightcaller.
Entirely so
he can do the comedy fight
and go like
oh I'm gonna beat you up
and I get hit once
and fall over
and it's like
they have offset
the Johnny Englishness
onto Tucker
because he's being
too competent
and they still want
a pratfall in the scene
but they can't put it
into the actual
fight choreography
because he's too good.
They should have had him
like win by accident
like he like
you know
trips on his shoelaces
and knocks over a ladder
or something like
I'm generating
like a better fucking
sequence in my head.
The thing too
with the Daniel Kaluuya
right is that
he gets trapped
into more reaction shots
in this movie
than in Get Out.
It's
every fucking scene
is Rowan Atkinson
doing some cool shit
and Daniel Kaluuya
going like
and it's like
this fucking sucks
like he's a good actor
he's a better actor
than Rowan Atkinson
put him in the movie
please maybe.
Long and short of it
is that Johnny English
wins and they get
the key right
so they're like
right we're gonna
go back to London
we've prevented Vortex
from getting the key
to their secret weapon
so I mean
they need all three
we've got one
jobs are good.
They're on the flight back
they're sitting in first class
and I'm like
I don't think MI7
pays you to fly first class.
Also first class
used to be a lot more shit
than it is now
based on like
YouTubers and stuff
these days
they give you like
a whole little cabin
they just have like
economy seating
it sucks.
And so Tucker's like
I need to write
the mission report
because I'm a nerd
and I'm very like
straight laced
and Johnny English
is like
nah it's fine
just fucking
have some champagne
it's chill.
Also his job
was to write the reports
in the first one
like whatever.
He sexually harasses
the flight attendant
I forget what
the actual line is
but it works
on her as well
which is more
wish fulfillment.
Like he kind of
rizzes up the flight attendant
and she's like
she smiles like
indulgently
like she's into it
and I know that's like
part of the job
kind of
or at least it was
in 2011
but like Jesus man.
Then she gets
knocked out by a goon
and is presumably like
oh thank god
I don't have to talk
to Johnny English anymore.
Which meant
that they kind of
staged a partial
plane hijacking
in order to do this
next bit.
And that doesn't really
come up you know.
Just a little bit of one
you know.
It's an odd plan
by the goon as well
because the goon
knocks out the air hostess
and then takes her uniform
Yeah.
Agent 47
you know
is much woker now.
Yeah.
Not sure where he places
her body
which presumably
is now undressed.
Presumably like
yeah naked body
hmm.
Slightly odd.
Anyway
and then goes
and is just like
oh can I take this case
with the key in it
from you?
And like Daniel Kaluuya
instantly like spots
this person's wearing
a name tag with Susan
written on it
and Daniel Kaluuya's like
I don't think that's a Susan.
We were all braced.
We were like
yeah all three of us
were like uh oh.
But wait it's 2011
and they haven't invented
being transgender yet.
That's exactly it right
because Johnny English 4
is going to have
a trans joke.
It's going to have
at least one.
Johnny English 2
it would have done
They didn't know.
But they didn't know.
We hadn't been invented
by the government yet
so like
they just
instead they're just like
oh no that's simply
a Chinese name
Shushan.
It's like weighing up
the two things
like trans joke
racist joke
trans joke
always zigging
racist joke.
Yeah rare like
transphobia racism fake out.
Yeah.
I'm morally neutral
on that I think.
Yeah yeah
I don't really
anyway
they go back to London
and of course
Johnny English
is doing a big presentation
like I have the key
and they're never
going to get their hands
on it
and here it is
everybody
and it's fucking
empty right.
Great.
Resummon Pike
is also here
for some reason.
Yeah.
We also see the key
being handed off
to
Berne Gorman
one of the faces
of all time.
Guy I love to see.
Love to see Berne Gorman.
Guy who looks like
a nasty little freak
is like an actor
it's a type of actor
you don't see
cast very often
as much as you should
like they used to cast
whole genres
with like
this is a guy
who looks like
a nasty little freak
I picked him up
off the street
he's going to be
in 50 film noir movies
you know.
We used to be
a fucking country.
Yeah.
Germany I guess.
Now we're down
to like one guy
who looks like
a nasty little freak
I'm sorry if you're
listening
or watching.
It's great casting
he looks like a villain
it's like a great
evil henchman
great got it
but not like evil henchman
fighting
evil henchman computers
it's really good casting.
Yeah.
Important to have a strict
division of labour.
This meeting is taking place
in Pegasus' house
whilst her
like child
is having her birthday party
because she's fucking
feminised.
I'm so fucking annoyed
at this right
because the way
that they have her
like family
and her kids
intrude
and she has to like
put her kids
back in the kind
of party room
they didn't pull
this shit
with M
right
like
M was not a high bar
for like a kind of
you know
very deeply written
female character
but to be like
oh well she's
like the first
female director
of Johnny English
MI7
she's woke
and she kind of
doesn't have
work life separation
because like
even the married
to her work thing
that they did
with M
in the Bond movies
was a different
kind of terrible
this is just like
it just stinks.
She's like
oh what if
the head of MI6
was a woman
I bet she'd
take meetings
at home
and there'd be
kids coming in
and all that.
It's boomer shit
it's boomer shit
again.
It's boomer shit
she's got a cat
oh it's gay
and to be a woman.
Yeah.
I mean to be
to be fair
that has been
my experience.
Yeah.
That's the original
tagline of Kill James Bond
actually.
In many ways
I wasn't gay
until I became a woman.
I managed a bit
beforehand
but just hits different
you know.
Shout out for gay
big fan of gay.
And I shout out
to women.
For a fucking second
I thought you
weren't going to do it.
Wait wait wait
we can do this together.
Shout out for men.
Oh you failed me
I was expecting nothing.
Hey hey hey
there are some cool men.
Yeah.
And they're like
four or five.
Yeah.
So.
Six months time
we do another live show
and we shout out to men
and there's like
slightly fewer voices.
Or slightly more
you know
it maintains itself
I think.
Hmm
that's reasonable.
But so
at this point
The cleaner
the cleaner is here.
You better believe
they hit you with the
It's a much shorter one
it's just a little
It gets longer
That's specifically
that's the noise you get.
It gets longer
and worse
every time.
Yeah like
are you editing these?
Yeah.
Yeah which is fucked up
because like
you already know
that it's her
because of the
Hoover sound.
And because it's
the same woman.
Yeah.
Because they show her face.
Well
actually
they don't.
They just show
Don't worry
I only noticed
I'm building shit.
I'm watching Johnny English.
She like
just starts
hoovering
and all that
Johnny sees
is like
someone using
the Hoover
like just
the Hoover
itself
comes past the door
and he is
activated immediately.
He's like
I'm gonna
fucking kill
whoever that is.
He just happens
to be proven right
because she throws
like three knives
at him.
Wrong.
Well he gets
the wrong person
because he accidentally
attacks
Fuck out of here.
Jesus
alright.
He accidentally
attacks like
M's mum
who is just
an old lady
who's doing
the Hoovering.
He gets attacked
by the cleaner
first
and then
as she flees
he attacks
M's mum
by accident.
Thank you.
No I think
they do the joke
twice.
They genuinely
like
They do the joke
twice.
He attacks
a person
with the Hoover
and he's like
this is the
assassin from Hong Kong
and they're like
that's my mum.
He's then forced
to go into the kitchen
and apologise
to Pegasus' mum
and that's when
she turns around
and she really
is the killer.
It's okay
I only know this
because I wrote
it down specifically
because like
there was no reason
for him to attack
that woman.
Yeah.
You're so right.
There's absolutely
no reason
you would have
to assume
that the person
using a Hoover
in like
M's house
is the same
assassin from Macau
who also just
uses a Hoover.
He has
he has triggers
you know
it's just that
they happen to be
like dangerously
misogynistic.
Yeah so he grabs her
and he goes into the room
he's like
I've got the one
who killed the fella
in wherever it was
and that's my mother
you know.
It sucks.
And then they do it again
they do the same joke again.
Anyway this is the point
at which Pegasus
is just like
you're fired Johnny English
you suck
we all hate you.
Rosamund Pike
is like
I believe you
for some reason.
She's a behavioural
psychologist.
Oh no she says
you're showing all
four markers
of a person
telling the truth.
Yes.
Which goes totally
unquestioned right
and we then see
what the movie thinks
behavioural psychology
is right
because she sneaks
him into MI7
after hours.
What are the four markers
of someone telling the truth?
Charisma,
uniqueness,
nerve and talent.
B-boying,
emceeing.
Smarm cultural
sensitivity.
Unprovoked violence
and misogyny.
Yeah yeah.
God why are people
telling the truth
always horrible?
But so she sneaks
him into MI7
and she hooks him up
to the fucking
Hexcorp branded
sissy hypno.
She hits him
with the hypnodon thing.
She does
and she goes
listen
whenever I mention
Mozambique
a bunch of really
racist soundtrack
cuts in
and you do this
weird twitch
right
and part of my deal
is that people
kind of tend to
leak emotionally
through their faces.
Emotional leakage.
Yes.
Use the word.
To which English
hits her with
I don't leak.
Fucking
me refusing
to take part
in Welsh patriotism.
It's fine.
Listen
it happens at that age
okay.
There's no shame
in just getting
like an adult diaper.
You don't get wiser
when you get older
you just get more
likely to piss yourself.
Honestly
he's had so much FFS
like there's a lot
of nerve damage
going on
like he can't even
he's got no idea.
It's so sad
like you kiss
Johnny English
you can't feel it.
I mean
it fully is the
consequently
we are vitally
concerned with
unauthorised leakages.
So she puts him
in the fucking
sissy hypno machine
and says the word
Mozambique to him
and we get a bunch
of like
weird facial expressions
and she says
There.
Could we call that
leakage?
You ever see
an entire auditorium
full of people
get a kink
at the same time?
Anyway
this is the
flashback machine
Johnny English
it's time for us
to flashback
to Mozambique now.
Yes.
And so we see
what happened
in Mozambique
that he was
the head of security
for the new
president of Mozambique.
Yes.
And then a sexy lady
was just like
ooh Mr. English
would you like
to shake
in the hot tub?
I love
the hot tub.
Jacuzzi.
We have big plan
you know.
And he's like
you know what
I would like
to not pay attention
to my job
and be distracted
by firm
large titties.
So I will.
Yeah and then
I'm so often
saying this
to be fair.
While they're
in the jacuzzi
one of the
president's
bodyguards
pulls a gun
on him
and shoots
him in the back
which means
that the movie
Johnny English
Reborn
kind of predicted
the assassination
of the Russian
ambassador
to Turkey.
Just one
for the real
geopolitics heads
out there.
RIP
Andrey Karloff
you know
I know
you're looking
down on us.
Yeah yeah yeah.
And whilst
he's having
this flashback
he's like
oh
Vortex
were in Mozambique
I remember
Fisher was there
and then there
was another guy
whose face
I can't remember
yet because
it's not time
for me to
remember that.
But then
the third one
was a KGB
guy called
Artem Kalenko.
Yeah Russian
Gaevich.
Yeah Russian
Gaevich.
What genuinely
one of the most
Russian Gaevich's
of all time.
He does also
hit on
Rosamund Pike
while he's under
while he's in
trance.
He says the
words plump
pillows.
If a man
said the word
plump pillows
about me
I think I would
be forced to
execute him
in self-defense.
And so
yeah she's
charmed again
like he's a hit
with women in
this one for
some fucking
reason.
Yeah why?
I gotta get
another drink.
Reasonable.
We can
contractually
Careful.
Contractually
we can oblige
them to do
the whole show
but not to be
on stage for
the whole time.
We can't oblige
them to remain
sober during
Johnny English 2.
If you're
fucking defecting
back there I
swear to God.
I promise I'm
not defecting
back there.
Defecting to
another podcast.
Put the scorpion
in their chair.
Fuck.
You're good.
You're good.
What's going on
here?
No don't
worry about it.
That's a lot
of ass.
It's all good.
I got the
official beer
of driving.
That's a lot
of you.
So you
remember how
in Goldfinger
because this is
just a pastiche
of Bonds
Bond has to
like golf
with Goldfinger.
Well he has to
golf with
Russian Gaevich
and they
make Daniel
Kaluuya
caddy
for him.
Sorry I
really want a
sponsorship.
So sad.
My notes say
nobody will be
seated during
the riveting
golf scene.
It's just
it edges
closer to
Rowan Atkinson's
interests and
the things that
Rowan Atkinson
wants to do.
They just sort of
film this around
him I think.
Yeah.
Is he aware
that he's in
this?
In the same
way that we're
aware that we're
in Britain.
Yeah.
The kind of
reality fiction
distinction gets a
bit fuzzy around
him.
The killer
cleaner is here
disguised as a
golfer so they
of course hit you
with the.
Just a bunch of
guys like thinking
really hard about
how to be like
racist about golf.
Yes.
She has a golf
club gun which is
cool.
That is quite
fun.
Yeah.
She's got good
gadgets.
They don't
draw attention to
the gadgets at
all but like
she's got some
pretty cool gadgets.
She shoots
Russian Gaevich
and English and
Tucker have to
evacuate him in
a helicopter and
this is the
apotheosis in this
movie of being
good at stuff.
Right.
Because you don't
get points for
being comically
bad at flying a
fucking helicopter
that's still
impressive.
Yeah.
I feel like if
you live you've
flown the helicopter
well.
Yes.
Yeah.
anything above the
like Colin McRae
performance of
flying a helicopter
is still impressive.
Frankly even that
was kind of
impressive and then
abruptly stopped
being impressive
right.
Like.
They do get the
one moment in the
movie where I
laughed which is
that they're trying
to get into a
hospital and they
don't know which
way the hospital
is so they just
like fly down to
about a foot off
the road and
follow the road.
Yeah this is a good
bit.
Follow the road
signs which I do
think is quite
funny.
It's really
impressive stunt
work again for
that joke which I
did not laugh at
and I'm just like
you got a guy to
fly a helicopter
like an inch off
the ground for
this you know.
It's like pearls
before swine this
movie.
Yeah he's like
keep him alive
try something else
to Daniel Kaluuya
and he starts like
singing at him
which is funny.
It was funny.
And like Johnny
joins in with the
singing and it
hits the soundtrack.
It was fine.
This was good.
This was the one
good scene in the
movie.
Typically you want
a higher hit rate
than that but
that's you know
it's fine.
But they do nail
one per film.
You hate to hand
it to them.
I'm okay.
At this point
they get him to
the hospital and
you know NHS
cutbacks being
what it is still
has to wait
outside for a
bit and of
course dies while
this is happening
but like before
he does he's
like Vortex was
three dudes.
One of them was
the CIA.
One of them was
KGB.
That's me
helpfully.
And one of
them was
dead.
He does
actually say
MI7.
Yeah he comes
back after the
death scene to be
like and MI7
and then dies
again.
It's great.
and it should at
this point be
obvious.
It's the only
other guy in the
movie.
Yeah.
Johnny English.
So at this
point.
Who keeps
fucking everything
up for MI7?
Yeah.
English has to
go back to
MI7 and we
see the prime
minister who has
changed into a
kind of Cameron-esque
figure.
Yeah I'm
fascinated by the
fucking prime
minister in this
because they've
clearly tried to
go for David
Cameron.
Yes.
But they've
made it like
movie David
Cameron so he's
like much more
attractive and
competent than the
real guy.
Yeah.
And he just
occupies this
really fucking
weird space of
like what if
David Cameron was
good?
It's just kind of
technocracy because
this prime minister
is like I just
have to do
rapprochement with
China.
Do you think
David Cameron ever
said the words
rapprochement with
China in his
fucking life?
No.
But anyway the
prime minister is
like we need to
meet with the
Chinese premier in
order to like
contain rogue
rapproch you
know?
Yeah.
In order to
like contain
rogue states in
Southeast Asia who
have nukes.
Yeah.
And then he's
like hold on
Southeast Asia?
Yeah.
Because obviously
they're going for a
North Korea thing
here.
That's not where
that is.
That's not where
that is.
What are they to
East Timor maybe?
Like what's the
rogue state in
them?
The Laotian
atomic bomb
program.
Ridiculous.
Yeah.
And also
Rosamund Pike is
there because she's
going to be in
these meetings
because the
official position of
the British
government in this
movie is that the
Chinese government
is so like
inscrutable that
they need to do
body language shit
on them to
understand how the
negotiations are
going.
She says to
not Cameron about
the Chinese premier
it's all about the
eyes with
Shang Ping and
it's just like
come on man.
Half of these guys
went to fucking
Oxford.
It's like
the other weird
thing is like
David Cameron says
well the Chinese
premier will only
meet us if we can
guarantee his
security.
Do it in China.
That's what I
thought.
Meet him in
fucking China.
Do you know
where it's pretty
secure?
Like fucking
China.
Now it's your
problem.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Do your own
security then mate.
Oh I'll tell you
what let's do it
on Zoom.
Easy.
But at this
point agent one
who's like hello
I'm definitely not
the villain of the
film.
What if we meet
in I don't know
fucking Switzerland
for some reason.
Cool.
Great.
Whatever.
This cool like
bastion up a
mountain in
Switzerland.
I'm like okay
cool.
We'll lock that
in.
And then he
takes English
out for a
meal.
At the end of
which he
sexually harasses
the waitress
and English like
piggybacks on the
sexual harassment.
They like bond
by sexually harassing
a waitress.
It's cool.
So what would
you like for
dessert and agent
one hits you
with the bloody
you.
And Johnny
goes bring
two spoons.
Which is
which really
makes it sound
like they're
just in a
like looking
for a third
like canonically
like kind of
looking for a
unicorn.
They go to the
bathroom together.
I do quite like
this moment where
Johnny is like look
Simon I've got to
tell you something.
I've heard that
there's a mole
inside MI7
and supposedly
it's a pretty
senior guy
and I just want
to ask you a
very serious
question.
I want you to
be honest with
me.
And we see that
under the table
like Simon's got
a fucking gun
and he just
goes do you have
any fucking
idea who it
is?
Yeah I do like
that.
Yeah to be fair
that is quite
funny.
That's good.
So they go to
the bathroom
together?
Question mark.
No.
Do they not?
Yeah don't worry
he gets a text
from Tucker.
You can't just
hit me with a
full force no
and then be like
don't worry.
Well don't worry.
I'm worrying.
Oh okay that's
fine.
No Tucker gives
him a text and
they go because
they have to have
a little chat
before he comes
in.
Yeah yeah yeah.
Yeah like meet
me in bathroom.
Oh yeah and
then Tucker's like
it's Simon.
Simon's the villain
and Rowan Atkinson
says it can't be
him.
He went to
Eton and I'm
like oh no
British person
who's evil
has ever been
to Eton before
like come on.
Very strongly the
first two reels
of Tinker
Taylor Soldier
spying.
contained in that
line you know
like it can't be
him he had to
fucking Eton.
At which point
Simon himself
agent one walks
in and Tucker
holds him at
gunpoint and
explains the plot
of the movie to
him and it's
like I know
you're evil right
I can smell
crime or
whatever.
Referencing a
tweet about
Jason Statham
this is the way
that my brain
works sometimes.
He goes you
said you'd
never met
Russian guy
bitch but I
found a photo
of you on
Facebook with a
big fish
you were clearly
on a fucking
swimming trip.
Yeah.
You seemed like
real tight homies
actually.
Would have been
funnier.
And we see that
Simon pulls some
bullshit out of
his ass he's like
actually I work
for a counter
mole secret
organization within
MI7 and he
like invents a
name off the top
of his head by
reading the
urinals as though
it's called
Armitage.
and then like I'm
definitely not evil
actually and he's
like sweating
bullets and
Johnny English is
like I completely
believe you go
home Daniel
Tuluya.
Yeah he doesn't
just say go
home.
He doesn't just
say that yeah.
Because the
bowstring leading
to the most
racist line in
the movie has
been loosed
because what he
says is
you're in way
over your head
boy now run
along.
Boy.
Now.
That's real bad.
They try to
contextualize it in
the next line as
a kind of school
teacher thing by
being like you've
let me down you've
let the school
down and frankly
I think you've
let yourself down
but I just
screenwriting
software typically
has a backspace
button.
If you if you
find you've
written yourself
into a corner
and it's a racist
corner.
Clippy pops up
and is just like
don't know about
that one chief.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Don't know if
you can be typing
that.
Yeah.
You can't be
typing like that
white Johnny.
Like if you
write yourself
into a racist
hole you don't
have to then
just be like
careful whitey.
Yeah.
You don't have
to then just have
the next line be
like not racially
though.
Like you can just
you can take that
out of there
and write a
different line.
You don't have
anyone on staff
that is telling
you that calling
this fellow boy
is not a good
fucking look.
Like nobody
to script
doctor this?
Seemingly not.
No.
They had lost
Purvis and Wade
back to Bond
at this point.
So it's not
even on them.
It's just
it's one guy
being like
I've written
myself into
a racist
corner but
I write
myself out
of racist
corners too.
At this point
we get this
like really weird
class subplot
because Simon
says like okay
the real mole
is Q
from the
earlier scene.
Remember him?
He said
I heard he said
about you
Johnny
that you
are a
jumped up
grammar school
nobody.
It's like
such a specific
English class
B.
Fascinating insight
into the
boomer mind
you know
to be like
this is the
greatest horror.
The worst thing
anyone can be
told
is to a
fucking
jumped up
grammar school
nobody.
Not state school
not even state school
grammar school
like that's the thing
you're not allowed
to be.
It's like
you're middle
class.
Not middle
class enough.
Fuck you.
It's realistic
I suppose.
I mean I went
to a private
school that
existed to get
beaten at rugby
by Eaton.
And let me
tell you
Etonians
hate people
like that
way more
than they
hate state
school people
most of the
time.
It's a strange
dynamic.
You went to
a Washington
General's
Yes.
They were
dunking on us
with ladders.
Got tackled
by an Etonian
and you'd break
like your entire
pelvis.
Yeah it was
crazy.
I was actually
banned from
playing rugby
at my school.
Yeah because
of being
transgender.
In many ways
you were the
Iman Caliph
of nothing.
Not even trans
that joke
doesn't work.
I broke
someone's nose.
So again
what are you
doing later?
They said
something mean
to me.
From then on
it was ping pong.
I was doing
fencing
to get out
of rugby.
I did fencing
outside of
school time.
I didn't do
nothing.
It was not
very sporty
as a child.
Just didn't do
it.
So at this
point.
I went to a
state school.
Yeah right
there's one of
us.
Aberyst
with university
fucking sound
off boys.
H bomber guy
went there.
I don't know
of anyone else.
I dropped
out of
Glasgow
uni if
anyone's a
big fan of
that.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Big alumni
of Glasgow
university
Nicola
Sturgeon
until recently.
They de-alumni'd
her?
St Andrew's
University.
It happens.
It happens
to the best of us.
One of the
former
rectors of
St Andrew's
University
is Rowan
Atkinson.
And if
you're watching
you can be
here tomorrow
night.
Actually the
students of
St Andrew's
recently asked
me to run
for rector
which would
have been
very funny.
I would
have loved
to if I
had the
time.
Nobody's
asking me
to run
for shit
these days
you know.
Sucks.
Like they're
just asking
me to run
just in
general
but like
get out
of here.
I just
get a text
every so
often it
just says
run.
So as
the Bond
movies get
grimmer and
darker and
more serious
we had to
do the
mandatory bit
of every
British media
product where
we talk about
which school
and uni we
went to.
Just so you
know how to
categorise this.
As the
Bond movies
get more
grim and
serious so
do the
Johnny English
ones.
So they
play a
relatively
straight
scene where
English
confronts
Q in
church and
is like
you're the
defector and
Q's like no
you are and
the trap
closes around.
Agent 1 has
gone on
call after
the end of
a scene and
been like I
figured out who
the mole is
it's Johnny.
Yeah and
they spring the
trap on him.
Luckily
English has
learned in
the monastery
one of
James Bond's
powers.
The power
of exploit
disability.
Hmm.
Must have been a
rough few days
teaching that
at the
monastery.
I'll tell you
that.
Throwing a
dummy out of
a wheelchair.
Because that
is basically
what he does.
He fully
just like
dumps Tim
McKinney out
of his
wheelchair and
steals it.
Like he
wheelchair
jacks him.
What I
appreciate is
that they
are not
fucking around
at all.
No they
shoot to kill.
The other agents
that are in that
church are
shooting to
kill.
Yeah they're
not using
gas.
Like they're
like bullets.
Yeah.
Like we're
going to
compromise
Johnny
English to
a fatal
end.
And if
they do a
little chase
down the
mall in
the gadget
wheelchair.
Yeah.
Again this
is like this
must have been
so much work
to film.
It's quite
like competently
done in terms
of like stunt
driving and
stuff.
And it just
the joke
sucks.
It's not
good.
Yeah.
Like there's
one slightly
funny bit where
there's a queue
of people using
wheelchairs outside
a disabled
toilet and
Johnny English
goes to the
front of the
queue and
they're like
you're pushing
in the queue
for the
toilet.
And then like
he just pulls
a gun on
them.
I would also
like to do
that if
anyone ever
challenges me
in a public
bathroom.
This is not
an ethical
use of the
wheelchair gun.
But so
he escapes
with the aid
of the very
fast wheelchair.
And again
they have a
shot in this
that could
have fully
decapitated
a stunt
performer for
the sake of
Johnny English
too.
And I'm
like whatever
they're paying
you for that
it's not
enough.
It's not
going to have
been enough.
Yeah.
No they like
close him off
with a truck
and he hits
a button on
the wheelchair
that makes it
like flattened
down and he
goes under the
truck.
First of all
too confident.
Second of all
we didn't know
the wheelchair
could do that.
So it's not
satisfying to
see him do
it.
No.
But he
then invades
the house of
one Rosamund
Pike.
Yeah.
My note just
says you used
to be able to
afford a London
flat like this
for like five
pounds a month
bills included.
God it's such
a nice flat.
It's really
nice.
I don't think
they pay MI7
behavioural
analysts like
that much
money.
No.
Do they?
Are any of you
in?
I guess maybe
don't say if
you are.
That's not a
good idea.
Do you want
to just like end
your entire
career for one
laugh on a
podcast live
show?
That could be
funny right?
Worthwhile.
Just if you're
out there let the
intrusive thoughts
win one time.
Think of us like
the War Thunder
forums right?
like.
Constantly we are
vitally concerned
with unauthorised
leakages.
There we go.
So yeah she is
of course shocked
to see him there
but the Johnny
English Riz wins
out.
You know she can
tell that he's
telling the truth.
She's got powers
like the lady
from Poker Face.
Yeah.
She like goes
back in she like
puts him back in
trance right?
In hypnosis.
It's like I need
you to remember
who the third
fucking guy was.
This mysterious
Dominic West
shaped man.
Who could he
have been?
And he goes yo
that's McNulty
from The Wire.
Oh my god.
Yeah throughout
this we're getting
cutaways to Dominic
West.
He's using the
keys.
The three keys
he's put them
together into one
key.
He uses it to
open a box.
There's a vial
in there.
For a second I
was just like oh
it's estrogen.
You can't get
injectable estrogen
in the UK unless
you assemble like
three keys.
Yeah.
We've each got
part of a key.
The only way to
get estrogen is to
kill us all.
They're piecing
this together in
Rosamund Pike's
apartment as well
because they're
like well Fisher
was working on a
classified project
using a chemical
which is really
difficult to
pronounce and
we're going to
derive a lot of
comedy from the
fact that it's
really really
difficult to
pronounce.
Yeah sometimes
it's spelled with
an O in front
in English.
It's fucking
tamoxilin
barbabutinol.
It's not that
difficult.
Off the dome.
Right off the top
one of the main
things you're going
to notice about
tamoxilin
barbabutinol is
there's a lot of
B sounds in there.
Right?
And that's the
fucking bread and
butter of Johnny
English.
The voiced
bilabial plosive
strikes again.
Barbabutinol.
Shut up.
And what tamoxilin
barbabutinol does?
Three out of three
we nailed it.
Thank you.
It puts somebody
in a trance
brackets not sexy
it kind of like
poppers them up.
Imagine if there
was a drug that
put someone in a
trance that would
never be sexy.
And then they do
whatever they're
told to do when
they're high?
Yeah imagine that
being sexy.
I can't personally.
If you have any
thoughts about how
that could be sexy
keep them to
yourselves.
You know.
Crazy.
Disgusting.
But then you do
also die after 15
minutes.
You do die
afterwards.
Well.
I mean.
You know.
What are you doing
in those 15 minutes
though?
That's the question.
Yeah I mean.
Yeah.
The real question is
what am I going to
do for the other
12 minutes?
Usually.
Usually like.
Don't clap for me.
Oh yes.
Crying and
dissociating.
No no.
I can top.
I swear.
Jesus.
It's fine.
So.
We do get a little
cutaway scene where
we see.
You didn't see me do
that as well.
I got away with
that.
Someone has hired
like.
Agent Wong.
Whatever his cunt
is.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Him.
Someone has hired
this guy to kill
the Chinese premier.
And we see that
the guy is a guy I
love to see.
Benedict Wong.
Yeah.
Does not return.
You're right.
Does not return in
this movie.
It's just like they
just needed a
character to be the
one who hired him.
Totally.
Totally wasted.
You know.
Absolutely wasted.
Sucks.
He also.
He's paying him
500 million dollars
which is like very
expensive for an
assassination.
I guess if it's the
premier of China.
That's a huge
fucking markup.
You can get an
assassination for like
anywhere between
15 to 50 grand.
Like you don't need
500 million.
I got the Timu
political assassination.
You fucking imagine.
It was just a guy
with a bunch of shit
he built in his garage.
It actually worked
really well.
Value for money.
I would be so
fucking mad if I
got assassinated and
they like paid him
15 grand.
Like what the fuck
man.
Yeah.
What's it.
Wait.
So much more than
that.
But like a hundred
five to 50.
Pushing like top
end.
Like I don't know.
It just seems it
seems like a lot of
money.
Well see it's not
your dad's
aspirational
assassination.
It's Rowan
Atkinson's.
The Rolls Royce
of yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right.
My next note is
Rosamund no don't.
Yeah.
By which we can
assume that he's
getting the girl.
He gets the girl.
He fully gets the girl.
Yeah she suddenly
fancies him for no
reason.
Well it's because
there's a deleted
scene in the credits
where he chops a bunch
of vegetables to in
the hall of the
mountain king that's
apparently funny and
makes her be like I
should fuck this man.
Yeah she's like oh
since the start
Johnny I've been I
was had a I had a
professional interest
in you which is funny
as a behavioral
psychologist to be like
I was fascinated by
what the fuck was
going on with you.
I thought now that's a
freak I can get my
fucking teeth into.
This is like the
mother of all
counter transference I
swear to god like the
safeguarding that they're
doing non-existent.
Yeah but over time I've
decided that I have
actual romantic feelings
towards you.
Ew.
Gross.
Yeah ew.
Don't do that.
The first time she met
this guy he was going
there's a good pussy
who's a good pussy.
And I guess that had
some kind of like
neuro-linguistic
programming subliminal
effect.
The first time they
met he threw a cat
out of a window.
Maybe she's just really
into animal cruelty.
Yeah she hates animals.
Just hybristophilia.
Like she's just
I don't know.
I believe agent one
shows up at this point.
Yes he does.
Simon appears.
She like locks him
in a bedroom.
She does something
which I'm very weak to
which is the posh girl
wave.
Like she's like stay there.
And I'm like
fuck okay.
Wait what's the posh girl
wave?
It's like this.
Like yeah.
Yeah.
It's cunty.
And it has a powerful
effect you know.
So he looks out the
window just
writing down practice
posh girl wave.
She
She gets in the car
with agent one
and Johnny English
looks out of the window
and sees agent one
who looks up at him
and fucking like
makes him instantly
and it's like
I know you know
that I know that
you know that
I know that
you know that you're
watching.
Cunt.
He says all of that too.
It's a great line.
Well Johnny English
is looking out of the window
and he sees this guy
from the back above
and goes like
oh shit that's the guy
from Mozambique.
Cool man.
Yeah anyway.
But like the lights
are off right
and we hear
the hoover
and I go
oh nice
okay that's
that's the noise
that we play
to let us know
that she's
in the fucking
And it hits me
with this afterwards
and it's like
I heard the hoover
and I've put together
who it is.
Yeah.
M's mum.
Yeah.
Anyway she's here
she's got a hoover again.
It's a chainsaw
this time.
It's a chainsaw.
She's trying to like
gears of war
his ass.
Yeah.
Like he like
hides in the bathroom
and she like
chainsaws through the door
and you get
like a split second
where they've shot it
like the shining scene
of the fucking dance.
It's quite fun.
It's kind of funny.
Yeah yeah yeah.
I was like oh.
He how does he
fucking defeat her
because I don't know.
He does.
Might not say
but he just runs away.
He literally just dips.
She is an old woman.
He goes nah fuck that.
He just runs away.
Okay.
And this one he goes
to Tucker's flat
and he says
Tucker.
Where Tucker is gaming.
Yeah.
He's playing like
Gran Turismo or something.
Yeah yeah yeah.
It's kind of fun.
And he says
Tucker we were right
and I do like
that they do give
Daniel Kaluuya
this memory
he gets to go
we?
We were right
you motherfucker.
Like and then
then there's this
bizarre moment
where Johnny English
tries to appeal
to his sense of patriotism
and he's like
I'm here because
my country needs me
and it also needs you
and he's like
great let's go.
Cool.
Yeah this works.
I'm on board.
This is a thing that will work.
You don't have to apologize
to me at all.
Yeah.
I mean I guess you have to be
like patriotic
to work for MI6
given the salaries
you know?
Like
if anyone wants to
thank you.
Ah the heckler.
Fully forgot that
Toshiba was sponsoring
British intelligence
that's how weak of a joke
it is.
Oh the way that he escapes
from the thing
by the way
is he dives down
a rubber chute
just loves
he loves chutes.
He's a big chutes guy.
My next note is
wow cars are so cool
I love
Yeah.
They bring
they go
hey remember the
one of one
V16 Rolls Royce
we got for this?
That's cool right?
It's still in the movie.
You know what's annoying
is speed cameras.
So they do a bit
where they set off
a speed camera in it
because he's going so fast
and then you see
a tracking shot of him
setting off like
50 different speed cameras
in like a second
because of how fast it is
and it's like
Yeah.
To get the car
out of the lock up
he like uses a laser
out the front of it
and it shoots out of
the fucking Rolls Royce
like crest sigil
in the front
Yeah it's just fucking
spirit of victory
or whatever.
Like cool man
yeah.
Nice.
I apologise if this is libel
but
Am I right in thinking
that Rowan Atkinson
does in fact
have real speeding tickets?
In which case
these jokes
just come across
as really petty.
Really petty yeah.
I don't know
if we can say
but I think we can say
that someone
in a position
like Rowan Atkinson
could plausibly
be imagined
as part of
a comedic performance
to have had
speeding tickets
and that that
in no way
reflects the real
Rowan Atkinson
I might be
misremembering that
but I seem to remember
that he did
I apologise.
He's probably got
speeding tickets.
Yeah he probably
fucking
Yeah he probably
definitely does
He definitely has
speeding tickets
I don't know
Yeah yeah yeah
My name is Devin
and I believe
that Rowan Atkinson
has speeding tickets.
Just
Just
inflating the lie
to a level
that we cannot
possibly sustain it
and it becomes
increasingly clear
that what we've done
is confused
Rowan Atkinson
with Matthew Broderick.
And Rowan Atkinson
if you don't
but you want
to come down here
if you leave now
you could get
a speeding ticket
by the time you get here.
Some of you
some of you
don't know
about Matthew Broderick
Google it
after the show.
The voice of Simba?
The voice of Simba
yeah
the voice of
driving away
from a fatal accident
as well.
Well that was
the plot
of The Lion King
yes.
Oh yeah.
In many ways
Wildebeest
are the cars
of the Serengeti
so I guess
that doesn't make
a lot of sense.
So
they have to
infiltrate
the fucking
Swiss bunker
right?
Oh yeah.
And this is
this is really funny
because I kind of
get getting
too into
playing a secret agent
right?
As a kind of
60 something
comic actor
and being like
oh this is cool
I'll just make them
do this for real.
But he gets
into it so much
they kind of
make him
Captain Price.
Yeah.
Like they're
infiltrating
the situation
in the like
SAS gear
he's like
right
we're gonna
fuck in
it's like
he does
should have
done one of
the fruit pass doors
before I did
the Captain Price voice
something for tomorrow.
They accidentally
he sets off
an alarm beacon
by mistake
and then they have
to do the
fake prisoner routine
and I do love
it at this point
Daniel Kalu
just gets to
beat the shit
out of him.
Yeah that's good.
It's really funny
that he just like
punches him
and he's like
oh I can see
why people like this
and then just
beats the shit
out of Rowan Atkinson
and like
takes him prisoner.
Yeah.
I like the bit
where he like
gets too excited
about it
and he's like
oh I've got
what have I
shot you?
And you see
Charlie like
oh.
Carrying it too far.
He does
he fucking shoots him
and so then he's
in a fucking
body bag.
Yeah yeah.
I do also want to
I do want to say
before when they
get detected
English says
Dear God
let me not die
at the hands
of the Swiss.
Dear God
let me not die
at the hands
of the Swiss
which
is one of these
bizarre like
top gear
like joke
bigotries
that is still
like acceptable
like not to
defend the honour
of Swiss people
the most racist
people in the world
but like
genuinely though
they teach their
children to hate
to do the like
oh this is a funny
comic thing to do
be like
oh god
the fucking Swiss
it's like
you don't know
anything about
the Swiss
man
like
fucking
it's just a thing
that you do
that you think
is funny
and isn't
you know
also
Dear God
let me not die
at the hands
of the Swiss
is a sentence
that was last
said
in 1513
at the Battle
of Navarra
so like
don't even
It's a shame
what happened
to the Battle
of Navarra
they used to be
quite left wing
but just
a lot of it's
gone really weird
I don't know
what the fuck
he's talking
about nowadays
I like Savoyard
media personally
couple of Swiss
Swiss military
history fans
in tonight
he does like
he does one of
his like
fucking
oh I learned
this from the
Ronin Tangerine
Sellers of Burma
bits
where he like
fuck it
but it like
it doesn't work
if it's not
did you have the dome
that's astonishing
it doesn't work
if it's not
buff
it's like
he's just like
pulling rank
on a younger agent
and he is wrong
and it's not
the same joke
it's just
a worse one
it's true
Daniel Kalia
pretends to kill him
and then they put him
because the only way
up to the fortress
is by cable car
right
so they put him
in a body bag
and then take him
up in the cable
and I'm like
why
yeah put him
in a fridge
put him in a
fucking skip
what are you
going to do
with him up there
you're really
going to have to
bring him
back down again
right
they don't have
like a fucking
corpse fridge
at the top
of Le Bastion
no bring it down
I'm really enjoying
the idea of
like a yellow skip
in the driveway
of like a fucking
evil bunker
someone else's skip
they're just like
oh for fuck
it's like
yeah we're having
the driveway resurface
getting crazy
paving put in
post on next
always like
stop putting corpses
in my fucking skip
watching that skip
like a hawk
so they let
Daniel Kalia
do some acting
he's really good
is the thing
I don't know if you know
this Daniel Kalia
is a really good actor
the movie figures this out
about an hour
and 15 minutes in
he's been waiting
he's been like
finally I get to do
some fucking scenes
anyway
they figure out
that the plan is
that Agent 1
is going to give
Pegasus
the mind control drug
in her
like little drink
and then she's
going to assassinate
the Chinese premiere
so it's going to
look like she did it
and they're going to
get away with it
right
yes
and then if
Johnny English
bursts in
and then he gets
some more gunpoint
he's like
oh Pegasus
they were going to
drug you
how were you going to do it
were you going to
maybe put it in a cocktail
oh no
he's drunk in it
yeah it's very funny
also I do
I do know that
when he first
enters a room
Pegasus
Gillian Anderson
full force
throws a vase
at him
like instantly
like the full
Naomi Campbell
reflex speed
just like
just like
the slightest
misdeed
just goes
like
I could have said
Cheryl Cole
there's a few people
I could
you know
mostly my note
was just to say
that I need
Gillian Anderson
to full force
throw a vase
at me
or someone who
looks a lot like
Gillian Anderson
in this movie
so they give
Johnny English
the mind control
sissy hypno poppers
yes
and
my man is
dilated to fuck
yeah
every
every sphincter
of that man's body
is dilated
to its maximum
permissible diameter
and again
we get this weird
like school
class
some of the weird ones
like stomach
yeah
you need a lot
of those sphincters
tight
yeah
most of them
yeah
just in general
yeah
that's its purpose
yeah
you want those
sphincters to be tight
yeah
I think most of what
internal medicine
as a field is
is about knowing
which sphincters
should be lucid
yes
yes
my man's
gallbladder
is getting flooded
it's just a ring
of muscle folks
so technically
your irises
are a sphincter
you can take that home
it's just fun
watching the audience
to see which of you
have had medical training
you can really loosen
those by doing
too many poppers
so
they send him
into the meeting
with the Chinese
premier
and he's being
controlled through
an earpiece
yeah
prior to this
he has to have
gone joker mode
right
because the way
the drug works
is
well agent one
reveals himself
to be evil
and he's like
the drug has a
manic phase
in which
Rowan Atkinson
does some
physical comedy
and then it has
a Rowan Atkinson
get sissy hypno
to do whatever
I want phase
and then crucially
the next phase
is Rowan Atkinson
fucking dies phase
yeah
15 minutes
yeah
15 minute window
if you do whatever
I say and then
you die
right
yeah
the Chinese
premier says
something here
and my note
says so racist
dog
because the
translator says
China regards
Britain as
completely honorable
and I'm like
I wouldn't
fuck me
dog
there were some
things we did
yeah
like quite
dishonorable
things to
China
first of all
if they do
they're fucking
naive
secondly we're
still on this
like Confucian
honor stereotype
shit
I'm like
for fuck's sake
dog
British prime
minister entering
dialogue with
Chinese premier
be like
we regard you
as completely
honorable
Chinese premier
sup
totally normal
guy
you know
like even the
bond things
where it's like
he goes to the
back of Uzbekistan
and the guy's
like I recognize
you from Oxbridge
where we both
went
it's like less
racist than
this
but so
they give him
a secret gun
in
concealed in
in some
lipstick
yeah because
they planned
for it to be
Gillian Anderson
and so they
have to do a
little cross
dressing
for it to be
funny
so they make
him put on
the lipstick
and then pull
the gun
on the Chinese
premier
however
due to
his monastic
jelking
regimen
the fucking
the fucking
sentences
this job
makes you
say
yeah
due to his
monastic
jelking
regimen
Johnny English
has a purity
of spirit
and a strength
of will
that enables
him to
resist
these impulses
through the
means of
more fucking
physical comedy
yes
like fucking
it's a guy
windmilling his
arms around
it's like
do you remember
the Orson
Wells quote
about Woody
Allen
right
yes
yeah
no
every single
part of this
the fucking
the Chaplin
disease
right
of wanting
to be loved
so badly
that you
project your
insecurities
onto screen
everything you
do is a
kind of
cry for
attention
everything he
does on screen
is therapeutic
and it fucking
is
it works on a
podcast
sucks in a
movie
I was gonna say
I know a couple
of YouTubers
like that
do you want to
name them
nope
okay
okay cool
little practice
point here
by the way
no I do
not
they're shooting
a lot of
Tucker
right
true
now something
that you
might notice
about Tucker
is that he
isn't white
however
they don't
know how to
shoot light
or grade
for non-white
skin
at all
like the
lighting in
this scene
is clearly
done with
the majority
white cast
so like you
see all of
their features
they pop
beautifully
it's really
harsh white
light
and they've
bumped the
contrast up
and the effect
of that is
that you
can't fucking
see Daniel
Kaluuya
like it's
just it's
badly made
and it's
fucking racist
that no one
on the fucking
staff knows
how to shoot
people who
aren't white
racist
color grading
it's a real
thing
racist movie
you meant
shoot in terms
of like film
cameras
yeah yeah
yeah
okay good
just important
to clarify
that one
so Daniel
Kaluuya
hacks the
earpiece
so agent
one says
over the
like public
address
I'm evil
yeah that's
it
and also
they jam
the fucking
connection
so Johnny
English
like just
collapses
at this point
they call in
some Swiss
paramedics
and this is
a weird piece
of world
building right
because like
the whole
aesthetic is
like evil
James Bond
bunker
and we've
left the
kind of
even the
comedy of
Johnny
English
one behind
so these
paramedics
are wearing
like reflective
black
and it's
just a kind
of goth
ambulance
crew
which
yeah
first of all
looks sick
as fuck
but second
of all
is just like
that's an
odd thing
to exist
within the
context of
this movie
to be like
someone's
like no
there's
there would
be too
much
color
if we
had like
a kind
of like
fluorescent
green
instead
we have
to have
like you
know
the hot
topic
paramedics
that's
right
I love
the idea
of a
goth
ambulance
who like
run around
giving vampires
blood
transfusions
draculate's
ex-girlfriend
too
I want
to be a
goth paramedic
when I grow
up
you've got
the outfit
for it
thank you
yeah
just rolls
up
revives you
the die
of blunt
force
trauma
with these
swinging
over you
yeah
so
he gets
revived
by
Rosamund
Pike
kissing
him
he does
a bit
where he
like
ekes it
out
and he's
like
I'm
almost
better
so she
has to
kiss him
some more
and then
when he
gets better
he says
thank you
and she
says
I was
passing
which
I'll say
I mean
you were
until you
said it
she just
she hits
one of
these
and she
goes
like
I
was
passing
also
they do
a joke
that's
written
for
boff
where
he's
like
disappointed
that
Tucker
won't
kiss
him
which
within
the
thing
is
kind
of
a
bit
like
child
abuse
like
yeah
because
Tucker's
written
to be
like
19
and the
work
experience
kid
and he
kind of
does
like
where's
my kiss
on him
which is
yeah that's
like direct
it's your direct
subordinate
you shouldn't kiss
people who work
for you
problematic age gap
apart from
anything else
anyway at this
point the movie
decides
fuck it
he's good
at being
a spy
and so
Rowan
Atkinson
base jumps
off a mountain
and ramps
a snowmobile
onto a
cable
this
motherfucker
within the
same movie
parachutes
onto a
snowmobile
and can't
put on a
pair of
trousers
it just
it doesn't
work
you have
to be
consistent
in it
one thing
I do
like
the
parachute
opens
and it's
for
Toshiba
we spy
for you
thing
funny
funny
however
my next
note
is
film
literally
still
going
yes
they have
a fight
in the
cable car
and agent
one tries
to kick
him in
the balls
thanks to
his monastic
regimen
of jelking
he has
unlocked
a strength
of will
that allows
him
not to
perceive
pain
from
cock
and
ball
torture
would hate
for this
to happen
to me
and so
there's
actually
there's
some
gender
here
because
he
kicks
him
in the
nuts
three
times
and then
goes
what's
wrong
with
you
yeah
it's
possibly
like
a
gendered
reading
of this
anyway
then
English
calls him
a five
star
turd
which
doesn't
even
make
sense
and then
kicks
him
in the
nuts
incapacitating
him
and then
kills
him
well
sort
of
he
falls
out
of
the
cable
car
it's
still
a
little
bit
more
film
yeah
he
falls
out
of
the
cable
car
because
he's
both
competent
and not
right
and then
you have
to hand
it to
them
like
in this
movie
they
really
do
fucking
kill
James
Bond
because
oh wow
he
incredible
thank you
to the
Fremen
for coming
out
tonight
no I'm
not doing
any
thank you
so yeah
he
blows up
Jimmy
McNulty's
cable car
with a
fucking
RPG
sick
shoots
that out
of his
umbrella
he doesn't
know he's
doing it
he thinks
it's the
bulletproof
umbrella
but it's
the one
that actually
shoots a
missile
when you
close it
odd
but sure
whatever
and we
do have
to hand
it to him
he does
kill
James
Bond
he
accomplishes
the mission
of our
podcast
right
he takes
out
agent 1
no problem
he's killed
so many
fucking
agents
over the course
of these
two movies
actually
canonically
all of them
that's true
he's killed
more British
agents than
Kim Philby
they made
him king
King Philby
I'm not gonna
do this
but
so on the
way out
he calls
Daniel
Kaluuya
a clever
boy
I don't
have a drop
of it
but
real bad
don't do
that
so
do you
remember
the queen
still going
her majesty
queen
Elizabeth
the second
buried
with like
10,000
corgis
to serve
her in
the afterlife
when this
came out
she was still
alive
and people
still
like knew
or cared
who she
was
people still
like vaguely
respected
the monarchy
it's true
yeah that's
wild
like it's
so weird
to see
like
this flashback
to a time
when people
gave a shit
about the
monarchy
and it's
like oh
that's the
top bit
of England
and now
it's just
like oh
that guy's
brother's
a pedophile
yeah
allegedly
where the
fuck is
the king
by the way
I feel like
there have been
riots up and
down the country
for like weeks
now and the
king hasn't said
a fucking thing
well he's been
trying to text
but the fingers
he's dead
obviously
he's dead
the king
that's a good
point
and he's got
speeding tickets
as well
there is like
there is
instability
in the realm
where is
the king
the health
of the realm
is the health
of the fucking
monarch
he's gone
he's dead
Henry
Bolingbroke
is massing
a fucking
army with
the earl
of Northumberland
like where
are you at
Henry
if you're
you can be
here
by tomorrow
bunch of
coax up football
fans being like
Henry Henry Henry
Bolingbroke
they knight him
they knight him
again
yeah
because he used
to be king
but and then
he was a knight
and then he lost
that and I was
a knight again
yeah
right
same ending
as the first one
yeah except one
thing about the
queen right
is that she's
an old woman
with grey hair
yep
oh
one thing I don't
remember the queen
being was
Chinese
getting a knighthood
and you're like
it's fine I just
didn't expect it
to be Chinese
I'll accept
a Chinese knighthood
and so he
I wouldn't accept
a British one
oh yeah
they went to a lot
of trouble
not to have those
anymore
yeah
that's reasonable
so he
he goes
Liz trust mode
and he tries
to take out
the queen
he
tackles
the queen
starts beating
her up with a
fucking like
plate or whatever
it's a crisis
yeah
mm-hmm
ah heckler
I don't know
what you said
um
no
gotta get a
spotlight on
whoever that
was
yeah can we
just like
we'll start
booing
yeah
so yeah
he like
fucking gets
the queen
in a headlock
and the movie
ends with the
reaction shot
of him
realising
that he has
got the queen
in a headlock
and it's like
yeah cause they
bring in the
actual woman
like it's a
bunch of guards
come into the
room holding
the actual woman
and he goes
oh it's the
queen
oh fuck
cut
Dan has a
mid-credit scene
where he does
the hall of the
mountain king
shit and some
vegetables
I don't know
what the fuck
this was about
you
we talked about
this like
in the group
chat you were
like what the
fuck was that
mid-credit scene
and I absolutely
had not seen
the mid-credit scene
no
the second
the first like
credit popped up
I'm slamming the
big like red
emergency stop
button that I've
had plumbed
into the telly
like like the
wood class at
school machines
like no
have like a
sore stop for
the tv that
just detonates
the led
yeah yeah yeah
I'm done
you go through
so many tvs
it's why we're
not profitable
yeah no
really honestly
I can't wait
for you to
defect so we
can get back
to a normal
tv budget
no
I mean the
tv budget
bought all
these you know
speaking of
budgets though
I can reveal
I can reveal
some fun things
about the budget
of this movie
so it had a
budget of
40 million
fuck me
it made 160
million dollars
it made about
9 million in
the US which
is not good
this is one of
the least ethical
ways to make
120 million
dollars and there
are a lot of
unethical ways to
make 120 million
dollars
it's not even
enough to
assassinate the
premier of china
there's approximately
no ethical ways
to make 120
million dollars
if there are
I'm gonna find
them
we'll see
we'll see
patreon.com
slash kill
james bond
120 million
dollars here
wait will we
assassinate the
premier of china
I'm not gonna
commit us to
that
one of us
maybe who can
then defect
to avoid
suspicion
I'll do it
yeah yeah
sure
perfect
so it made
9 million
in the US
and then it
made 151
million on the
international
market which
includes Britain
so people
love Mr. Bean
and they love
Mr. Bean
movies
they do
so 33
million in
the UK
14 million
in Germany
and then
and this is
very funny
13 million
in Argentina
wow
which I thought
was an interesting
fact
what are you guys
doing
because they love
Royne Atkinson
in Germany
and like
seriously
it's like
just under
and then everything
else is like
500,000 in Singapore
500,000 in like
Peru or whatever
it's just like
Germany and Argentina
like just one
behind the other
that's crazy
Mr. Bean
is Sir Cormish
and it also
made me imagine
Michael Fassbender
as Magneto
going to Argentina
to hunt down
Mr. Bean
it's the reverse
right
you look at
all the places
where
Johnny English
Reborn
was streamed
in Argentina
and that's
your kind of
like you know
signifying the
number three
with this
rather than
like this
right
that's how
you know
whether or not
someone's a
Nazi
right
but we don't
I mean
what did we learn
from this movie
first of all
Tucker doesn't get a
knighthood by the way
he's just
he's gone
yeah Tucker just
leaves the film
he's not getting
shit
he's not even
getting like a CMG
like
he's out of here
he's not even in
the third one
no
they kill him
like off screen
or something
Boff takes him out
damn shame
damn shame
tell you what
Boff is a man
without honour
or humanity
like
it's rough
it's more like
Messmer the Impaler
in a way
this movie
what does it say
about masculinity
what does it say
about Englishness
God it says
quite a lot
about
he says much more
about masculinity
in this one
because like
he's much more
of a typical
James Bond figure
in this one
even down to
the making
misogynistic jokes
which he resisted
doing for the most part
in the first one
yeah
it's the boomer
particles have
intensified
to the point
that we may
no longer be able
to contain them
buy your ticket
to night three
it gets worse
it does
it really does
but in this one
it's just like
oh yeah
of course
this guy
would like
drive a big
fuck off Rolls Royce
and of course
speeding cameras
are annoying
and call centres
are annoying
and like
the government
is privatising
everything
we'll get to
more government
stuff in three
but like
it's just
but hidden in
all of that
as well
it's just like
this David Cameron
guy seems nice
yeah
he seems basically
smart and chill
he says stuff
like rapprochement
which is like
he went to Eton
for God's sake
yeah
like it's a movie
that falls for
its own bullshit
it like identifies
hey wait a second
you can't just say
that this guy's cool
because he went to Eden
and then goes
David Cameron
he seems like
he's on the ball
with the stuff
you know
there's just like
a little bit of reaction
creeping in him
there's that conservatism
at the core
of Britishness
starts to come in
in this movie
and it gets
much much worse
tomorrow night
and it's just
it's just alarmingly
racist against
like Asians
specifically
like Chinese people
like just sort of
a pan-Asian
racist noise
hell it doesn't do
any favours
for Mozambique
no that's true
or the Swiss
I guess
if we're going
down the list
or all the fucking
English people
who aren't white
like Daniel Kaluuya
is treated like
fucking shit
in this movie
by Johnny English
like it's so painful
to watch
yeah and he has to
like kind of
comically shrug it off
because it's a comedy
and it's like
okay
I genuinely thought
there was going to be
a moment where he goes
to him in his flat
and he's like
your country needs you
and I wanted
Daniel Kaluuya
to have a moment
to be like
oh fucking does it
does it
yeah it could have
fooled me
yeah like he's a
black kid living
in a really small flat
under fucking
David Cameron's
conservative government
I thought they were
going to make
a big deal out of it
like that would have
been a really
interesting moment
instead of says
like yeah go on then
but
we don't have to be
subjective about
these things
because
we have a science
based system
it's called
the scum system
it stands for
smarm
cultural insensitivity
unprovoked violence
and misogyny
so
on a scale of
zero to seven
how
scum
scum
scum
scum
scum
scum
scum
scum
scum
I almost forgot
about the scum
thing
yeah
okay
um
that doesn't
get easier
hmm
I don't like
that you can
use them
to chant
scum
at me
like that
but
I'm trying
my best
over here
alright okay
how smarmy
is this movie
bear in mind
that we gave
the last one
a seven
hmm
it kind of
weirdly
it seems
slightly less
now that he's
like
more competent
it's less
because they
get more
serious
it's true
less
there are a few
smarmy lines
but it's still
extremely pleased
with itself
all that stuff
of like walking
around the
obstacles
and like oh
he's so wise
because he's
like got the
old boomer
stuff
he's better
than the
young agent
who like
can't take
a hit
and like oh
I'm so wise
but I don't
like put up
with call
centers and
speed cameras
and shit
it's like oh
fuck
oh
I think
I think the
parkour
sequence
gave like
made me want
to give it
a six
and like all
the Rolls Royce
shit too
lasers its way
out of the
garage
yeah
no
grim
fawning shot
of the front
of the Rolls Royce
oh
what if you
could get a
Rolls Royce
you can't
none of you
can get a
fucking
I'm not
getting a
Rolls Royce
no one's
getting a
fucking
Rolls Royce
only this
guy's getting
a Rolls Royce
and he wants
to like rub
your face
in it
yeah
it sucks
they're not
even that nice
I'd rather
have an Aston
if any of you
are buying
to defect
right
do you have
to do like
an application
form
or
we can just
yeah
we'll talk
perfect
it's gotta be
a seven
seven
fair enough
sure
un
wait no
cultural
insensitivity
the sum
system
the sum
system
yeah
I can probably
play all of
these at once
as
as
god
god
is
my
witness
I
didn't
know
that
would
work
together
as
well
as
it
did
pretty
good
I feel
like it's
worse
than last
night
it definitely
is
it's the most
racist one
well because the first one was like pure
pure like
oh god
admission
isn't it
no what's the other one
admission
yeah
so good
it omitted the fuck out of shit
yeah
this one is actively mean to like half the planet
I feel like it's we've got to go into the punitive zone
for like calling
calling Daniel Kaluuya boy
on come
like someone should have called that
and that shit you brought up dev about the fucking lighting as well
you're so right like
it's just
yeah like not even just like within the actual script of the movie
but within the technical creation of the movie they were racist towards Daniel Kaluuya
yeah
eight
nine
I'll do an
I'll do an eight
I think
cool
which puts it on par with I think we live and let die
let's
let's give us some room to go up
un
unprovoked violence
though
I think
this
this
I mean
what does
he beat
again low
yeah he blows up James Bond but he was shooting at him
that's provoked
yeah he beats up some goons but they were attacking him
he does do
he does
we
the invisibilisation
of ableism
in our discourses
you are fucking speaking
I completely forgot that he pulls a gun on like disabled civilians
for no reason
that
that very beautiful and intelligent woman in the front row who I've never met before
is very correct
you should try meising her I've been dating her for a while she's lovely
um
three
then
four
I don't know how do we
how do we
she's nice
like
what
she's nice
I've met her
yeah
she's a good lass
um
I feel like
I don't know is there anything else other than the pulling a gun on disabled people
I mean I mean he does beat the shit out of the
what
you're not allowed to fucking interrupt me
I half tolerate it from them
the mum thing is accidental we don't count those
like it's not
yeah that's not the movie isn't asking us to endorse that violence as like funny or ethical
right
yeah
so
three
three yeah
three
it's always the low one unless it isn't and then it's usually like
danger diabolic was like seven because of all the murders he did
misogyny
misogyny
don't woo
don't woo that
I
it's
yeah I thought the
the cheer line
have that motherfucker flenced
spotlight right
some of you are gonna laugh when you google flensing
having the
having the kids interrupt Em's briefings
oh it fucking sucks
and the whole like
new broom sexism thing
like in golden eye
if you take that as a bellwether of british culture
it sucked then
to do it in 2011 to be like
oh we're woke and soy now
because there's women in charge
and we're in touch with our feelings
it's fucking terrible
like
dialogue is a weapon of choice
dialogue is our weapon
at the very least that's
that puts it up in the realm of like five
right
yeah I think so too
and also the fact that Rosamund Pike just like
obviously falls in love with him
hmm
doesn't really do anything else
like what
what is the rest of her character
revived by a kiss
does she have any hopes dreams
that we know of
um
death
could we call that
leakage
it's about
it's about it
yeah
does she have any
just
just purely there
to be like
fall in love with Johnny English
at the end
six
death
death
death
all right
death
six and an optional death penalty
anything above five is death penalty
as far as I'm concerned
are we establishing that as a zone then
sure
okay
that gives us a total score of
24
it is
pretty bad
they're getting worse
they're getting worse
it's plausible
I think
I'm not sure if this is going to be like a sort of a hump in the curve
it's going to go straight down
you know
like I don't know
I mean although
Johnny English faring better than Austin Powers
it must be said
that's
yeah
now I can see that
yeah that's
that's plausible to me
but worse than Charlie's Angels
Charlie's Angels
Full Throttle was a 15
it was practically perfect
yeah
in hindsight
that movie was great
don't
go back and look
honestly
don't remember a fucking thing about that movie
also pretty racist against Asians
anyway
we all have like awards as well
we do
we mentioned Cronstein earlier on
who the fuck was that to
to the guy who jumps off the burning boat
to jump onto a platform
to fight Johnny English
god yes
hell yes
that is going above and beyond
he could have just swum away
that probably would have been clever actually
I feel like I also want to give
another Cronstein Rosette
to the goon who stole the stewardess's clothes
yes
because that's like a hell of a gambit
certainly
that is going above and beyond
yeah transitioning for the bit
I mean
yeah
two Cronsteins
if the bit's good enough
I kind of want to give Daniel Kaluuya
a goodnight cross
absolutely
I feel like
what else did we invent
the goodnight cross
yeah exactly
for going above and beyond
were there any from yesterday
we forgot to
I don't remember that movie
I don't
remember a single fucking thing I'm afraid
don't worry about it
I hit myself on the head
with a big podcasting hammer
yeah
vote now on your phones
I don't care
um
okay
I did that specifically
because you said to me
there was one
you wanted to give it to
and I don't remember now
okay
what a tangled web
to be fair
you told me who it was
and I don't remember either
yeah exactly
all right
speaking of Cronstein Rosettes
and Goodnight Crosses
after this
there will be a bar
open until 10
which gives you
40 minutes of drinking time
and
we will be
we will be selling
posters
this poster
which fucks
we will be signing
posters
we will be selling
little pin badges
of the Cronstein Rosette
and Goodnight Cross

but we'll try
tough
tough to do
if you want to just hang out
come take a picture with us

that was pretty good
I don't know
the two guys yesterday

magnificent
we signed

I can't stress this enough
you guys are the best
like genuinely
