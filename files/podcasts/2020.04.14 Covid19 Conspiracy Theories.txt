I assume that as a listener of our show, you might often perk up at buzzwords like panic and hysteria
that can follow with intelligent debunking of mass illusions, or, on the contrary,
can attempt to downplay serious events in order to promote conspiracy theories that better represent the speaker's political point of view.
When I see conservative outlets describe the coronavirus pandemic as a hysteria or mass panic,
I get a little twinge in my gut because that language is my language too.
In fact, for full transparency, I wondered about COVID-19 seriously in the beginning
and wondered if the U.S. was simply freaking out over the newest Ebola, the newest mad cow,
the newest SARS, the newest swine or bird flu, a risk so far overblown that it casts a skeptical shadow across what we're currently experiencing.
But skepticism is a two-way street, and we need to be just as skeptical of those calling something a hysteria
as we should be about those who've played into what we now know to be mass panics and nothing more.
I want you to be just as skeptical of me, though I do try my very, very best to find the facts.
But we're all fallible, and my initial reaction to the coronavirus was shaded by my own preconceived notions from creating this show,
as well, I guess, as a hope that this was all, indeed, a hysteria.
Of course, we've now unfortunately seen that this is not the case.
Luckily, I didn't fall prey to any conspiracy theories about the coronavirus,
as I honestly might have in my less skeptical days, to put it mildly.
But, of course, they still fascinate and terrify me,
and they still say the same old stuff that they always have,
but now with a new and dramatic kind of fodder.
I mean, shit, you guys, we've never seen or experienced anything like what is happening now.
And even two months ago, we could have never predicted the new state of the world,
the state of our own individual lives.
As the economy tanks, jobs are lost, all non-essential businesses close,
schools out for the summer and beyond,
and we're all barred from seeing our loved ones,
or at least barred from being less than six feet away from them.
Of course, I don't need to debunk conspiracy theories for you guys.
I know you're more than capable of that yourselves.
But I also know that you're likely as interested as I am
to hear the bizarre, funny, and certainly dangerous stories
that are being peddled as fact across social media and the news,
most prominently that the virus was created in a Chinese lab,
released either as a biological weapon or a mistake,
with an apparent 29% of Americans believing this to be true.
Of course, China believes the same thing about us.
In fact, countries all over the world are accusing each other
of being the true source of the mysterious illness,
and all those accusations have a lot in common with their political interests.
But I thought we'd take a look at some of the other theories
that are also taking hold,
and just so you know, there are plenty more than this.
But these are the ones I thought would interest you the most today.
In good form, let's start with Goop,
Gwyneth Paltrow's outrageously successful lifestyle company
that peddles in phony alternative healing,
as we covered in our episode called Quackery.
Blogger Kelly Brogan, MD,
who calls herself a holistic psychiatrist,
whatever that is,
came out recently to say that,
drumroll please,
she does, quote,
not believe in germ-based contagion,
saying that this type of medicine is, quote,
not a conceptual framework that I operate within.
She then goes on to sympathize with those microbes
that have been unfairly, quote,
villainized and discriminated against by false science
because, quote,
it's not possible to prove that any given pathogen has induced death.
So, what's with all the deaths and sickness,
you might ask, Dr. Kelly Brogan, MD?
She claims that the virus is, quote,
likely being accelerated by the fear itself.
Luckily, her posts have been removed from social media
because, quote,
censorship is real and underway.
What a purification process this is,
she says on the video with a sly smile.
She encourages her fans to think for themselves and, quote,
try on other narratives with that age-old idea
that we all create our own realities.
But that's not all.
She goes on to wonder if the U.S. government
is going to, quote,
link our passports with our vaccination records
in order to aid, end quote,
totalitarian governmental control,
not unlike the divide and conquer dehumanization agendas
that preceded the Holocaust.
Real nice, Kelly.
Now, let's move on to evil nerd Bill Gates.
An article from the website Humans Are Free
made a claim in the early stages of COVID-19
that the virus was patented in 2018
by the Purbright Institute out of Surrey, England,
financed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
Fast forward to something called Event 201.
An account called at Freedom Faction
wrote a post stating that, quote,
the participants of Event 201,
invited there by the rich and powerful elites
that rule the world,
sat and war-gamed how an outbreak
of COVID-19 coronavirus might go.
Looks like the meeting was a success
because just one month to the day later,
the first case of COVID-19 was reported in China.
And well, you know the rest.
At Freedom Faction goes on, quote,
the patent page for coronavirus
explains that it may be used as a vaccine
for treating and or preventing a disease
such as infectious bronchitis in a subject,
suggesting that this is just another weaponized
viral strain designed to sell more useless,
deadly vaccines,
while at the same time killing off a few thousand
or perhaps a few million people.
The Purbright Institute is a real place
which studies animal viruses
as well as their potential transfer to humans.
It's true that they do have a patent
for a coronavirus,
but for a strain that mainly affects chickens,
one that has almost absolutely nothing
to do with COVID-19,
our specific strain.
And Event 201 was a real event,
hosted in October by the Johns Hopkins Center
for Health Security in partnership with
and hosted by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
and the World Economic Forum.
But as you might imagine,
it's far less nefarious than Freedom Faction
would lead us to believe.
Featuring medical professionals,
policy experts,
and business analysts,
the event focused on how each of these sectors
would respond in the case of a pandemic,
and they used a simulation
to encourage international cooperation
to face what they consider
to be a rising threat around the world.
This is nothing new.
The Center for Health Security
has put on three simulations like this
since 2001,
and it's all pretty boring.
But right now,
it's also seeming pretty important.
Getting back to the spiritual,
let's look at Christian-adjacent psychic
Sylvia Brown's book,
End of Days,
which allegedly predicted the coronavirus
in some kind of prophecy.
Kim Kardashian repopularized
the End of Days book
when she tweeted a section
to her 64 million followers,
which was retweeted at least 48,000 times,
not unlike when she tweeted
about the now-debunked Momo suicide game
we covered in a mini-episode last year.
Immediately,
Sylvia Brown's book launched
into Kindle's top 10 e-books,
leading Penguin Random House
to rush End of Days back into print.
This 2008 prophecy of interest reads,
quote,
In around 2020,
a severe pneumonia-like illness
will spread through the globe,
attack in the lungs and bronchial tubes,
and resist in all known treatments.
Almost more baffling than the illness
will be the fact
that it will suddenly vanish
as quickly as it arrived
and attack again 10 years later,
and then disappear completely.
I don't know if that's what she sounds like.
Anyway,
a little creepy, right?
Well,
not really.
The generalness
and weird vernacular
of in around 2020
is the oldest trick
in the psychic book.
Would 2009 count?
2015?
2025?
2030?
The readers are the ones
who get to decide.
In addition,
SARS,
which stands for
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,
was making its rounds
during the writing
of End of Days.
Brown also predicted
an epidemic for 2010,
this one a flesh-eating disease
caused by microscopic mites
hiding in the feathers
of imported exotic birds.
Antibiotics would be no match
for this pandemic,
but luckily doctors
would apparently find that,
quote,
a combination of electrical currents
and extreme heat
would save the day.
Oh,
and to fill out
the full character
of Sylvia Brown,
throughout her career,
she provided
countless parents,
often on TV,
with false information
regarding their missing children,
throwing out
her psychic visions
of whether they were dead
or alive,
where they were,
and who took them.
And of course,
if she wasn't general enough
in her predictions,
she was usually wrong.
Real nice, Sylvia.
Meanwhile,
a prominent fundamentalist preacher
named Perry Stone
recently claimed
that COVID-19
is a satanic attempt
to kill Christian baby boomers
so socialism can replace
capitalism in the United States.
Here's what he had to say,
quote,
It's almost like
the spirit of Almelech
that is trying to attack
our older people.
Let me tell you
why the enemy
wants to get rid
of our older people.
They are the ones
who are established
in the Bible.
They are the ones
who know enough
about the word
not to take the mark
of the beast.
They're out there.
35% of America
is into it,
and they have no respect
for those older people
who have made
this country
great.
Thank you.
Of course,
on top of our dear
satanic panic,
coronavirus conspiracies
would not be complete
without an elite
deep state
Jewish Illuminati cabal.
And of course,
this cabal
is trying to usher in
martial law
to imprison
and then murder
all the great
white patriots
of America.
You know,
the usual story.
Especially coming
from the United States
and Iraq,
memes have been going around
claiming that Israel
as a whole
or George Soros
or the Rothschild family
concocted this outbreak
to further exert
their control
over the world.
Taking it a step
farther than memes,
the FBI reported
that far-right
white supremacist groups
have been encouraging
their infected followers
on social media
and forums
to, quote,
cough on their
local minorities
and to lick items
in the kosher section
of their grocery store.
They're also encouraged
to stoke
growing tensions
between different nations
and races
to induce
what they call
the boogaloo,
which is apparently
their term
for the coming
race war.
As usual,
real nice
far-right.
Speaking of
right-wing conspiracy
theorists,
Alex Jones'
Infowars website
has a video
titled, quote,
Homeland Security
Buying Up
All Available
Emergency Food.
But just take a look
over to the right
sidebar and you can
buy from their
online store
a four-week supply
of food,
with the ad telling
viewers,
others are sold out.
But Trump,
a longtime Alex Jones
fan,
agreed with the
recipient of the
Presidential Medal
of Freedom,
Rush Limbaugh,
that the deep state,
or the Democrats,
had literally
weaponized the
coronavirus to
crash the markets
and, quote,
bring down Trump.
QAnon,
the online
pro-Trump
extremist
right-wing
anonymous faction
claiming to have
inside information
about literally
everything,
is claiming that
coronavirus task force
leader,
Anthony Fauci,
made the novel
virus himself
in 2015
along with
who else
but Hillary Clinton.
Oh, and of course,
no conspiracy
would be complete
without a satanic
pedophile ring
and Fauci has joined
their ranks because,
and yes,
I have no idea
what this means,
he appears in a picture
with Elton John,
meaning that he must
be a part of the
Jewish homosexual
agenda.
In some less horrific
and more fun
conspiracy theories,
we have a few
cartoon prophecies
to share as well.
Apparently,
a 1993 episode
of The Simpsons
about a disease
called the
Osaka flu
predicted the virus
would arrive
in a package
from Japan
with the spreaders
of this legend
changing Kent Brockman's
headline
to coronavirus
and those edited
screenshots
were retweeted
thousands of times,
likely,
or I should say
hopefully,
in good fun.
In addition,
Disney's animated
movie Tangled
apparently knew
about the coronavirus
ahead of time
and in classic
Illuminati style
left some clues
for the masses
to figure out.
Rapunzel is locked
away in a tower
like all of us
right now
in,
that's right,
the kingdom
of Corona.
Of course,
some of these
conspiracy theories
are harmless
and some of them
are downright dangerous
because what they can do
is make us trust
the wrong people.
It's great to be skeptical
about the government
and world health organizations
and really anyone,
but at the end of the day,
are you going to trust
someone called
at Freedom Faction
or are you going to
trust people
who've made it
their life's work
to keep us safe?
At one time,
I may have trusted
the former,
but right now,
I'm just hoping
that the people
we are putting
our trust in
are doing the best
that they can
and I hope that you
as well
are doing the best
that you can.
And only if we stop
villainizing each other
can we really
pull this thing together.
Thanks as always
for listening
and until next time,
take care of yourselves
and have a great week.
