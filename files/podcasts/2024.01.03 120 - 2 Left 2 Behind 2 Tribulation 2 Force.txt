Well, it is. Look at that. Look at I am. I am recording this live from the new year from 2020.
That's right. We're coming to you live from the future.
Yeah, we're all in different places. AJ still is in his home, his sort of usual place.
Yeah. Josh is in an undisclosed location on the upper peninsula of Michigan.
My bunker deep underground. Yeah, I am in the ball.
Oh, I'm in the ball and it's oh, God. Oh, oh, I think it's fun.
Oh, it doesn't plummet. Yeah, no, but it's still it's very if you were in something, AJ, and it started to just move down out of nowhere.
Oh, is the ball fucking you?
Scary.
So many possible worlds, but we got this one.
So many possible worlds, but we got this one.
Welcome to the worst of all possible worlds, the first and only podcast where the ball fucks you.
I'm the worst of all possible, AJ's.
I'm the worst of all possible, Brian.
Why did I ever want to do this?
And I'm the worst of all possible, Josh's.
Yes, we are back at it again in the new year, which it is right now when we're recording this for sure.
And we're here to talk about the next installment in the Left Behind series.
That's right. We're back on our bullshit.
Yeah.
Recapping.
Cameron's got the mad hits.
He does.
The sequel to Left Behind.
Yeah.
Right in front of.
And let me just give me a...
Tribulation Force.
I actually need to literally reach over and pick my book up.
Hold on.
Okay.
Oh, it's so heavy.
It's so heavy.
Oh, there's so many pages in this book.
The audio book is 11 hours long.
Is it really?
That's far longer than it should be.
Because they got Werner Herzog to read it.
We're going to mostly be talking about the movie today.
And if you haven't been following our coverage of the Left Behind series so far, you can feel free to go back and listen to our first episode about the original Left Behind.
You can go back even further and listen to our episode about the movie Thief in the Night.
Basically, we have been for a while now recapping stuff that is to do with the rapture.
This is the idea that Jesus Christ in all of his glory is going to come back down to earth, but not before he fucking yeets his favorite people up into the sky first and then subjects the rest of the world, both the continuing sinners and those who have chosen to be saved, to seven years of absolute torment.
Among those people?
Catholics.
Yes.
Yeah.
It doesn't get a whole lot of attention in the movie because the movie desperately needs to make money, but in the book, it's very staunchly anti-Catholic.
Right.
I was always told in Sunday school that after the rapture, it's too late.
It doesn't matter if you accept Jesus.
You are fucked.
God does not want you anymore.
That was always my understanding as well, actually.
But that doesn't make for a great narrative arc to a story.
You know, theologically, it's fine because all this stuff is really just people kind of feeling something out.
There's nothing going on here.
This series, the Left Behind series, was a genuine cultural phenomenon in 1999, right?
Right.
And a big piece of this was that the year 2000 was coming up.
We, of course, will all remember the Y2K panic and the idea that, like, this might just be it.
The spinoff of the X-Files called Millennium.
Was it approaching?
Yes, actually.
That is kind of what the show is about.
Yeah.
Oh, shit.
But, you know, I think the big twist was that it wasn't the Millennium.
It was the Willennium.
Right, right.
Well, we didn't know that at the time.
No, no.
Who could have predicted?
The only one who knew that was Jada.
And even she strayed from the truth.
Yeah.
Like the Apostle Peter.
I am holding on to my copy of Left Behind Tribulation Force, the continuing drama of
Those Left Behind.
This is a paperback that I procured at the Christian Education Thrift Store for the low,
low price of 50 cents.
What a resale value.
Incredible resale value.
You can see here there's something printed on the cover.
And I think you had mentioned this, Brian, when we did the first Left Behind episode.
Every cover shows you how many copies the series has sold so far.
So this copy of Tribulation Force at the time of printing, and this is a first edition paperback,
says over 1,500,000 sold in series.
Well, and I think that's interesting that they say in series because clearly it was like the
first book, maybe the second book.
Yeah.
But there had to have been diminishing returns at a certain point because there are a lot
of books in the series.
I think 16 books in the series in total.
They're still writing them.
Are they?
What's left?
I think it's looped around to the point where Jerry B. Jenkins is going back to the early
books and re-upping them, essentially.
No way.
Like getting rid of 90s references and making them a little bit more in line.
Not to the same degree as the new movies are.
Sure.
Because the 2022 version of Tribulation Force has thrown in a bunch of stuff about vaccines
that's mostly just confusing.
Oh, hell yeah.
Yeah.
I thought the new Left Behind came out in 2023.
Was there a different-
Was it this year?
Yeah, it was.
Kevin Sorbo.
Was it last year?
We're in the future.
This is 2024.
Yeah.
The year we're in right now.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Brian's in a ball.
Either way, it was.
Yeah.
It's a post-COVID one.
And they decided to throw in a bunch of COVID stuff that doesn't actually line up with what
this book is about at all.
Right.
Because it's all just about Jews.
Jews.
Yeah.
So a lot of interesting stuff in this book, and we will get to it when we get to it.
But because Brian and AJ remain proudly illiterate, I'm the only one who actually read the book.
Yeah, baby.
The three of us, however, did watch the motion picture called Left Behind Tribulation Force.
And that's most of what we're going to be talking about.
The original Tribulation Force movie, which is the sequel to the original Left Behind movie,
and still stars Kirk Cameron as Buck Williams.
Our favorite, just weirdest guy who has ever lived, Kirk Cameron, a man who will not kiss anyone that is not his wife.
And so this rom-com that he finds himself in in this movie is deeply weird because it's just a lot of meaningful hugs.
Like he's in It's an Always Sunny sketch where there's just a sexually charged hug every 15 minutes.
He kisses a cheek.
I was surprised about that.
And not a butt cheek.
That would be cool.
And immediately after they have Rayford Steele, the father of this character that he just kissed,
also kiss her on the same cheek to be like, it's okay, folks.
Don't get too excited.
No, no.
It's a transfer.
It's showing that Rayford and Buck.
Yeah, they do.
I mean, there is a prayer scene in this where I'm like, oh my God, yes.
Oh boy.
I'm glad you picked up on that too.
Wait a second.
Wait a second.
Oh no.
No.
No.
Rayford?
Oh no.
Buck?
Uh huh.
Yeah.
Chloe?
Yeah.
Chloe?
What is this?
What is this?
It's the three main characters.
It's the four main characters of Tribulation Force.
Oh, okay.
The fourth one is like.
The fourth one, by the way, his name is Bruce.
Wait a second.
Yeah, wait.
Hold on.
Bruce?
Yeah.
Buck?
Hmm.
Ben Judah?
What is this?
I forgot.
What is this?
What is this?
What is this?
You know, being in the future of CoinTrack.
What is this?
You know, this is also a thing, listeners, you should know that every year right before
the new year turns, Brian, Josh, and I all hit each other in the head with giant mallets.
Yeah.
So we can forget everything that happened in the year before.
That is a premier ball activity.
They all come to the ball and we hit each other with ball hammers.
And that was the thing about last year.
I'm sure you remember last year when I told everybody, yeah, I got concussed skiing.
That wasn't true.
It was actually just lingering impacts from the hammers, from the mallets.
We have our names on them.
They're all color coded.
Every year we get each other bigger mallets.
It's really it's a lovely tradition.
Wait a second.
Wait.
Big mallets.
The ball.
A ski trip.
Yeah.
What is this?
What is this?
What is this?
What is this?
I'm asking you.
So here's so here's the thing.
This this movie is produced by Cloud 10 Productions, which is more than Cloud 9.
I made that joke last year.
Doesn't it?
Doesn't it always feel like this time it really hit me that like it's got like an hour amps
go up to 11 vibe.
Yeah.
Yeah.
When when these opening credits came up, I was on Cloud 10.
I was like, we are so fucking back.
We are so fucking back.
It's it's the fact that it's like a missing persons board, but it's only kind of halfway
filled out, which is what this whole movie feels like.
It's like they're half filled at best.
Every single one is maybe half done, which it like in terms of production design, it feels
like all of these things were just like, yeah, good enough.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, exactly.
The like half filled wall of missing people is, I think, emblematic of this film overall.
This film somehow feels even lower budget and lower effort than the original Kirk Cameron
left behind, which is really saying something.
It's like when you watch the Atlas Shrugged sequels.
It's like clear that they just have a smaller and smaller budget.
Which Brian does every Christmas.
He sits down with his family and goes through the entire Atlas Shrugged quadrology.
How many are there?
Three.
There's just a trilogy.
I thought maybe they split the last part into two more parts.
They couldn't afford to.
It's fair.
So we remember, of course, Buck Williams, our intrepid journalist.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He, of course, is the one who is played by Kirk Cameron.
He works for GNN.
Yes.
The TV news network.
The global news network.
Global.
Global.
And also, you know, this is a guy who's never found a suit that has fit him in his entire
life.
Correct.
He's always just like, no, I want it bigger.
He's so small.
He's just a very small man.
He's a wee little elf boy.
There's nothing wrong with being a short king.
No, absolutely not.
It's just that for some reason, they are completely insistent on, you know, who knows to what extent
this was the creators, the directors, fucking, you know, Kirk Cameron himself, insistent
on trying to make him be like a big, tough guy.
And he's just not.
You must make me large.
I must be large in my suit.
He's wearing David Byrne's suit.
Yeah, I know.
He was just like, stop making sense for the entirety of the costume design for this film.
But yeah, Buck is, you know, delivering one of his famous, I guess, monologues because
he's on this news station.
And he has captured the attention of one Nikolai Karpathia, who we might remember is, in fact,
the Antichrist.
Oh!
But the post-disaster cleanup is not the only issue facing overstrained governments around
the world.
Look at this.
Acts of violence.
Young.
Energetic.
Honest.
What is this?
What is this?
Let's talk about Gordon Curry's performance here.
Tasty.
Tasty!
Who doesn't love some curry?
Go on.
It's very tasty, spicy, but not too spicy.
He is actually probably the most charismatic actor in this film.
He has made a choice to make Nikolai Karpathia Russian for reasons that are very...
Well, he's Romanian.
Oh!
And that is a pitch-perfect Romanian accent if I ever heard one.
The funny thing is, I know we have Romanian listeners, so Romanian listeners, let us know
in the comments or over social media how accurate that Romanian accent is.
I know it's great.
Is that in the books?
Is that accent written into the books?
Well, not the accent, but the fact that he is...
That would be funny.
Yeah.
Right out fanatically.
No, but the fact that he is Romanian is very, very important in the books because of the
fact that so much of the narrative of the books is guided by Tim LaHaye, who will remember
is sort of...
He's not the guy writing this, but he's the guy giving Jerry Jenkins notes on it needs
to be this way.
It's very important to him that the guy be from Romania because then it fulfills the prophecy
that he'll be Roman?
Yeah.
Which is not how this works at all.
Oh my God.
What?
There's also like a communism angle.
If I remember correctly, Nicolai Carpathia has two gay dads.
I think you're right.
And he was...
And he's born from artificial insemination because they're like Marxist fag scholars.
But he like overcame, you know, the constraints of Ceucescu is Romania and it's a mess.
It's a fucking mess.
And this movie kind of casually throws out that he was stabbed as a child, which I guess
is...
I was unclear if that was made up or that was a thing that actually happened to the character.
Right.
Like there's so much in this story in particular that relies on information that you should
just receive earlier.
Right?
You could even receive it in the movie.
You could have Nicolai talking about like, oh yes, when I was a small boy on the ferme and
I got stabbed by the tractor or whatever.
Yeah.
And then you have Ben Judah could just be introduced as a character at some point before the third
act of the film.
Right.
Yeah.
But no, these are all things that do happen in the book.
The problem is that the book is unbelievably fucking boring, like even more boring than
the movie.
Yeah.
Because it's so up its ass with these like specific detail things that are not particularly
salient to the plot at all.
Yeah.
This is like if Marshall Younger wrote a book.
Carpathia's plan is to bring the whole world under one government.
This will be under the governing auspices of the United Nations, which is he is going
to rename the global community because he is global homo.
Global citizen.
That's right.
One currency, baby.
And that currency is pops coin.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Every currency has collapsed.
He's in this UN meeting with five people.
Yep.
Broadcast to the world of 12 people.
Which again, that's an interesting choice, right?
If like half the UN got fucking yeeted in the rapture.
Right, right, right.
That seems like a choice.
But there's just enough people where you're like, oh, they couldn't fill out the extras
for the day.
They just could not afford the whole room.
This is why Dallas Jenkins, Jerry's son, has figured out how to like populate his TV show
about Jesus with followers of Christ by just getting unpaid extras.
Right.
Oh, sure.
How do we find Carpathia as an antagonist?
Because we'll remember at the end of the first Left Behind movie, he shoots that guy in the
face or whatever.
And so he's evil.
But like, yeah.
Do we actually buy him?
I mean, I think what's interesting is that he's incredibly stupid.
And that makes me think that the heroes are also like incredibly stupid.
Like it makes their accomplishments a lot less impressive.
And I think there's actually a very compelling version of Carpathia that already exists.
His name is Adrian Veidt.
He is Ozymandias.
It is this idea that he's trying to do the greater good of the world, but just has this
like very warped idea of what that is.
Had we seen him actually take like more violent steps or like do things that were just more
evil than I would have bought him more as a demon than just like showing him with hollowed
on eyes at one point.
This is like a 15 book series.
So he's still ramping up his evil because I don't know, they're under the delusion right
now that they're going to somehow be able to make a movie of each book, which is just
not, of course, not going to happen.
They make one more movie called World at War, which tries to condense a few things.
But like, yeah, they need to build it up now because they already they already dropped
the shoe in the first movie.
He shot two guys and then hypnotized people.
So he's got to go further now.
We can't step back and just have him be like, I'm making one world currency and no religion
anymore.
I make no fancy bumper stickers.
They coexist.
The other thing, too, about Carpathia, you know, is that he is bamboozling everybody
except for Buck.
Right.
Buck being our hero.
He was not taken in by any of that bullshit.
Now, this is a difference between the movie and the book where in the book, not only was
Buck not taken in, but everybody else got hypnotized to think that Buck wasn't even there at all.
Why?
Why would Carpathia do that?
So that well, I'm glad you asked.
So that Buck's superiors would all be like, oh, you didn't show up to the important thing.
What's going on?
Are you really on your game anymore?
So that then Carpathia could manipulate him more easily into becoming his own like personal,
not press secretary, but like preferred journalist guy, basically.
But wouldn't Carpathia want him to be more powerful and more on top of his game so more
people would listen to him like they do in the movie?
Well, that's what he does.
He ends up pitching him on having an entire network of his own under the global homo.
Oh, so does he end up on TV in the books?
I don't know if he ends up on TV or not.
I think he might still be in print, but it's like he offers him the opportunity to be the
editor of the most important newspaper in the world.
Oh, so he would become like the Carpathian News Network or CNN.
I'm sure all of these details are just absolutely scintillating to the listeners.
That's the thing.
Is that like the details are all that this movie has?
Yeah.
Like, yeah.
If you build your whole thing on lore, you have to like go into and like study the nitty
gritty.
Like, for example, this world that's ended, this horrible hellscape has working TV, cell
service.
Right.
A pretty quiet life in the suburbs, all things considered.
Except for all of the guys who huddle around burning barrels like in Deus Ex and Battery
Park.
Yeah.
Okay.
So here's the thing.
Right.
These we see these teens, these like local teens trying to break into a destroyed van who
are then shot down by just like a roving band of like law enforcement.
Yeah.
I mean, fair, fair to the picture of law enforcement.
This scene is full, just straight out of A Thief in the Night, right?
Where you had those UN troops like patrolling in tanks.
Right.
These guys just see like, this isn't even really a crime.
This is a burned out van that no one's using.
And so these guys are just trying to jimmy a lock and then the UN guys are just like,
blammo, blammo.
Yeah.
Kirk Hammer looks so cool riding up on his little motorcycle, vroom, vroom.
And he's like, why did you kill them?
Why did you?
You couldn't have done this.
Well, yeah, anyone should have done this.
And they're like, well, because we wanted to or whatever.
And they marched away.
Right.
But it's like, okay, so this is a world of complete moral depravity, right?
These are like the worst of the worst people left behind.
In fact, AJ, it's a world of total depravity.
Oh, we're halfway there.
But there's, oh God.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I leaned on the Josh button just a little.
My bad.
But I don't understand why they draw the line at breaking into a car where like murder is legal.
People are having sex in the street or whatever.
But people are having sex in the street, AJ.
That doesn't happen.
You can't just insert your own fantasy into this movie.
Well, then what's the depravity then?
They don't show it.
It's the Adventures in Odyssey problem, right?
I think this speaks to the historical presence of this and A Thief in the Night, whereas A Thief in the Night, which had even less money and couldn't afford any extras.
When they show the UN troops patrolling, all the streets are empty, right?
All of downtown Des Moines is devoid of people.
Which is how things would be under martial law.
You wouldn't go outside.
Right.
Whereas here in the post like Reagan era, you get this belief, this increasing and often very thoroughly articulated in the case of Orson Scott Card belief that martial law is going to somehow come hand in hand with increased inner city street crime.
Right.
Because these people see like a black kid breaking a window as the same persecution of them personally
as like the government coming to their home and stealing their Bibles.
Jesus Christ.
Orson Scott Card believed that Obama was going to do that, by the way.
Did he really?
He wrote about it in his blog.
Oh, good.
In 2008.
And it's so funny.
That man has taken the closet to the ultimate extremes.
That man is so gay that he just became Hitler.
I want to talk a little bit about the dialogue in this movie if we could, because I know we're going to get into like the lore specifics, but I just want to give a shout out to how deeply and specifically terrible the dialogue is.
Oh, yeah.
Because even Josh, you sent us over a couple of things because Brian and I are illiterate, but you did send us over some pages from the book.
Yeah.
Little excerpts here and there.
Yeah, they got those little funny pictures all over them.
In the lines.
In the lines.
When I read them, sometimes like sounds happen in my head, but.
Sometimes I get fluids coming out of parts of me.
Wait.
Fluids coming out of parts of you?
Hmm.
What?
Funny little pictures?
What?
What is this?
What is this?
Anyway, so there's a bit where this piece of dialogue comes roaring to the foray and it goes a little something like this.
It's only natural that people are going to try to return to the ancient symbols of their religion to find answers.
You can't just shut down the Wailing Wall.
But it's being described as a safety precaution.
Yes, yes.
The UN did shut down one of the world's holiest sites.
But look what happened.
Oh.
Three men were burned to death.
Well.
Did they have any other choice?
But what really happened?
How did they die?
People don't just burn to death in the middle of the day.
When?
When do they burn?
Midnight.
Every night.
I feel like, you know, it's the Levant.
The sun is hot and bright.
You know, the whole place is hot.
That's when I would expect someone to burn to death.
Right.
Honestly.
I don't understand the point that it's trying to make.
I don't understand the sentence structure.
It has to be a quote from the book.
Right, Josh?
Yeah, I think it is.
I mean, so here's what this is.
This this is all referring to.
Right.
Is that there's these two guys.
And they're hanging out by the Western Wall of the temple in Jerusalem.
Right.
And according to Tim LaHaye's theology about all of this, this is a very literal thing
that comes straight from the Bible where there's going to be these two prophets who
are speaking out about what's going to happen and they will breathe fire, I guess.
I don't actually.
I wasn't able to find the verse.
Were you?
I love.
So, yeah, this is one of my favorite little chapters.
I was a big revelation.
Okay, cool.
I knew I could count on you.
I didn't.
You know, I wasn't a big left behind head.
Of course, I had seen these two movies.
I never watched World at War, but like I did love the book of Revelation.
So this is one of my favorite chapters because it gets so specific in such bizarre ways.
And I just kind of want to read through all of this section.
If you will indulge me.
Okay.
This is the two witnesses.
This is the revelation of St. John.
Chapter 11.
I was given a reed like a measuring rod and I was told go and measure the temple of God
and the altar with its worshipers.
But exclude the outer court.
Do not measure it because it has been given to the Gentiles.
They will trample on the holy city for 42 months.
And I will appoint my two witnesses and they will prophesy for 1260 days clothed in sackcloth.
I don't know why I said sackcloth that way.
Clothed in sackcloth.
They are, quote, the two olive trees, end quote.
And the two lampstands.
And they stand before the Lord of the earth.
He didn't like lampstands.
I guess because they breathe fire, I get it.
It's just such a strange turn of phrase.
All of this is very strange.
The number specificity has always been a very strange sticking point for John.
Yeah.
Yeah.
If anyone tries to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and devours their enemies.
This is how anyone who wants to harm them must die.
They have power to shut up the heavens so that it will not rain during the time that they are prophesying.
And they will have the power to turn the waters into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they want.
Wow.
So they get access to all ten immediately.
They could just keep taking out firstborn sons as often as they want to.
And stuff that doesn't happen, I guess it probably happens in the next book, is the stuff that we get more specific numbers and things like that.
So now when they have finished their testimony, the beast comes up from the abyss and will attack them and overpower and kill them.
Their bodies will lie in the public square of the great city, which is figuratively called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.
For three and a half days, some from every people, tribe, language and nation will gaze on their bodies and refuse them burial.
The inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and will celebrate by sending each other gifts, because those two prophets had tormented those who live on the earth.
After three and a half days, the breath of life from God entered them and they stood on their feet and terror struck those who saw them.
Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, come up here.
And they went up to heaven.
Get over here.
Get over here.
Get over here.
Get over here.
Get over here.
Get over here.
Get over here.
And they went up to heaven in a cloud while their enemies looked on.
At that very hour, there was a severe earthquake and a tenth of the city collapsed.
7,000 people were killed in the earthquake and the survivors were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.
The second woe has passed.
The third woe is coming soon.
Whoa.
And there it is.
These two guys in the book, especially are the focus of most of it, which again, which they should be because it's kind of cool.
I actually do want to read mutants for God's sake.
I mean, one of the few times that Jerry Jenkins is actually a compelling writer is when he's writing violence.
He should.
Sure.
We might remember this as well from the first one where the way that he described the murder happening, right?
When Carpathia killed those guys is actually pretty creepy.
The way that he describes these guys breathing fire is pretty cool, too.
This is on page 323 in the trade paperback.
Buck reached into his bag and turned on the tape recorder.
The man ran to the front of the crowd.
The two witnesses stopped preaching and stood shoulder to shoulder, glaring at the gunman as he approached.
He ran full speed, firing as he ran, but the preachers stood rock solid.
Not speaking, not moving, arms crossed over their ragged robes.
When the young man got within five feet of them, he seemed to hit an invisible wall.
He recoiled and flipped over backward, his weapon clattering away.
His head smacked the ground first, and he lay groaning.
Suddenly, one of the preachers shouted,
You are forbidden to come nigh to the servants of the Most High God.
We are under his protection until the due time,
and woe to anyone who approaches without the covering of Yahweh himself.
And as he finished, the other breathed from his mouth a column of fire that incinerated the man's clothes,
consumed his flesh and organs, and in seconds left a charred skeleton smoking on the ground.
The weapon melted and was fused to the cement,
and the man's molten necklace dripped gold through the cavity in his chest.
Hell yeah, dude.
I do like to imagine that all his skin burns off,
and the skeleton says,
It's a living!
And then he falls to the ground.
Here's the thing, like, we got two guys,
they are in the holiest place on earth,
they are spitting fire,
and not, bars, bars.
They are speaking in a way that all people from all backgrounds,
countries all over the world,
can instantly understand.
These men are podcasters, folks.
So the question is,
which one of us has to go?
Oh, it's me.
It's 100% me.
I'm the guy who ran into the invisible wall,
and said it's a living before disintegrating.
It's like Ken in the Barbie movie,
like, trying to surf,
and then he hits the wave,
and he just spins around a million times.
But yeah, I mean, so these guys...
I'm just Ben Judah.
Thanks, AJ.
So these guys...
Ben Judah's mojo dojo casa house.
Yes!
Yes!
We're back!
We're cooking with fire!
No, keep going, keep going, keep going.
We're spitting fire, keep going.
That's it, that's all I have.
Okay.
I wasn't a huge fan of the movie.
Oh, Barbie?
Yeah.
Left Behind Tribulation Force.
No, big fan of Left Behind Tribulation Force.
Me too.
Okay, we have to back up a bit,
because we don't get to meet these two flaming dudes for a while, right?
That's true.
We just had to talk about them,
because they're so cool.
We had to.
They are so cool,
and should be the focus of this movie.
But actually, I will say that Brian,
having now listened to the original text,
it actually makes this movie infinitely less impressive.
Yeah.
Because it's not doing adaptation.
I think it thinks it's being very clever
in how it's doing adaptation,
but what it's actually doing is just very literal.
It's just a very literal reading.
But like, these guys, too,
it's like it's also not literal enough,
because it's like, oh yeah,
these guys just stand by the wailing.
The book makes it clear they're actually ambulatory.
They're walking around,
and they can stomp their feet
and kill all the plants around them, right?
They can just do plagues at will.
These guys are fucked.
They suck.
They're awful.
No, they suck in the movie.
They're just standing there
with these fucking children's Bible pageant-ass costumes.
One of them is wearing fake teeth for some reason?
I want to be clear,
you can watch this movie on YouTube.
Just cut ahead to the last half hour or so.
Skim around and look at this,
because that is one of the funniest scenes in the film.
It's really funny when they actually blow the fire, yeah.
But if they got really into the weird,
like, ancient Hebrew gematria,
kabbalistic stuff that's in the book of Revelation,
it would be much more interesting.
But they still have to kind of keep
their Tom Clancy-esque tone.
Yeah, no.
What we get instead is what everybody loves,
office politics.
Yeah.
Because, you know, Buck,
being the intrepid journalist that he is,
well, he's not going to let anybody
in the bureaucracy pin him down, right?
No.
Not his boss named Steve Plank.
I also wrote Steve Plank
and then underlined it five times.
He is the smallest possible measurement of Steve's.
You know what?
It was really unfortunate that he got,
he got promoted over Steve Cubitt.
I think that was,
I think it was really his time to shine.
He was just too large of a Steve.
People forget about Steve Handbreath.
That's the worst one, honestly.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Yeah.
Steve Plank.
Mm.
Mm.
Steve Cubitt.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Buck Williams?
Yeah.
What?
What is this?
What is this?
A news organization?
It is.
This is the global news network.
I see.
I see.
And you know what?
You know the best way to report news, Josh?
Yeah.
In the lobby of the building.
Yeah, for sure.
Where the door can open and close
during live broadcasts,
seemingly at will.
And, you know, around here,
I don't have the most detailed memory
of what happens in this part
because this movie, like,
doesn't fucking matter.
passes through like a sieve.
What I will say is that
I have a note here in all caps.
How much of this movie
is going to be people watching TV?
Because it's a lot.
Yeah.
And here's the thing is like,
they have established
the two men breathing fire
in some vague sense.
Guys have been,
guys have caught on fire
at the Western Wall.
It's closed off.
Big government trying to close everything.
Closing our schools.
Closing our beauty parlors.
What it should be.
If they can't afford to do
the Western Wall
and do the fire breathing
for the whole movie,
I get it.
But then you make it about Buck
following the trail, right?
Yeah.
You make it about him
doing some detective work.
And instead,
what we get is just
constant scenes
of Nicolai Carpathia
saying the exact same thing
over and over and over again
or other people saying
what Nicolai Carpathia just said.
There will be one government,
one religion.
Everything seems to be fine.
Well, and we get
a lot of meetings too,
which is another commonality
between the movie and the book.
So many meetings.
And one of the meetings
is at the church.
We've got Bruce.
And of course,
we'll remember that Bruce
is the pastor, right?
He's the one who...
He was the pastor
who didn't believe in God.
Didn't really believe in Jesus.
He also screams
one of the great lines
from that film.
He sure does.
I don't know if we still
hop back.
Oh, God!
There we go.
We love.
Yeah, but he's preaching.
He is preaching.
And sort of a core group
has now formed, right?
We've got Rayford Steele,
the airline pilot.
We've got Chloe,
his daughter.
Yeah.
Buck Williams.
We've got Bruce.
Hold on.
Hold on.
What is this?
No!
Some kind of a force?
Yeah.
Some kind of tribulation force?
Maybe.
The UN just wrapped up
another press conference.
Nikolai's not wasting any time.
The way they're talking,
he's not just
Secretary General of the UN.
Oh.
It's more like he's
President of the entire planet.
That's classic.
What are we going to do?
Only thing we can do.
Work together to share the truth
with anyone who will hear it.
Well, that's a pretty tall order.
Everyone in the world
thinks Nikolai is some sort of
superhero.
To convince him that he's a bad guy,
well, that's going to be...
Well, how do we stop him?
We can't stop him.
We can't change the events
of the Bible.
The Antichrist will be...
What are we doing?
What we have to do
is fight him.
All of us.
Together.
Form our own tribulation force.
What does that mean?
So, first of all,
the sirens?
Not on our end.
The Antichrist's apartment.
Yeah, I know.
For once.
For once.
Because I'm in Gallup, New Mexico, baby.
There are no vehicles here.
We ride nothing but horses.
It is my dream scenario.
This is sort of the moment here
where, you know,
this is 12 minutes into the movie
and they've said
the title of the movie.
Yay!
This is going to be
an organization
where they meet up
and they talk
and that's it.
That's the tribulation force.
That's...
15 bucks of this!
Of just...
You can't do shit!
God already got this figured out.
You just hang.
You just hang.
But I guess that's the thing
that I wanted to point up, right?
Is that this poses
a massive dramatic problem.
Yeah.
Right?
Because the entire point
of a story
is that your characters
need to have
some sort of agency
and they might not succeed
but they need to at least
have the possibility
of achieving their
their intended outcomes, right?
Yeah, yeah.
And it's even more explicit
in the book
where they never actually talk about
what they think they want to do.
They just pray all the time
and wait until God tells them
what to do.
It's so boring.
And again,
when you talk about God
in books
or you talk about,
you know,
any sort of higher power
like, say,
the island in Lost,
there is a point
where God is not real
in the books.
God is the author.
Right.
Because the author
is the one actually dictating
like the plot.
So really,
when they're praying,
they're just praying
to the author of Left Behind
and I don't know
how to tell them this.
You got to find
a better God, man.
Well, that's strange
that you say that
because I pray like
five Hail Jerry's
every morning.
So I don't...
Well, Jerry be Jerry!
Jerry be full of grace.
The Lord is with me!
Blessed is the fruit
of thy womb.
Jerry!
Jerry!
Fun thing about Jerry Jenkins,
also a blessed virgin.
Oh.
That's very true.
Really?
Hey, didn't even throw him
a handy at any point?
Doesn't count handy?
I don't think it was like that.
Doesn't count.
That's just like,
that's just a, you know,
that's just a friendly encounter
between two brothers in Christ.
I'm sure Kirk Cameron
got several during this filming.
I'm so sorry, Josh.
Please continue.
We're doing great.
We're doing great.
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year!
Kirk Cameron eats his own cum!
Keep going.
So, uh, that...
Allegedly.
Allegedly.
Allegedly.
Not actionable.
Parody, satire, Minecraft.
It is here that
H-A-G-T crosses a line
with the way of the master.
He freezes it
and puts it in old fashions.
He calls them
whiskey salties.
Anyway, please continue, Josh.
Well, so I...
To the point of
talking about
Hail Jerry's
and our Jenkins
made me think
about this book's
approach to Catholicism
because we had alluded
a little bit earlier
to how
it's not the most
pro-Catholic thing
in the world, right?
Yeah, but...
And this doesn't really
come through in the movie
because, again,
as you said, Brian,
it has to be marketable,
but AJ, being our resident Catholic,
I decided that
it might be nice
for you to have a chance
to read a little bit
of Jerry Jenkins'
thoughts on Catholics
or more likely,
honestly, LaHaye's
because, again,
we'll remember that
Tim LaHaye in the book
is the one who's really saying
this is how things are
and then Jenkins
is writing it out.
Sure.
But, yeah,
why don't you go ahead
and read that first excerpt
that I pulled
and it's the three screenshots
so just read them in order.
Right, do you want me
to do it like the audiobook?
Absolutely.
With Werner Herzog narrating?
Well, not Werner Herzog,
but...
Please, God.
It would take nine years.
Most interesting to Buck
was the interpretation
of the event
on the part
of other churchmen.
I love that sentence.
A lot of Catholics
were confused.
I mean, that's fair.
Because while many remained,
some had disappeared,
including the new pope.
Jude Law did not make it.
Jude Law flew right
into the sky
who had been installed
just a few months
before vanishing.
He had stirred up
controversy in the church
with a new doctrine
that seemed to coincide
more with the heresy
of Martin Luther
than with the historic
orthodoxy
they were used to.
It probably has very little
to do with Martin Luther's
theology at this point.
Oh, very little.
When the pope had disappeared,
some Catholic scholars
had concluded
that this was indeed
an act of God.
Let's see.
This is Peter Cardinal Matthews
of Cincinnati speaking.
I don't have
a Cincinnati accent.
Sorry, just do broadly Ohio.
What does Ohio sound like to you?
Great, he's from Boston.
Those who oppose
the orthodox teachers
of the mother church
were winnowed out
from among us.
This is a classic Ohio accent.
Peter Cardinal Matthews
of Cincinnati
a leading archbishop
at the book.
Scripture says
that in the last days
it will be
as in the days of Noah
and you'll recall
that in the days of Noah
good people were made
and evil ones
were washed away.
Thanks, Archbishop
Bart Rathbone.
So, Buck concluded,
the fact that we're still here
proves we're the good guys.
So Buck,
Buck in your estimation
is sort of like
weenie Sonic the Hedgehog?
Yeah, pretty much.
Cool.
I mean, he's Kirk Cameron.
It's like if Sonic
was a bottom
for once.
I would point so crassly,
Archbishop Matthews has said.
But yes,
that's my position.
What does that say
about all the wonderful people
who vanished?
That perhaps
they were not so wonderful.
And the children
and babies?
The bishop had shifted
uncomfortably.
Had shifted?
Oh, right,
because we're still
in the past.
The bishop had shifted.
This is horribly written.
Jesus.
Yeah,
he had actually shifted
two lines ago,
but Jerry only now
noted it.
It's like,
why?
It's the immediate past.
Yeah.
Dad,
I leave to God,
he said.
I have perhaps,
I have to believe
that perhaps
he was protecting
the innocents.
From what?
I'm not sure.
I don't think
apacryphal literally,
but there are dire predictions
of what might be
yet to come.
So you would not
relegate the vanished
young ones
to the winnowing
of the evil?
No.
Many of the young ones
who disappeared,
I baptized myself.
So I know they are
in Christ and with God.
And yet,
they are gone.
They are gone.
And we remain.
We should take
great solace in that.
Few perhaps take,
oh God,
now he's getting
a little sonic in me.
Few people take solace
in an excellency.
I understand that.
This is the very
difficult time.
I myself am grieving
the loss of his sister
and it aren't.
But they had left
the church.
They had?
Oh boy.
They had opposed
to teaching
wonderful women,
most kind.
He's going,
he's dropped out.
Your accent is bleeding
into so many
different territories.
You're actually going
to,
at some point
in this episode,
accidentally recreate
a real Romanian accent.
Yeah, we'll get there.
We're just shoving them
all together.
We're becoming more
and more Roman
as we go.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
More an antique Roman
than a Dane.
Yeah.
Well, when in Rome,
do a Romanian accent,
I guess.
Most earnest,
I must add,
but I fear
they have been
separated as chaff
from wheat.
Yet those of us
who remain
should be confident
in our standing
with God
as never before.
Buck had been bold
enough to ask
the Archbishop
to comment
on certain passages
of Scripture,
primarily Ephesians
2, 8 through 9.
For by,
oh, this is just
quoting the Bible.
This is just the Bible.
This is no one speaking.
This is just the Bible.
I can say this one
in my Bible voice.
Yeah, please.
For by grace
you have been saved
through faith
and that not
of yourselves.
It is the gift
of God,
not of works,
lest anyone
should boast.
Thank you,
the Bible.
The Sphinx
has spoken.
Now you see,
the Archbishop said,
this is precisely
my point.
People have been
taking voices
like that
out of context
for centuries
and trying to
build doctrine
on them.
But those are
other...
AJ said,
take voices
like that
out of context
because that is
his accent
saying the word
versus.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just to clarify.
Yeah, that is fair.
This is not in reference
to my excellent
voice work.
Which is good.
It's brilliant.
But there are
other passages
just like those,
Buck said.
I understand that,
but listen,
you're not Catholic,
are you?
No, sir.
Well, see,
you will not understand
the broad sweep
of the historical
choice.
Excuse me,
but explain to me
why so many
non-Catholics
are still here
if your hypothesis
is right.
God knows.
Archbishop Matthews
had said,
he knows hearts.
He knows more
than we do.
That's for sure,
Buck said.
Oh, yeah.
Cha-cha-cha-cha-cha.
What a roller coaster
that was.
None of the other
excerpts that I pulled
were as long
as that one,
but I pulled that one
specifically because
I wanted you to read
the whole thing, AJ.
I'm exhausted.
I'm spent,
like Kirk Cameron
over an ice cube tray.
Just spent.
I would say that
roughly a quarter
of the novel
Tribulation Force
is stuff like that.
Okay.
It is Buck Williams.
It's debates.
It is Buck owning people
with facts and logic,
but we do get a little bit
of that in the movie, too.
I can't sit there
and listen to that garbage.
What?
Save us from sin?
Nicolai's the Antichrist?
Come on.
I mean,
what is it with you people?
You think everyone's bad?
Well, I have something
to tell you.
There are lots of good
people in the world,
including me.
According to whose standards?
Yours are gods.
What?
You just said
you were a good person.
I mean,
do you think
you've kept
the Ten Commandments?
Yeah, pretty much.
I mean,
I'm not perfect,
but I've never killed anybody.
Okay, well,
have you ever lied?
Yeah, well,
who hasn't?
So what does that make you?
Human.
Come on.
If you've murdered somebody,
that makes you a murderer.
So if you've lied,
what does that make you?
Okay.
A liar.
You know,
the one that really got me
was, um,
Jesus said
whoever
looks at a woman
to lust after her
has already committed
adultery
with her in his heart.
You ever done that?
Yeah.
Guilty.
So this is basically
coming straight
from the Gospels.
Uh,
this is the scene
where Jesus
is doing his preaching,
his itinerant stuff,
and a rich guy
comes up to him
and he's like,
yeah,
and this rich guy's like,
well,
how do I get to be saved?
You keep talking
about salvation.
And Jesus is like,
well,
do you keep the commandments?
He's like,
yeah,
and then Jesus
sort of whittles that down.
He's like,
see,
you can't save yourself.
You have to follow me.
What they leave out here,
which is funny
because you could
totally keep this intact
and left behind
and not offend
to many people
is that Jesus says,
the only way to follow me
is by getting rid
of all your shit.
Right.
Sell all of you,
all that you have
and come on the dirt road
and literally follow me.
Right.
To which the guy
turns around
and goes home.
Uh,
but here,
Kirk Cameron
and Ray Comfort
apparently worked
on writing this stuff out.
We have two long
conversion scenes
in this one.
Yeah.
And,
and it's just like
the Baptist wet dream.
This is something
I saw in skits
doing world change
every year
was like,
here's what's going to happen.
Someone's going to talk to you.
They're going to be like,
I think I'm good enough.
I follow the 10 commandments
as a non-Christian.
And it's like,
uh,
no one's going to talk
to you like this.
No,
you,
you,
you say that Brian,
but,
um,
I,
I told you this.
I briefly mentioned.
Yeah.
I'm,
I'm back in Michigan right now.
And while I was out
and about two days ago,
somebody,
I was just shopping
at like this dumb
little knickknack store
and somebody witnessed to me.
what?
Yeah.
Did you at least have
your family's ceremonial sword?
I sadly did not have
the ceremonial sword
on me at the time,
but she did.
a woman?
Yeah.
A woman.
She,
and she did want
to let me know,
uh,
like how,
how God loves me.
And,
you know,
she just wanted me
to know that.
She just wanted me
to know that God loves me.
What did you,
did you say thank you
and send her underway?
Like,
how do you,
how do you respond?
How do you respond
to a witnessing?
Um,
it depends on,
well,
you gotta go,
I don't know about
all this Bible thumping,
man.
That's how you gotta do it.
I'm a pretty good person.
That's how you gotta do it.
I never killed anybody
and then that's when they,
they're like,
I've trained for this moment
my entire life.
But if you're not that,
uh,
courageous,
um,
the,
probably the better way
to go about it
is just be like,
thank you.
I,
you know,
I appreciate that.
Yeah,
that's,
that's kind of,
God loves you too.
Thanks.
I witnessed the thing
in this movie
and this is like
sort of the ideal way.
Like if you could like
map out a perfect conversation,
this is,
this is probably
how it would go,
right?
If you were trying
to convert somebody
to Christianity.
But,
you know,
as we see,
like Carpathia has
a lot of these people
like under his thumb
and even in the church
where like they're trying
to like sell
the whole idea
of the apocalypse
and like coming to Jesus
as a way of repentance
to get out of the apocalypse.
There are a lot of like
naysayers in there too.
Yeah.
But our,
our good,
our good friend,
uh,
Oh God,
uh,
Bruce,
uh,
he forgot his name.
Didn't notice.
I mean,
it's so hard to keep track.
I mean,
wait,
but Bruce.
Yeah.
He tries to sell them all,
uh,
on this apocalypse thing
and there's a lot of like
people there
are a little bit skeptical
including the daily shows
own Jason Jones.
What the fuck?
I wanted to just spend
one more moment as well
talking about the piece
of the conversation
that we had listened
to a moment ago,
right?
Yeah.
Buck,
uh,
and that man
and owning that man
with facts and logic,
right?
Oh,
nanny that man.
You had,
you had mentioned
Brian Ray comfort
and I think that it might
be a good opportunity
here for those who
aren't familiar
with Ray comfort,
uh,
to just sort of explain
what that guy's deal is
because I also didn't know
that Ray comfort
worked on this movie.
So here's the thing guys,
I'm not actually happy
to see you.
I've got,
uh,
something in my pocket.
I'm pulling it out
right now.
Yeah.
This is an atheist's
worst nightmare.
Oh no,
it's a banana.
That's my worst.
That's an atheist's
worst nightmare.
Ray comfort hosted
a web series.
And I think it was also
on TV with Kirk Cameron
called the way of the
master,
where,
uh,
he talks about how
evolution is fake.
I remember when,
when I was starting
college,
he had just put out a
documentary about abortion
where he would go up to
people,
uh,
shove a microphone in
their face and just say,
you ever heard Adolf Hitler?
And people would be like,
what the fuck did you just
say?
Yeah.
Adolf Hitler.
Yeah.
The guy did the Holocaust.
World War II.
Please tell me he was doing
this shit like in Germany.
He was doing this in like
Venice beach.
He's like walking up to the
fucking like gold gym
weightlifters and be like,
you've heard of Adolf Hitler?
So Ray Comfort would go
around and he'd just do this
thing about,
you know,
who Hitler was.
Have you heard of Adolf
Hitler?
No.
You don't know who he is?
No.
You know,
it's not that people didn't
know who Hitler was.
They just had no idea what
the fuck he was saying.
The impression that y'all
are giving is that he
sounds Romanian.
Am I wrong?
So Ray Comfort like
explains the Holocaust and
all the people that died
and everything.
And then he's like,
that's like the really,
that's like a really shitty
version of Joe Parra talks
to you.
Ray Comfort explains the
Holocaust to you.
And,
and what he does is he then
is like,
well,
you know how many babies
are aborted each year?
It's,
it's the same as the
Holocaust really.
Oh God.
And,
oh God.
And yeah,
so he's just like,
yeah,
so when you abort,
you're doing the Holocaust.
That's,
this is his thing.
This is his shit.
When I was looking up,
there's a,
there's a section where
they're talking about
how Nikolai Carpathia,
he's going to get a peace
treaty with Israel.
And that's,
that's the worst thing
in the world,
right?
I was looking up
whatever verse they
thought they were
referencing with that one.
It's a verse in Daniel,
not important.
But what I found on my
first Google result
was an article about,
uh,
whoever negotiates peace
between Israel and Hamas
in this current conflict,
there's a brand new article,
is going to be the
Antichrist.
I click through.
Who wrote that article?
Was it fucking Ray Comfort?
It was Ray fucking Adolf Hitler Comfort.
My God.
A V Swiss nightmare.
He's probably said this
about millions of
conflicts before.
Here's the thing is that
with,
with,
with Kirk Cameron,
with Buck Williams
and Kirk Cameron,
who are,
who are two different guys,
actually,
um,
they have made a
Comfort
out of,
out of ice.
It's a very famous
tourist destination.
It only lasts a very
limited amount of time
because Kirk Cameron
just gobbles that shit up
pretty quickly.
You know,
you have,
it's a very limited window,
but you too can,
can get,
can,
it's like a salt lick.
It is a limited window
because it's so milky white.
So,
as,
as we saw,
the Daily Show's own
Jason Jones
in the pew,
in the church,
just before this sinner
got owned.
The whole reason
Sinner Man busted out
of this church
in the first place
is because he's hearing
some uncomfortable truths
about everybody's
new favorite friend,
Nikolai Carpathia.
Now,
who is this first horseman?
I believe he represents
the Antichrist.
Why do you believe that?
Is he gonna kill us all?
No,
no.
Other passages
make it clear
that he would triumph
not through force,
but through diplomacy.
That sounds fine.
Through peace,
through a false peace
that promises world unity.
Does that sound
familiar to anyone?
That's what
Nikolai Carpathia
is trying to do.
And we also,
we get a PowerPoint
presentation along with this,
right?
You see like the guys
breathing fire at one point.
You see this guy
on a horse.
Yeah,
and that.
Oh,
shit.
Wait,
what's that sound?
Fuck God damn it,
AJ.
What is that?
Ooh,
yeah.
AJ's horse corner.
So the horse here.
Yeah.
It is one of the
four horsemen
of the apocalypse.
It is specifically
the horse of war.
It is this giant
white stallion
that is giving some
really like
half-lidded eyes
at you.
It's giving some real
cry havoc
and release the dogs
of me
vibes.
I'd like to get
a couple of my
closest friends together
and puppeteer
that war horse
till we all win
some Tonys.
This has been
AJ's horse corner.
Ooh,
yeah.
AJ's horse corner.
Is winning a Tony
what you call it
when you make
your dad laugh?
Yeah.
Aww.
That's his name.
That's his name.
Antoinette Diddy.
That's what Tony
is short for.
A couple pieces
here as well.
Like,
we've got this sermon.
We've heard Buck
own that man
with facts and logic.
The thing about
that man,
though,
is that he's
sort of a stand-in
for all of the people
who are still
won over by Carpathia,
right?
Yeah.
And this man decides
that he's going to
fucking kill himself
by playing
Spin the Gun.
Which is a classic
game to play.
You know,
you've probably seen
some famous images
of people spinning
their guns.
Walter White
comes to mind,
right?
Yes, yes, yes.
He's just spinning around
and then the gun
happens to point
to a potted plant
that then becomes
very important
to the very end
of season four.
Right.
And this guy
has never spun
a gun in his life
and he is fighting
for his life
to get that gun
to spin.
He's getting his
whole hand on it.
I don't think he's ever
held a gun in his life.
No.
The way that he was
like holding the gun,
very strange.
Very, very strange.
Which is also,
like,
you can do that.
You can do that.
Like,
this is a guy
who's never owned a gun
and he's gone out
to buy it
and he's gonna...
Right,
but you need to
make that the choice.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
you can't have him
like pretend
to be fancy.
Right.
They're like,
you know what's cool?
You know what's a cool thing
I saw in a John Woo movie?
A guy spinning a gun
while he was thinking
about killing himself.
It's like,
just don't do it.
So,
Ray,
not Ray Comfort,
but Ray does come
to Comfort.
Rayford Steele
Comforts this man
who I guess is his friend,
maybe another pilot,
I don't know.
Yeah,
basically Rayford
has invited this man
to church,
but because Buck
has decimated him
with facts and logic,
he's like,
well,
I gotta kill myself now.
Yeah.
Nice witness there.
So basically,
Ray is confronted,
like he has to do
a persuasion role,
right?
Yeah,
yes he does.
He passes.
So if there's a God
and there's a heaven,
why are we here?
Why aren't we in heaven?
Because we weren't right
with God.
Wait,
hold on.
No.
Chris.
Chris,
you can pull that trigger.
I can't stop you,
but if you do,
you are never gonna
see your wife again.
Is that what you want?
She's in heaven
with my wife
and my son.
She committed to God.
My wife.
And she is in heaven.
And if she's not,
if they're not,
then where are they?
You tell me,
where are they?
You can guarantee me
that there's not a heaven.
Can you guarantee that
100%?
What if you're wrong?
You want to be with them,
don't you?
I know you do.
And they want you
to be with them.
Now you have got
to make a decision.
It's the biggest decision
of your life.
Stop exhaling
after every line.
Trust your wife.
What are you,
me?
Chris,
you need to trade
that gun
for God.
You need to put
your faith
and your trust
in God
and you need
to do it
right now.
Okay,
so question
for the two of you.
Yeah.
Do you think
that this scene
is in the book?
No.
I'm gonna,
the way it's phrased,
you phrased that question,
I'm gonna say
it's not in the book.
Correct.
Yeah.
Did you have that sense
while watching the movie
that this was something
that was added
for the movie?
I had that sense,
sorry,
I had that sense
because of the first movie.
Right.
Because the first movie
spends so much time
on listening to like
Bleach and Switchfoot
and watching people
do the conversion story
because they're trying
to use the movie
to reach non-Christians
whereas the book
is written for Christians.
Right.
Exactly.
Yeah, yeah.
I think that's very interesting.
I also think that like
it just seems so redundant
in the story
because we've already
kind of had
the facts and logic scene.
Yeah, yeah.
You know,
so it feels,
it just feels,
I mean,
this is all because
of Way of the Master,
this is all because
of Kirk and Ray Comfort,
this is all like happening
because they needed
to add this stuff in.
It was very hard
to pay attention
to the scene as written,
not even because
of the spinning gun
but because there was
just this enormous
model biplane
in the background.
Oh, yeah.
What was that all?
I was like,
I don't know,
this guy's super into planes.
Yeah.
I wanted to highlight
this part of the scene.
So if there's a god
and there's a heaven,
why are we here?
Why aren't we in heaven?
That's a very good question,
right?
Yeah.
He's not,
he's not,
the way that he says it
does not seem to be addressing
why are we here
right at this moment
after other people
have been raptured?
But that's the answer
Ray gives,
right?
We were here,
we're here
because we're not right
with God.
But why did God
put us here
in the first place
instead of just
populating heaven
with us?
Right.
Which Rayford just,
yeah,
he just makes it
about the immediate
instead of the general.
Right.
Like this guy's like,
I don't know, man.
I don't know.
I don't know.
What is,
it is also,
what is this?
What is this?
What is this?
A tribulation force.
It is,
it is a tribulation force.
I,
I think also that all,
this entire scene
operates on air bud logic
to me.
There's no rule
in the book
that says a dog
can't play basketball,
which is the exact
same argument as
you can't prove to me
that there is no heaven.
Yeah.
Just because
it's not written down
doesn't make it true.
Do you know what I mean?
Right, right.
Even if they're trying,
because what they're trying
to do desperately
is to be facts
and logic guys,
right?
To own you with facts
and logic,
but they don't have it.
They don't have any facts
and logic.
So they have to like
use the language
that makes it sound
like they do,
but there's no argument
at the core of it
other than,
well,
nah.
Yeah,
they can't,
they can't articulate
the arguments of the people
that they have the differences with,
which is why you just sort of
hear people say,
especially the Carpathia pitch,
you just hear it
over and over and over again
in the exact same way
each time.
They can't deepen it
in any way
and they're,
and they're afraid
to engage with it
because it might weaken
their faith if it does,
right?
Right.
There's this idea
that there are certain
ideas that you cannot approach
that you should not
embed yourselves in
in the first place
because it's going
to weaken your faith.
So another thing
that happens here
is that their picture
of salvation
and their scripts
for salvation
are the same things
that you would read
and attract in the year 2000.
Yeah.
They are built for,
what these people believe in
is something called
dispensationalism,
which is essentially
there are two,
there are multiple phases
of existence
in the relationship
between humans and God,
right?
There was a dispensation
where people were
in the Garden of Eden.
There was a dispensation
where people like Moses
were talking directly to God.
There was the dispensation
of the time before Jesus came
and then the nature
of salvation,
the nature of,
of an actual covenant
with God changes
after the death
and resurrection
of Jesus Christ.
It happens once more
once you find yourselves
in the end times,
which means that
the conversation
around salvation
is a totally different one.
You are no longer
just turning your soul over
and throwing away
your addictions
and sins.
No, you are joining an army
in this belief structure.
You are joining an army
against the Antichrist.
That's what the tribulation
force exists for
is to build up something
that will actually fight
the Antichrist
once Jesus returns.
That all makes sense
in the context of a story,
right?
Of a novel.
We have created this world
in which there is going
to be an epic conflict
and you need to choose
what side of that epic
conflict you are on.
But the strange thing
about the book
and especially the movie
is that it is simultaneously
using this as an arg
for why you,
yes, you,
right now watching this movie
should become a Christian.
But it doesn't make sense.
It's a different dispensation.
It's a different dispensation.
And also,
you are basically,
it's like if there were
a Marvel movie
where it's like,
well,
you can either be
one of the Avengers
in real life
or you can be against us.
Like,
it just doesn't make sense.
No, no.
Because not all of us
can breathe fire.
Like,
two witnesses can.
Two of us can.
Two of us can, AJ.
Yeah, I can.
Two of us can, Antoinette Jr.
Okay,
and here's the other point
just in terms of
pure storytelling, right?
Yeah.
You cannot have
an all-powerful God
that loves and cares about you
and also have dramatic stakes
because God can just
snap his fingers
and everything's fixed.
Do you know what I mean?
Well, then you get into
very complex issues
about theology
and what God does
and what he chooses to do
and what manifestations
of his love
are going to be, right?
But the only conclusions
that you can come to
of him not intervening
was like,
well,
they'll learn something
by actually fighting against this.
Right.
Or,
he doesn't give a shit
and he's collected
the people that actually love him
all together
and you're done.
And you're done.
It's over.
You're all on your fucking own.
Yeah.
And so,
it is wild to me
that one of the big
driving forces
of this movie
is people trying
to convince other people
that this God
that has abandoned you,
that has left you
to this destroyed world,
you should suck up
to him anyway
even after he's
completely fucked you over.
And the way that you
can do that, though,
the way that you can do that
is basically
you follow this dictator
or you follow that dictator, right?
Either the Antichrist
or the Lord God up above
who's the more powerful one
Yes.
But their narrative
of redemption,
of turning yourself over to God,
of becoming a believer
is based entirely
on the individual.
There is nothing
about the collective
and in fact,
that's the whole point
of Nikolai Carpathia
is to say that
any overtures
towards collectives,
towards people
working together
and fighting together
is actually satanic.
And of course,
this very naturally
leads into
what you see
with a lot of the
like QAnon
super-pilled logic,
right?
This is,
like,
this is,
the thing that I found
really interesting
about going back
to this movie
even more than
the first one
is how
so many of
the common things
that you will hear,
you know,
hyper-right-wing
pilled Christians say,
they are using
this stuff
as their source
of truth,
right?
And it bears repeating,
none of this is actually,
not none of this,
but very little of this
is actually from
the Bible,
right?
No,
this is 19th,
18th,
19th,
20th,
and 21st century theology.
Right,
and specifically,
it is Tim LaHaye's
own unique spin on this.
Yeah.
And so,
it's a very strange thing
where fiction
has sort of become
flattened
and become part
of a prevailing
religious narrative
because these books
and movies
were so predominant
in the pop culture
up until the year 2000.
And that's part of the reason
that the movie
doesn't have the same punch
either, right?
The movie was after
the year 2000.
That was when everything
was supposed to happen
and it fucking didn't happen.
Right,
but then it's like,
hey,
maybe it still could.
They could.
Just give it a couple more years.
Just keep moving those goalposts.
And I think I talked
about this before.
You can find books
where like Tim LaHaye
wrote the foreword
that's like all about
how Saddam Hussein
is fulfilling prophecies
and going to build
the next Tower of Babel.
Oh,
so Saddam Hussein
was going to be
the Antichrist basically?
Oh,
yeah.
And the book got updated.
I remember finding this
in a bookstore in like 2008
and it was still wrapped
in plastic
like an old porno manga.
and it was like updated
like a copy of Admiral Husband,
for example.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was like updated
with new information.
It's this picture
of Saddam Hussein
and it's like he's been dead
for a few years now.
Like it's over.
He didn't come back.
Right.
Yeah,
no,
of course.
After three days.
It turns out that this guy
that we were just like
working up a war against
for really no reason
in the early 90s
isn't actually all that important
at the end of the day.
Well,
in Admiral Husband,
the dating sim,
by the way,
the dating sim,
not the original manga.
Not the manga adaptation.
Yeah.
The dating sim.
Yeah.
It's really important
to get the patch actually.
Like version two
is actually a lot better.
It includes some
additional storylines.
You have the ability
to romance
to Admiral's husband,
which is pretty wild.
Yeah.
What I didn't like
was that the patch,
the patch really
kowtowed to the fans.
Oh,
yeah.
And they changed the artwork.
Because the original one,
they're all boats.
They're just boats.
Right.
Yeah.
They revamped it.
JPEGs of boats.
Yeah.
And now they're
anthropomorphized.
Right.
And it's like,
yeah,
I get the vibe
of the boat.
He's still got the masts
and the cannons
and things,
but like that
doesn't work for me.
I'm psyched.
I don't need
the USS Minneapolis
having abs.
No.
All it needs
is that fucking hull.
It's like
a long,
hard hull.
When I asked for guns,
I didn't mean muscles.
I meant guns.
Guns.
Anti-aircraft.
What if they get
attacked from the skies?
They need cannon for that.
Oh my God.
Give me those flags
that designate exactly
the spot where they're from
and where they,
what port of call
they have.
Oh my God.
Give me those,
give me those yellow
and black checkered
beauties up there.
and I just get,
just,
just,
I have one more.
Yeah,
please.
Just fucking,
just release all that
semaphore all over my face.
God.
So the reason that
I've been raising
all of this,
raising these flags
to do with dating.
I'm already half-masked.
Hell yeah.
Is that dating
is actually a big piece
of tribulation force.
Oh hell yeah.
That might be exciting to you.
This is a rom-com,
surprisingly.
This is a rom-com.
And we're going to throw
to a commercial from
and hold on.
Okay.
If I'm,
I'm reading this.
Kirk Cameron.
Oh.
Hey there fellow sinners.
Kirk Thomas Cameron here.
Star of the hit
Left Behind trilogy
and Mercy Rule.
A film where I,
Kirk Cameron,
play a father
helping his son
fulfill his dreams
of becoming a baseball pitcher
while heroically
saving my small business
from the evil machinations
of lobbyists.
That's real.
That's a real movie
I made.
With money.
Christ lovers,
has this ever happened
to you?
You're trying to meet
a single faith-minded
individual in your area,
but all the Christian dating apps
are filled with
too many ding-dang farmers?
Then you need
Kirk-er.
The first dating app
exclusively for dating me,
Kirk Cameron.
Why roll the dice
with other Christian dating apps
which might be crawling
with people who want to kiss you
or worse,
Catholics,
when you can download Kirk-er
and instantly match with me,
Kirk Cameron,
so you can experience
the joy of falling in love
with the star
of the fifth highest rated sitcom
of 1987.
Other Christian dating apps
encourage you to kiss
outside of marriage,
but with Kirk-er,
you'll never have to worry
about that
because I,
Kirk Cameron,
exclusively kiss my wife.
Then what's in it for you,
I hear you ask?
Oh, simple.
Kirk-er will make you my wife.
No.
I mean,
you will literally
become her.
It'll start slowly at first.
Suddenly your morning coffee
will taste just a little off
or your favorite pair of shoes
will be slightly too big,
but then
things will start
to become more noticeable.
You'll feel your voice change.
You'll feel your balance falter.
Your hair will fall out in clumps
and your bones will grow
and shift and crack
as little by little.
Every piece of you
is replaced by the angelic body
of my own beloved wife.
You'll stare in the mirror,
a stranger staring back at you.
And as the last bit of your brain
is usurped,
you will have one final terrifying thought.
Am I still me?
Am I still me?
So download Kirk-er today,
the first dating app
that was built to delete you.
Kirk-er,
the key to eternal wife.
So thank you, Kirk Cameron,
for whatever that was.
He got his daily supply of protein,
I'll tell you that.
And good for him.
I'm coming!
So much of Tribulation Force,
both the movie and the book,
is a rom-com?
Wait, the book too?
Yay!
I didn't know it was the book.
Oh, no.
Even more of the book
is that fucking...
So, I might as well clear...
Was there even a thing
in the first movie?
So, I'm gonna clear, yes,
and I'm going to clear for you both now
what happens in the book
before we get into talking about
what happens in the movie.
Does he stick it in her?
He does not.
But he sure wants to.
I'm going to have Brian...
Okay.
...read the next excerpt here
from the book.
I'm just curious.
This is Rayford and Chloe...
Oh, boy.
...going to Bruce
to talk about whether or not
it's ethical to date
and potentially even have children
during the Tribulation.
Sure.
I'm just curious about the logistics,
Rayford explained.
If two people fell in love,
what should they do about it?
Does the Bible say anything
about a marriage during this period?
Not specifically,
Bruce said.
As far as I can tell,
but it doesn't prohibit it either.
And kids?
Would it be prudent for a couple
to bring children into this world now?
I haven't thought about that.
Oh, yeah.
Inspector Gadget.
No, it's still Bruce.
You're good.
Yeah, yeah.
It's also Inspector Gadget.
It's Maxwell Smart.
Yeah.
I haven't thought about that,
Bruce said.
Would you want another child
at your age?
Bruce,
I'm not looking to marry again.
I'm thinking of Chloe.
I'm not saying she has any prospects,
but if she did...
Bruce squeaked back in his chair.
Imagine having a baby now,
he said.
You wouldn't have to think
about junior high school,
let alone high school or college.
You would be raising that child,
preparing him or her
for the return of Christ
in just a few years.
You'd also be guaranteeing
a child a life of fear and danger
and a 75% chance of dying
during the judgments to come.
It's a specific number,
so I guess in that way
it is very much like Revelations.
Bruce rested his chin in his hand,
elbow on the desk.
True enough, he said.
I'd have to advise a lot of caution,
prayer, and soul searching
before considering that.
What do you know?
It's Friday.
Friday.
So, Rayford here is...
Go-go gadget anti-natalism.
Go-go gadget anti-Semitism also.
Oh boy.
Yeah.
There we go.
It's part two.
It's part two,
and we're going to be...
Gerard de part two.
...delving more into the true Messiah
a little bit later,
but for now,
we're going to stay focused
on Rayford Steele
and his desire for his daughter
to have a good relationship.
Hey, hey, oh.
Oh, whoa, hey.
Penny, you should go fuck my best friend.
Yeah, we've got a situation here
where father knows best, right?
Rayford's really been seeing
that Buck has an interest
in his daughter, right?
And he ultimately has some affection
for Buck.
Is that an atheist's worst nightmare
in your pocket, Buck?
Are you just happy
to see my daughter, Chloe?
Let's compare this then
with how this sort of goes down
in the movie, right?
Yeah.
Because in the movie...
Oh, Chloe's so mad.
Oh, she's so mad.
She's so mad.
She's very mad.
Listen, I know that you're concerned
about your dad.
I do not want to talk
about my family.
Ooh, Canadian.
Chloe, I feel like there's something
you're not telling me.
The boot.
I think you're a wonderful guy,
but I'm having a really hard time
with this whole hanging out
with the devil thing.
I don't even know
if you're going to be alive tomorrow.
And so Chloe in the movie is...
Yeah.
I mean, she's just so...
She's so mad.
And nevertheless,
she has strong desires for Buck.
And so she goes to his apartment
because she wants to tell him
how she really feels.
And the dress she is wearing
is so fucking heinous in this scene.
It's really bad.
It's really quite bad.
It's really quite bad.
It's really quite bad kind of stuff.
I will say she also gives off
the vibe of Rachel McAdams
in Slings and Arrows.
Like, I don't know if it's just
like a very specific kind of Canadian.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
A different cultivar, yeah.
So Buck has had this whole thing
where his journalism assistant
is back in the country.
She has backpacked her way to New York
and plopped her giant camping backpack
down in the middle of the office
and is like, I'm in town.
My fiance's not here yet.
And Buck is like, okay,
live at my enormous,
like heavy rain level apartment.
Yes.
Which is in Chicago somewhere.
Yeah.
Question mark.
I like the idea of Kirk Cameron
just trying to reach down
to pick something up
and failing and reaching back down.
Oh, fuck.
A fucking David Cage
left behind game
would actually fucking whip ass.
I would be so in favor of it.
that you could adapt
left behind into the video game format.
Yeah, I'm in steel.
It's me.
Now I'm in shade.
And open the door.
You just have more Canadians.
It's perfect.
Yeah.
I will say, like,
half the fucking actors
in this movie are Canadian
for some reason.
Yeah, I think it might be.
Well, it's shot in Canada.
Yeah, I think it's filmed up there.
They just cast locally
because they can't afford anything.
This movie is getting by on fumes.
So, yeah, Kirk has decided
to cohabitate with this woman,
which apparently the movie
does not really have a problem with.
Well, because they're not
actually romantically involved.
Sure, but still,
that is temptation.
He's inviting temptation
into the home.
You saw Fireproof.
He had to get rid of the computer.
The scene.
That's too many boats on it.
Exactly.
The scene with
Admiral Husband.
Him and his
He got the patch.
Journalism assistant, question mark.
She is very clearly
like into him, you know?
Yeah.
His assistant of journalism.
She also wants to protect him, I guess.
So, here she is answering the door
when Chloe comes by.
I'm looking for Buck Williams.
What?
What?
Uh, does Buck Williams live here?
What do you want?
You want an autograph or something?
Is that what you want?
He's about to seduce her?
Let me give you some advice, okay?
You're not the first one
to follow him home,
so why don't you just
skedaddle and
go play with some college boys,
okay?
Bye.
That's a strong choice.
Yeah, no, she does a great job
as the actor
with a terrible script.
What, also,
what is this life
that Buck is living?
Where women are following him home?
Is he an Aaron Sorkin protagonist?
He is, he is.
It also kind of sounds like
they have Kenny G
like locked
in like the basement
of this place.
Yeah, yeah.
Get me out of here.
Like, just like this echoing,
billowing thing in the background.
Like, it does sound very seductive.
No amount of circular breathing
will save you from the tribulation.
So, if you can believe it,
in the book,
this storyline is even more convoluted.
Jeez.
Okay, sure.
Because, I guess what's happening
in the book
is that because
it's Nikolai Karpathia's
master plan
to get Buck
to work for him
as the official news organ
of the United Nations
and also to get Rayford Steele
to fly his plane,
Hattie,
who we'll remember
is Rayford's
former flight assistant
who is now working
as a United Nation,
she is, like,
delivering flowers
to Buck's apartment
so that when Chloe
sees
the flowers
getting delivered,
he will think
that Buck already
has another girlfriend,
which is then
going to naturally
lead Chloe
to not want
to keep Buck around
so that Buck
can also go
and become
a United Nation.
Wow, I didn't know
I had to hand it
to the screenwriters,
but wow,
I gotta hand it
to the screenwriters.
They made this
so much more sensible.
Like, how does Hattie
know the comings
and goings of Chloe
at all times?
That's a very good question,
Brian,
and I do not have an answer.
The one I know of
is from Kirk Cameron,
and even then
he tries to hide
the evidence.
Right?
That hotel is so expensive
and it's not comfortable
at all.
No!
The blankets
are inadequate.
So here's the thing
about this whole storyline.
It's gross
and I hate it
because his assistant
is playing it
like she's the Joker,
and it's such a huge swing
that I have to, like,
admire on a certain level
just to, like,
make a choice
and, like,
commit to it,
including not having
a director to tell you anything.
There's also a little bit
of, like,
a Disney Channel
original movie
villain vibe to it,
which I appreciate.
There is a brief moment
where Raymond,
Rayford,
Raymond,
Rayford Steele!
Rayford Steele!
I used to jack off
to pictures of him
in fucking
International Mail
in 1992.
Wait, really?
No, AJ,
I'm saying he has
the name of a gay
porn model.
I see.
I see.
I thought,
I thought perhaps,
I thought perhaps,
this actor
really did for you.
I could see it.
I could see this actor
having,
no, it's not my,
watching Tribulation Force.
Not my kind of guy.
Not my kind of guy.
But he could be
somebody's kind of guy.
Yeah, he certainly could.
He certainly could.
I mean, he's,
I've never jacked off
to International Mail,
but I have been
intrigued by it.
I jacked off
to the International
before.
The clothing is unbelievable.
I actually own
a couple of
International Mail
clothes,
and I'm proud of it.
I'm not even ashamed.
And I should be.
But there is
a brief moment
where he's talking
to Bruce.
Hey, I got one right.
I got Bruce.
I'm worried.
No, no, it's Chloe.
Chloe is talking
to the preacher
and says like,
hey, I really,
I'm really interested
in a guy,
but I'm worried
he might die.
And there's a moment
where the preacher's like,
oh, we're gonna fuck,
are we?
And then she's like,
it's, it's,
it's, it's Kirk Cameron.
And the priest goes,
oh, and you just see
like this like dejected,
oh, I thought I had something.
And it was like
the one real moment
of acting.
So is she a high schooler?
This is the other thing.
No, she's a college student.
So Buck Williams,
who's 50 years old,
is,
depending on the version,
yeah.
Is dating a 20 year old girl?
Canonically,
canonically,
okay,
canonically.
Is he just out of college himself?
No, canonically,
I think he's 33.
Oh.
And she is not yet out of college.
She's like 20.
It's not good.
Oh dear.
It's not good.
Once upon a time,
in the far off land
of Toronto, Canada,
Buck Williams
was dating a high schooler.
Not to do age gap discourse,
but like this is,
this is just,
frankly,
it's unchristian.
This is,
this is giving,
this is giving
the appearance of evil,
if you ask me.
Oh yeah,
well,
you want to talk about
drinking IBC root beer,
you know?
You want to talk about
the appearance of evil?
AJ,
how about you read
the next excerpt
that I grabbed?
Oh baby.
Okay, sure.
Hey Brian,
can I get a little music
under this?
No.
Great.
Okay, no,
I'll do it.
Oh yay!
Okay.
Say please.
Please?
Say please.
Scrub daddy?
Oh god.
Yeah.
Oh god,
he's off the floor!
You know,
Brian just uses
that,
that Michael W.
Smith song,
but,
daddy's got
some music for you,
baby.
Daddy's got some music
for you,
my baby,
my tiny boy.
Can you at least
take the spoon
out of your mouth?
The spoon stays in.
Buck was pulling
into the parking lot
at New Hope Village Church,
just as Chloe
was pulling out.
They drew up
even with each other
and rolled down
their windows.
Hey little girl!
No.
Buck said.
No!
Is he even
talking about this church?
Chloe smiled,
just that it's
crowded every Sunday.
Good,
I'll try it.
So are you
taking the job?
I could ask you
the same question.
I've already
got a job!
Looks like I...
So proud.
He's covered in stickers
that he's given himself.
I have a job
and they pay me too!
I'm a big boy!
Looks like
I have one too,
she said.
No.
I learned more today
than I learned
in college last year.
How did it go with...
Wait, no, no, no,
sorry!
I hate to pop.
What does that mean?
I love going to college
and learning.
I love learning at college
where I go.
Yeah, but colleges
want teachers
the way church do.
But that's the thing,
that is where ladies go
to get more knowledge.
That's true.
Men, on the other hand...
We go to Jupiter.
Yeah.
Takes a long time.
Takes a while.
Well, I'm just reading
this recent report.
Apparently we get
more stupider.
No!
Wow!
And that's grammatically
correct to me
because I've been there.
How'd it go with Bruce?
I mean, did you tell
you knew he sent flower?
He sent the flowers?
Chloe looked over
his shoulder
as if afraid
Bruce might hear.
I have to tell you
all about it,
she said,
when we have
time.
After the meeting tonight?
She shook her head.
I was up too late
last night.
Some guy,
you know.
Really?
Yeah.
Couldn't get rid of him.
Happens to me
all the time.
Later, Chloe.
How was your sex life?
Anyway.
Buck couldn't blame Bruce
for whatever level
of interest he had
in Chloe.
It just felt strange
competing with your
new friend and pastor
for a woman.
So AJ,
you were reading into this
in the movie,
but in the book,
the pastor wants to
fuck this 16-year-old child.
Yeah,
and in the,
well,
first of all,
she's not 16.
I think she's 20.
She started college early.
Wait,
she started very early.
She's so smart.
She's so smart and young
and this is horrible
what they're doing to her.
It is horrible
what they're doing to her
because also,
yeah,
Bruce is,
I think,
canonically supposed
to be like in his 40s
and he's also,
like,
that's much more distressing.
Oh,
God.
Yeah,
he had a wife,
he had children.
Yeah.
They all got raptured.
Yeah,
he and Rayford
are roughly the same age.
So that's why
these guys weren't raptured
because they're pedophiles.
He is quite literally
old enough
to be her own dad
and I hate that.
Jesus.
Fuck God.
This is,
this is terrible.
I hate that I guessed it.
I hate that I inferred that.
Am I Jerry B. Jenkins?
Is Jerry B. me?
Jerry B.
Jerry B.
Jerry B.
Jerry B.
Jerry B.
Jerry B.
Jerry B.
Jerry B.
Jerry B.
Jerry B.
Jerry B.
Jerry B.
Jerry B.
Jenkins Diddy.
No!
Yeah,
do we think this is Jerry stuff?
Right?
Tim LaHaye's the ideology.
This is Jerry stuff.
This is definitely Jerry.
And Jerry just writes
on autopilot, right?
He's not like a guy
who thinks about craft.
So this is just a thing
that he wants.
This is just in his mind.
This is very similar to
20 year old.
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
Oh dear.
It's so,
like,
this stuff comes up
in these books
over and over
and over again.
I had no idea.
Yeah.
Well,
it's awful.
She wants to fuck
a 20-something.
Doesn't someone try
to force her
to have an abortion
or something?
Yes,
that happens
a little later on.
Oh no.
This is awful.
Not in this book,
in one of the other books.
No, later on.
People likes these?
I don't,
apparently.
No,
all you need to do
is go back to that movie,
AJ.
Go back to that movie
and scroll down
and read the comments.
Yeah,
read the comments
on YouTube.
They are obsessed.
What I also found out.
I've seen one of them
that like,
a woman saved her husband.
Yeah.
It was like the top one.
I don't remember
if I knew this
when we went into recording
last time
or if I learned it
in the meanwhile,
but there are
left behind audio dramas
and I don't mean
left behind kids.
Yeah,
we knew about that,
but there is
for the so-called
grown-up books.
Yep.
There are five-hour-long
audio dramas
for each one.
Yeah,
Tyndale House
did a series
of radio dramas.
They sound a lot
like Adventures in Odyssey.
The entire resolution,
right,
of the conflict
between Buck and Chloe
in both the book
and the movie,
it comes together
in a scene
where Chloe goes to,
well,
Chloe's at home,
right,
and she lives
with her dad.
Yes.
And Buck comes over
and just hangs out there
outside the house
for a while.
Yeah,
and she doesn't know
he's coming,
but he told Rayford
that he is
and Rayford's like,
this will be better
if she's surprised
and in her night clothes.
Like,
uh.
Yeah,
and there's,
and like,
this whole misunderstanding
has led to the point
where like,
when Buck calls up
Rayford to talk about things,
he says,
I'm actually a little bit frustrated
and you see a little bit
of that like,
simmering rage
that came through
in Fireproof.
Yeah,
the scary thing
that we noticed
in Fireproof.
Yeah,
it's like,
there's something about
Kirk Cameron's performance
that fundamentally scares me.
Like,
there's something that like,
because he's not a good enough actor
to be acting that rage.
He's really tight,
yeah.
And he comes over
and you're like,
how is this scene gonna end?
Is this gonna be another Fireproof
where he like,
puts his hand through a wall
and like,
corners her up against the wall
or something.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
And instead,
they just kind of hash it out
and they're happy with each other.
Yeah,
this,
this gets over immediately.
This just gets resolved
and it could have been resolved sooner
because Rayford could have
just said something.
Like,
it didn't need to be
this surprise meeting.
She was just confused
about something
because she apparently
just doesn't know anything
about Buck
and he knows nothing about her.
Well,
she doesn't know anything
about anything.
In the book?
Tribulation forcing together.
Yeah.
We can't force a tribulation.
Now you can't.
It has to come about organically.
Speak for yourself.
I force my family
through tribulations
all the time.
Families plural.
I'm a bigamist.
I force,
I force tribulations
every time I look at
international mail.
I just really want that cravat
that's built into the shirt.
So,
that,
that shit,
by the way,
the like,
back and forth,
back and forth
is a solid quarter
of the book,
at least.
Oh,
God.
Insufferable.
And it's also,
looking at this book,
Josh,
that is a,
that is not a,
that is a thick book.
Oh,
it's not nearly as big
as it looks.
Look at the size
of the margins.
Oh,
it is still a thick book.
We had it in hardcover.
It looks like it's gone.
I couldn't find it
around this house anymore,
but we had all of these books
in like hardcover.
They were very beautifully designed
to the covers of them.
They were like sort of,
it was like this sort of
black background
with like,
just like one color scheme
going across the top.
Yeah,
and there's like sort of a graphic
in that stripe.
Yeah,
where the title is
and the title is like in gold
and then the one time
where they veer from that design
is in glorious appearing
when Jesus comes back
and it's white
instead of black.
Ah,
cool.
I mean,
that's really,
that's very clever design
and they were competing,
obviously,
with like anamorphs at the time,
which had incredible covers.
Yeah,
you got to draw the eye away
from the anamorphs
and the goosebumps.
What are you going to do?
At the Walmart book stand.
So,
this is the resolution then,
right?
Is that Chloe and Buck
are now an item.
We have checked that one off the list.
Yeah,
they go to the photo booth
and they take a silly one.
Yeah,
and they talk about cookies.
Sorry,
I'm still,
I'm still just picturing
a left behind cover
in the style of anamorphs
where it's just
Kirk Cameron standing
and then it's just him kneeling
and it's just the face
between him standing and kneeling.
I wanted to bring up one thing,
Josh,
because I do have a question
of if this is in the book or not.
Yeah.
Rayford sees a ghost?
Yeah,
he has a dream.
What the fuck is that about?
It does the vertigo effect on him.
He sees his dead wife.
She hands him a locket.
He wakes up,
so it's like it's not a real ghost,
it's just a dream ghost,
but then he has the locket
and that's it?
It's just like,
you think the locket's
going to come into play somehow,
right?
It kind of does.
I think in this finale,
he does use it to summon
whatever that angel is
in order to protect it.
Oh,
I didn't piece that together.
Everything to do with
non-corporeal beings,
the ghost of Rayford's
raptured wife,
as well as the other angel
question mark who shows up
later on,
none of that is in the book
and it's all pretty fucking confusing
the way that it's laid out
in the movie,
honestly.
They didn't need the angel,
they could have just,
you know,
had the guys breathe fire
on those guards.
She didn't have to freeze them.
Just because we're having
so much fun talking about
the excellent writing
of Jerry B. Jenkins.
Yeah.
You mentioned the cookie thing,
AJ.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That,
you know,
they go to the mall
and they do a little photo booth
and they eat cookies.
How nice.
Well,
the cookie thing
is an entire like subplot
in the book.
No,
it's not.
Where they like get cookies
and then Buck's like,
I'm going to eat my cookie
when you eat your cookie later
and then he eats it on TV
so that she can see.
What?
Oh,
this is a fetish thing.
This is a hundred percent
a fetish thing.
I would like you to read
the first portion
of the cookie scene,
please.
Okay.
No.
No.
Uh.
Oh,
oh,
we are already,
dear,
dear listener,
we are already off to the races
with this first sentence.
Buck ordered two cookies
in two bags.
That's the whole sentence.
Can't do that.
The teenager said,
then I want one cookie.
He said,
handing over the money
and slipping some to Cleo,
Chloe.
Yeah.
Chloe from five to seven.
And I want one cookie.
She said,
money in hand.
The teenager made a face.
Oh,
you got me again.
Bagged the cookies
for each of them
and made change.
Okay.
So I hate to interrupt
you right here,
but this is so clearly
another example
of Jerry B. Jenkins
specific thing,
right?
Okay.
Okay.
Oh,
these kids
at the fucking
Mrs. Fields cookies.
They never just give me
the order the way
that I want.
They always,
like,
he's so specifically
that guy,
right?
And he's writing
this into this scene
because Buck Williams
is the coolest guy.
I'm seeing him
just like melting down
in a mall food court
twice a week.
I want the chocolate chip.
I want the big one,
but I only want
half of it.
You can't sell,
don't sell me
the whole big one.
Just give me half of it.
Just give me half,
chew the other half
and spit it in my mouth.
Feed me like a mama bird.
I got it before.
I got this at the one
in Albuquerque.
You gotta do it here
too in Phoenix.
More than one way
to skin a cat,
Buck said,
I guess.
Uh,
they moseyed back
to the gate.
A few more passengers
had gathered
and the woman
at the counter
announced that their plane
had finally arrived.
Buck and Chloe
sat watching
as the arriving passengers
filed past,
looking tired.
I guess that's
the end of that paragraph.
Buck carefully folded
his cookie sack.
Ha ha ha.
Oh,
why is it a cookie sack?
Why is it a sack of cookies?
Uh,
and laid it in his carry-on bag.
How big was this sack?
I'll be on a plane
to New York
at eight tomorrow morning,
he said.
I'll have this with coffee
and think of you.
My man,
horny horny.
Okay,
hold on.
I'll be on a plane
to New York
at eight tomorrow morning.
Yeah.
I'll have this coffee
and think of you.
Yes.
That is his,
that is his,
that is his overture
to Chloe.
Right.
This is how Chloe responds.
That'll be seven o'clock
my time.
Ha ha ha.
Chloe said,
I'll still be in bed
anticipating my cookie
and dreaming of you.
Hey,
guys.
Hey.
Oh,
hey,
scrub daddy.
What's going on?
Hey,
Andrew.
Yeah,
what's up?
Oh,
hey,
what's going on?
Hi,
James.
Yeah.
Hey,
scrub daddy.
Not our names.
Do you,
do you ever,
um,
anticipate your cookie?
I try not to.
I spend all day,
every day,
anticipating my cookie,
scrub daddy.
I,
I,
I think about it
all the time.
And I can't wait for you
to clean the spoon
after I,
I like to get the cookie
and I like to.
What do you like to do
for the cookie,
scrub daddy?
I like to scrub.
Yeah,
it doesn't surprise me.
Just call,
just call me Eustace
because I like to scrub.
Thanks,
scrub daddy.
Do you want to hang out
for the rest of this
or do you want to,
uh,
I'd love to.
Thanks.
I'd prefer,
I'd prefer you not.
That's okay.
I shot him with a very quiet gun.
Oh,
okay.
Thank you for that,
Brian.
The gun from Riven,
actually.
It's a,
oh,
the quiet gun.
Well,
uh,
here's,
yeah,
so,
so Chloe,
Chloe is anticipating her cookie.
Yes.
Um,
we're still playing around the edges,
Buck thought.
Neither of us will say anything serious.
Buck loves edging.
Let's just be very,
yeah.
Buck,
Buck,
Gunnar King.
He's got his own cave
right next to Josh's.
In Ong's hat.
In Ong's hat,
yeah.
Uh,
oh,
wait till you're up then,
he said.
Tell me when you're gonna eat your cookie.
No.
Chloe studied the ceiling.
Hmm,
she mused.
When will you be in your most important,
most formal meeting?
Oh,
this is kinky.
It's so kinky.
This is.
It's kink.
Whoa.
Probably sometime late morning at a big hotel in New York.
Carpathia is coming.
Oh,
she,
I want you to.
For some joint.
I want you to.
I want.
Announcement.
I want you to eat your cookie
in front of the president of the world.
right?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
This is totally cookie.
Holy shit.
This is totally sex cookie.
She put it in her snatch.
This cookie time for sex me.
She put that up there.
Oh,
an announcement with Cardinal Matthews
and other religious lead,
and other religious leaders.
Whenever that is,
I'll eat my cookie,
Chloe said.
Oh my God.
And I dare you to eat yours then too.
You'll learn not to dare me.
Oh,
Buck smiled,
but he was only half kidding.
I know no fear.
Ha,
she said.
You're afraid of the parking garage here,
and you're not even the one walking through it alone.
Is that because of that car that exploded?
I think so.
Okay.
Buck reached for her cookie sack.
He's going to come on it.
What are you doing?
She said.
He's going to drizzle it.
We're not hungry,
remember?
Just smell this,
he said.
Fragrance is such a memory enhancer.
Oh my God.
He opened her cookie sack
and held it up to her face?
His face.
His face.
Oh,
to his face.
It's her cookie,
his face.
With his come on it.
He's got his cookie in her face.
Cookie dough,
chocolate,
nuts,
butter,
you name it.
He tilted it toward her,
and she leaned to sniff it.
I do love that smell,
she said.
Buck reached with his other hand
and cupped her cheek in his palm.
He didn't pull away,
but held his look.
Remember this moment,
he said.
I'll be thinking of you while I'm gone.
Me too,
she said.
Now close that bag.
That cookie has to stay fresh,
so the smell will remind me.
This is unbelievable,
Josh.
This is unreal,
Josh.
This is why I had to read
the fucking book.
Son of a bitch.
I don't care about all my feet.
This scene did not get adapted
to the movie,
by the way.
That's why I had to include it.
Is there kind of?
They like,
but not really.
It's just that they're like
in the mall
rather than at the airport,
and they're like,
oh,
here's a cookie.
I'll eat my cookie.
It's a reference for the heads.
It's a reference.
It's for everyone.
It's like,
you remember that cookie?
This had to have awakened
something in someone.
This is easily the most memorable
scene in the entire book.
I cannot.
Yeah.
You made this up.
You wrote this down.
You did this.
You typed this out.
I cannot believe it.
Jerry,
be you.
Jerry,
be you.
I cannot believe it.
Wow.
What,
what,
what has happened
in the other books
that we don't know?
Okay,
I've thrown out my idea
for the other rapture movies
we're going to watch
in the future.
We're just going to read
through this entire series.
That's what this podcast
is now.
We're doing one
left behind book a week,
and then,
then once we're done
with the left behind books,
it's over.
We're going,
we're going home,
so this is going to be done
by like summer.
It's Jerry's endless summer now.
I,
I,
I just,
I don't even,
I don't know what to do.
No,
like you're genuinely,
I don't know what to do.
I've seen,
I've seen,
I've seen what it is like,
oh,
did we lose Brian?
Oh no,
okay,
okay.
My,
my body is breaking down,
my nerves are falling apart.
Well,
I was about to say,
Brian,
like I've seen what it looks like for you
when you're like leaning into something
for the sake of the bit,
but this,
I can tell that this is genuinely
breaking your brain right now.
I cope with it.
Like,
I can't even like envisage a bit
that I can craft with this.
it's incredible.
It's so visceral.
Like,
how did they,
how did no one be like,
this is clearly about panties?
Like what?
it's,
it's,
it's,
they're,
they're,
they're Christians,
AJ.
They don't know.
They just think it's a weird long scene
about a cookie bag.
No,
they just love,
they just love the cookies.
They love the sugar,
the butter,
the flour.
Jerry knows.
Jerry clearly knows.
Wow.
Jerry probably does this with his wife,
but it's not with a cookie.
You know what I mean?
Yeah,
just fingering each other
in the Mrs. Fields.
I'm still waiting for my half cookie,
damn it.
Oh.
I've already finished twice.
That's what makes the batter so special.
Like,
where do we go from here?
I've got some more notes
about what happens in the movie,
but who fucking cares?
I know.
I'm sorry,
AJ.
Do you think,
you said,
you said what that makes the what so special?
The batter.
Yeah.
What are cookies baked from?
Batter?
Dough.
You're thinking of cake.
AJ.
Have you ever baked a cookie?
I have,
but they're usually just on the sheets.
Yeah.
Were they wet?
Were they dribbling through your fingers?
Every time I'm trying to break,
every time I try to bake cookies,
Kirk Cameron bursts into my kitchen
and starts jizzing.
So I want to just break down
a couple more points
of what happens in the movie
just so we can trace it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So we've already broken us down,
Josh.
You've broken us thoroughly.
I will bend,
but not break.
Yes.
That's what Jerry says at the cookie shop.
That's right,
Brian.
Rayford becomes Carpathia's pilot,
right?
Yes.
He is a new guy
who is flying
Global Community One
or whatever.
Yeah.
Not a bad plot beat,
actually.
Yeah,
well,
in the book.
It's kind of a bad plot beat
because,
again,
Carpathia's just really stupid
and he's hiring the entire
Tribulation Force to be his best friends.
Yeah,
and it doesn't really make a great deal
more sense in the book,
although I will say in the book
there is a sort of interesting beat
about how,
like,
basically Carpathia
takes Air Force One
from the President of the United States
as,
like,
a show of dominance.
Oh,
sure.
Oh,
interesting.
That man's name?
Gerald Fitzhugh.
Okay.
This sounds very Deus Ex,
actually.
It is a little Deus Ex,
which is,
I think,
why I like it.
If Carpathia knew
that it was the Tribulation Force
and was just like,
no,
you're going to do what I say anyway
because I'm such a good,
like,
speaker and I'm going to convert you
to my side.
You may think you're fighting against me,
but you don't want to.
But they make it.
And I think that's at least interesting,
but he's not good enough
at rhetoric to do that.
They make it so clear in the movie,
though,
that they're pulling one over on him.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That it's being done in secret.
That God is smarter than the devil.
And then it becomes like this debate about,
you know,
can you stop something bad
by joining the system
and changing it from within,
which is really strange.
Yeah,
well,
and there's a big piece of that
in the book,
too.
What I will say is that,
you know,
there's a plot issue here as well,
like a very obvious gaping plot hole.
Ding!
Which is that if Rayford became the pilot
for Nicolai Carpathia,
he could just 9-11 the plane
and kill the Antichrist.
He could kill him so easily.
Yeah.
Now,
of course,
you and I know,
Josh,
that killing him is only the beginning.
Right.
Right.
That's what happens with the book.
I think it's just called Assassin.
Yeah,
yeah,
right.
And there is an assassin
who kills Nicolai Carpathia
and then he returns.
Right.
As Nicolai Carpathia again
or as somebody else?
Yeah,
he rises again,
yeah.
But then he gets,
because the devil has possessed him,
as I recall.
Or maybe that happens later on.
Yeah,
it's because the serpent
in Revelation
heals the wounded head
of the beast from the sea
and so Nicolai rises once more
but he is now more powerful
than he ever was.
But basically,
Rayford...
This isn't even my final form.
Yeah,
exactly.
He gets more hit points.
Yeah.
But basically,
as Rayford
is now the pilot,
this gives him
unfettered access
to Nicolai Carpathia's,
you know,
personal effects.
Laptop.
Yeah.
And one of those things
is his PowerBook.
Yeah.
And basically,
Rayford Steele
busts out the world's
tiniest CD-ROM.
Tiniest CD-ROM?
Do you remember getting these?
These were totally a thing.
You'd get them at like car dealerships.
Yeah,
of course I remember
but here's the thing,
they don't fucking fit
into a slot loading tray.
No,
the tray is supposed to come out.
The PowerBook G4
is a slot loader.
This wouldn't work.
I see.
This wouldn't work.
This wouldn't work.
This made me so mad.
I thought this was
a GameCube game.
I thought he was playing
a total number
of the same size.
Those discs are the same size.
Yeah.
I'm going to play
Beautiful Joe on the plane.
Rayford has downloaded
onto the disc a speech
and this is a speech
from a man named
Rabbi Ben Zion
who is the number one
rabbi, I guess.
Oh, is he Ben Zion
in the books?
Yeah.
He's Ben Judah
in the movie.
I'm sorry.
His name is,
I think his name is
Zion Ben Judah.
I think that's his name.
Oh, okay.
Anyway, they wanted
to be as Jewish
about it as possible, right?
They were like,
what are some Jewish
sounding names?
So they hired
a goy Canadian.
Zion Ben Judah.
Perfect.
Christ.
No.
No, not at all.
No, not at all.
Not at all, Christ.
No, Christ.
And we'll get there.
Actually, that's the whole bit here,
right?
Is that this guy
being the number one rabbi
who every Jew in the world
listens to, I guess.
Yeah, he's the Pope of Jews.
He's the Jewish Pope.
Well, it's also,
if you remember,
the first Left Behind movie
had a guy named
Heim Rosenzweig.
Rosenzweig.
Who is in the book,
by the way,
of Tribulation Force.
He just doesn't show up
in the movie for some reason.
I think he does show up
in the new Tribulation Force movie
with Kevin Sorbo.
So Ben Judah is going to go on TV
and on TV,
he is going to reveal
who the real Messiah is.
And this is really,
really important
because of reasons.
Yes, yes.
It is a fundamental
misunderstanding of Judaism.
Yes.
And how rabbinical teachings
and studies work at all.
I mean, I think part of the reason
is that they're sort of setting it up
and this is more explicit in the book.
Yeah.
You have this archbishop
who has basically been promoted
to the new Pope
and the false Pope.
Yeah.
He has issued a decree.
He's issued one of those things
that the Pope does.
I don't know what they're called.
I'm not a fucking Catholic.
A bull.
Thank you.
And his papal bull
has basically said,
yeah,
Nicolai Carpathia is good,
actually,
and we should all follow him.
And so what they're doing here
is being like,
well,
what would the Jewish equivalent
of that be?
Well,
it would be the most guy.
It would be some guy
who is,
I guess,
the most esteemed
and most well-studied rabbi.
And what's weird is that,
like,
if you wanted to set it
in this sort of fantasy world
that,
like,
post-apocalypse,
every sect of Judaism
all came together
and,
like,
united and created,
that's one,
like,
way to go about it
world-building-wise.
But the way this presents it
is like,
oh,
no,
this is the way
it's always been for Judaism.
Yeah,
you know,
you would have to make
a mechanical effort
to do it,
but it's very clear
that Lahey and Jenkins
don't understand Judaism.
They have no idea
what they're talking about.
They see Judaism,
which is the case with,
I would say,
most evangelicals,
all these guys,
as basically pre-patch Christianity,
right?
That's exactly how they see it,
yes.
Because that's what it was
just JPEGs of boats.
They see Judaism
as being the same thing
that was being practiced
before the Roman occupation,
right?
And they see it as,
like,
this one singular unified thing.
They just don't have
a temple anymore,
but there's probably
a high priest somewhere,
right?
There's probably a Caiaphas.
We'll figure this out later.
High priest,
DK.
How much could a Judaism
cost,
Michael?
$10?
And a very important part
of dispensationalist theology
is that a certain number
of Jews have to convert,
right?
This is why,
if you remember
when we were talking
about Voice of the Martyrs,
how,
you know,
the creators of that group
were Jewish people
who had converted
to Christianity
because of the Anglican
mission to the Jews.
This is where this comes from.
It comes from Anglican
Christianity,
again,
and specifically,
like,
post-Cromwell Protestantism.
Again,
check out the episode
of Fruitless
that they just did
about the history
of all this stuff.
But, like,
this was a big project
that you have to convert
a certain number
of Jewish people
and or create
the state of Israel,
it turns out,
once we get to the 20th century,
to make the apocalypse occur.
And that number,
144,000.
The book specifically,
and it's not mentioned
in the movie,
but the book specifically
talks about this
over and over again
about how there are going
to be exactly
144,000,
like,
Jewish Christian evangelists
who form this remnant
in that it's going to be
their job
to go out there
and convert others.
And it's implied
that they are the only Jews
who are going to,
you know,
make it out.
Yeah.
And nobody else.
144,000 and nobody else.
I always liked
Jehovah's Witnesses
because they also believe
in the 144,000
in that there will be
144,000 people
exactly in heaven.
And somewhere along the line,
they did the math
and they were like,
oh, well,
that actually means
that no one else
is going to heaven now.
So we get the earth.
We get the earth.
There's some people
who are going to get heaven,
but the rest of us
are going to get the earth
at the end of it all.
So in the way that it works
then in the movie
is that rather than
getting super into the weeds
with all of this,
you know,
stuff that Tim LaHaye
thinks is literally true.
Yeah.
We just kind of go to Jerusalem.
But I'm curious to hear,
AJ,
how this all lands with you
because I'm assuming
this is all brand new information.
I mean,
pretty much.
I mean,
we discussed it a little bit,
I think,
in our first episode
and especially in the
Thief in the Night episode,
we got into like more
of the specifics of all this.
But, you know,
it just it feels like
it's so in the weeds
that like this movie
is trying desperately
to like appeal to non-Christians.
Yeah.
But they just can't help
but like eat their own assholes
because they have to get like
bogged down
in the minutiae
of this like numbering shit.
Yeah.
Which is, you know,
it's just not very accessible.
Like and also,
I don't know,
when you portray
the Middle East
as being a warehouse set
where there's like
a goat wandering around.
That's really funny.
Like it's not,
they don't even do like
the orange thing
that movies usually do
when you go to the Middle East
where everything is just
perpetually orange.
Like that new movie
about Mary,
like Mary the musical.
Yes.
I was going to ask you
the other day.
Journey to Bethlehem.
My favorite thing
is that the music
in this one too,
they do the microtonal
singing again.
But they've added
like a Yiddish
like fiddling to it
to like make it
so it's like,
oh no,
we just mean.
It sounds crazy, no?
Exactly.
But that's all they know.
That's all they fucking know.
It's microtonal music
and fiddles.
It was weird
during that one scene
when he was meeting
with a rabbi
and there was just a guy
in the background
who just screamed,
I have five daughters.
Yeah,
this was right before
Christians all got really
into Modest Yahoo.
So, you know,
a new left behind movie
should just be full
of bad reggae.
So, yes,
we have now heard
the microtonal
chromatic structure
so that's how we know
that we're in Jerusalem
along with the little,
of course,
subtitle that says Jerusalem.
Ben Judah
is going to be given
this dang speech
and Rayford and Buck
basically have a conversation
about what they need
to do
to fix things.
Because they have
instantaneously solved
the thing about like,
oh, the fire,
it's the witnesses.
They just come back
into the scene
and they're like,
that's what that is.
Right.
And so,
they realize
that these witnesses
have a utility.
Come on, Ray,
Ray, look,
the Messiah will be pierced
without breaking a bone.
We all know
that was Jesus Christ.
We all know.
He was stabbed
when he was hanging
on the cross.
Duh.
Ben Judah
was going to announce
that Jesus Christ
is the Messiah.
They changed the speech.
How are they going
to get Ben Judah
to read it?
Nikolai's got a lot
of people under his power.
We've got to get
to Ben Judah.
And then what?
I mean,
if he has all these people
under his power
or spell
or whatever you want
to call it,
it's supernatural.
What can you do?
I can't do anything,
but God can.
Oh.
The only thing
that's going to break it
is the power of God.
But how?
We get Ben Judah
face to face
with the word of God.
Fuck.
We take him
to the witnesses.
God, this is so boring.
I'm just listening
to this again now
and it's like,
God, like there's nothing here.
There's nothing.
The soundtrack
also doesn't help.
It's like,
it's implying
that there's stakes
where it's like
really trying to like up it.
But there's just,
there's nothing here.
They got to get
to the witnesses
and they got to like
not kiss.
Like that's,
that's the hardest thing
about the scene
is that they just can't kiss.
Dangerous thing
that they can do
in this story
is like have peace
and especially in Israel,
right?
Like for Christians
to believe
that their theology,
it's less about like
hastening on the apocalypse
and more about like
we have to keep proving
that our theology
is correct
by hook and by crook.
And so if there is
ever peace in Israel,
that is the worst possible thing
that there could ever be,
right?
We need this country
only to exist
in a constant state
of tension
that will eventually
lead to its own destruction.
That is how we construct society.
That is how we construct
the cosmology.
That is what God wants.
Right, right.
It is like
you were talking about
with the comfort article earlier.
Like these absolute whack jobs
are like losing their minds
over what's happening
over there right now
because they need
that death and destruction.
And that,
how can you build
a faith based on love
if you're actively rooting
for the deaths of others?
Like it's just,
it's fucking heinous.
Yeah.
It's so fucking gross.
I,
and this is the part of the movie
that I,
that really got me
I think the most angry.
Oh, did you get like head up?
Yeah, I did
because it was,
because it is just,
it's so like,
there's such a hubris to it, right?
This idea that like
if all the Christians left
that society would immediately
collapse in on itself.
Right.
And I don't know how to tell you this, bro.
The majority of the world
is fucking Christian.
Right?
It's not like,
like the world would be fine.
Yeah, China just goes chugging along.
Like,
no, no,
like things would be
pretty much the same.
And that,
the parts of the movie
where things are pretty much the same.
except for where it wouldn't, right?
Yeah.
I think that's an interesting piece too
that they don't really reckon with
in any meaningful way.
Yeah, America is the world.
Yeah.
America would have to be the world.
And like,
it also means that
there would basically be nobody left
in the Southeastern United States at all.
Parts of it would be,
would function pretty well.
Parts of it would be crippled,
but not because
the good people are gone,
but just because
there would be a very specific
and clear
and obvious population loss.
The piece about like,
well,
who can say what happened?
Like,
it would be so clear
right away what happened.
It would be so clear.
Yeah,
immediately.
And it's,
and it's also the thing that like,
it's why the leftovers,
I think is the best version
of the rapture
that will ever be written.
Until we watch a movie
that I will have us watch
at some point.
Okay, great.
But it is this thing
where it's just like,
it's just random people
and it's a very small percentage
of the population
that just vanishes.
And the world pretty much
carries on as is.
It's just that it's more about
like the interpersonal relationships
of like what happens
when a family breaks down
because like one member
of that family is gone.
What happens with a family
that doesn't lose anyone
in that world
and still breaks down
just because of like
the randomness of people
disappearing.
Well, and think about,
think about like COVID
and how many people have died
because of COVID-19.
Right.
Which statistically
is a small number,
right?
Like,
it's not that many people,
it has not,
although we did have
all this chaos
and supply lines and stuff
that was also because of ways
of addressing COVID.
But yeah,
no, you look at the number,
it's like it's a tenth of a percent.
What's that?
But like it does change things.
You know,
it's not that it changes
nothing emotionally.
It's that,
yeah,
it doesn't necessarily matter
to the larger scheme
of things
of how economies
keep rolling along,
but it does absolutely matter.
It does change something
about how you understand
the world
and how you see it.
It's amazing
that we were able
to weave COVID
into the story
more effectively
than the actual
Left Behind 2023 adaptation.
Are you saying
we might be more smart
than Kevin Sorbo?
I don't know.
I don't think so.
That's impossible.
He's read Brick.
Brick.
This whole thing
with like Ben Judah
and his proclamation,
this basically anchors
the back quarter
of the book
as well as the back third
of the film.
So they get to have
more debates with him?
Right.
Lots of debates.
But I do want to just play
a quick clip
of our introduction
to Ben Judah
because he's a little,
well, you know.
Excuse me.
Rabbi Ben Judah?
Yes.
Hi.
My name is Buck Williams.
I think the whole world
knows who you are.
Wait a second.
Oh.
Wait a second.
Buck Williams.
Rabbi Ben Judah?
A sheep in a dining area?
Yeah.
What is this?
I don't know what this is.
He prefers the company of men.
So we finally get to the witnesses,
right?
We get to the Wailing Wall.
Yeah.
The climax of this movie
is to get to the witnesses.
I have no clips of this
because this is purely visual.
You can't see it.
This is the best part of the movie.
By far and away.
In bad ways and good ways.
Yeah.
It's so fun to watch them
like breathe fire
and it's like obviously
fire coming out of
like a propane tank.
They also briefly stop time
by singing Amazing Grace.
Right.
And the guards start yelling,
stop riffing!
And like point their guns
at this angel woman.
This is the point
where you've got this
like angel question mark
that Rayford saw earlier
who then magically
shows back up
in Jerusalem
and sings Amazing Grace
to stop time.
This is like a classic
this is like a classic
guideposts
or chicken soup
for the soul story
where it's like,
oh yeah,
there was a guy
who was going to rob me
and then there was
this woman who showed up
and she started singing
Amazing Grace
and then he ran off
and it's like
and then that woman
disappeared.
I bet she was an angel.
They just do that.
You're actually doing
a really good Bradley Cooper
as Bernstein right now.
Instead of just doing
something from Revelation
where she walks up
to Rafer
and she's like,
eat this scroll.
She shoves it in his mouth.
And he's like,
oh, it's tasty.
And he's like,
oh, my tummy hurts.
This happens in the
book of Revelation,
by the way.
I'm not making this up.
And it's also one
of these things
where I was so bored
like watching this part
that my eye was like
just drawn to the background
a lot.
And what's so funny
is that when they freeze time,
all the guards are frozen,
but the candlelight
is just like flickering
around in the background.
So it is like,
it's like,
God, guys,
just they just froze the guys.
Slow down the video.
Come on.
They do slow down the video
when the guys get set on fire
and it looks awful.
It looks so bad.
In that case,
they were using frame duplication.
They were.
In fact,
what they should have done
was over crank the camera.
Exactly.
Thank you.
You're learning.
But yeah,
no,
they must have had like
about 15 seconds
of guys on fire
and then they decided
that these guys are on fire.
But just play it.
They didn't play
that much footage anyway.
No,
and they didn't play
the song either.
I wanted to hear
these guys are on fire.
So the witnesses
also speak in tongues,
not in the Pentecostal sense,
but in the Pentecostal sense
as an at Pentecost.
You like what I did there?
They speak every language
all at once.
Kirk Cameron films them,
but that doesn't matter.
They don't end up on TV.
Part of the broadcast
ends up on TV
and then Carpathia cuts it off.
This,
by the way,
if the stakes of this scene
feel confusing,
which they are.
Yeah.
Yes.
It actually,
this is a part in the book
where it makes
a little bit more sense,
but I think they thought
it would be less exciting,
which is that
Buck and,
Ben Judah basically
just go to the wall
and everybody is afraid to,
and there's a bunch of people there,
right?
Okay.
Okay.
But everybody's afraid
to walk up to them
because in the past,
people who walked up to them
have,
you know,
gotten fire breathed on them
and fucking died,
but they do walk up to them
and then they have this
like really special moment
and then later on,
there's a second scene
where they like sneak in
and talk to them
in the dead of night
or something.
Oh, twice.
Okay.
Yeah, twice.
I feel like it's not,
you're not doing a good job
as God's witness
if you're just breathing fire
on everybody.
You gotta tell somebody
what you're on about.
These guys are just fucking
setting people on fire.
They're not paying attention.
They're just causing trouble,
which is actually biblically true,
right?
They're just,
they're a menace.
They're all scamps.
They're a menace.
Yeah.
They're red on top of the mountain.
Just people keep coming up,
challenging them,
getting fire breathed on them.
The two witnesses are actually
the American Dennis the Menace
and the British Dennis the Menace.
I did want to take a moment here
as well to point up
the scene in the movie
where Buck and Rayford
actually before they go
and they see the two witnesses.
AJ, you had alluded to this
toward the beginning as well.
Right.
This was hands down
the most sexually charged scene
in the movie.
They pray together,
which is,
Kirk Cameron puts his hand
on Rayford's shoulder
and they have to pray,
but Josh,
you sent us a clip from this
from the book,
which is much more explicit.
Yeah, and what's interesting
is the one in the book
is actually a completely
different scene
and it's happening
in a completely different place.
It's everybody
rather than just Buck and Rayford.
But I think that, yes,
if one of you wants to read
this excerpt,
it captures the horniness
of prayer pretty well.
As Rayford knelt there,
he realized he needed
to surrender his will to God
again.
Apparently,
apparently this would be
a daily thing,
giving up the logical,
the personal,
the tight-fisted,
closely held stuff.
Rayford felt so small,
so inadequate before God
that he could not seem
to get low enough.
He crouched,
he squatted,
he tucked his chin
to his chest,
and yet he still felt proud,
exposed.
Hell yeah, dude.
Bruce had been praying aloud,
but he suddenly stopped
and Rayford heard him
weeping quietly.
A lump formed in his own throat.
I'll form a lump in your throat.
Come on.
Okay.
He missed his family.
But he was deeply grateful
for Chloe,
for his salvation,
for these friends.
Rayford knelt there
in front of his chair,
his hands covering his face,
praying silently.
Whatever God wanted
was what he wanted,
even if it made no sense
from a human standpoint.
The overwhelming sense
of unworthiness
seemed to crush him,
and he slipped to the floor
and lay prostrate
on the carpet.
A fleeting thought
of how ridiculous
he must look
assailed him,
but he quickly pushed it aside.
No one was watching,
no one cared,
and anyone who thought
the sophisticated airplane pilot
no one thinks airplane pilots
are sophisticated,
had taken leave of his senses
would have been right.
Rayford stretched
his long frame.
Let's go.
Flat on the floor.
Yes.
Hell yeah.
The backs of his hands
on the gritty carpet.
Face down asshole.
His face buried in his palms.
Occasionally,
one of the others
would pray aloud briefly,
and Rayford realized
that all of them
were now face down
on the floor.
What is this?
Byzantium?
It's much better
if you're vocal about it.
Yeah.
Rayford lost track
of the time,
knowing only vaguely
that minutes passed
with no one saying anything.
Oh.
He had never felt
so vividly
the presence of God.
So this was the feeling
of dwelling on holy ground.
What Moses must have felt
when God told him
to remove his shoes.
Rayford wished
he could sink lower
into the carpet,
cut a hole in the floor,
and hide from the purity
and infinite power of God.
He was not sure
how long he lay there
praying, listening.
After a while,
he heard Bruce get up
and take his seat,
humming a hymn.
Humming a hymn.
Humming a hymn.
We love humming a hymn.
Don't quote.
Humming a hymn.
Soon they all sang.
Hums for hymns.
Soon they all sang quietly
and returned to their chairs.
All were teary-eyed.
Finally, Bruce spoke.
We have experienced
something unusual,
he said.
We sure have, Bruce.
I don't know what to do with that,
but I wanted to throw it out there
and see what you guys thought.
Wait.
Humming a hymn?
Yeah.
Bruce.
What is this?
What is this?
That's what I've been asking
this whole time.
A prayer circle?
No, no.
It's not a circle.
It can't be a circle.
It's a prayer square.
How would they stretch out
their long frames
without bumping into each other?
That's a good point.
That is a good point.
I've been owned
by facts and logic.
They were all wearing
leather harnesses.
Oh, no!
Oh, boy!
There's a big-ass sign
in this thing
that just says triage.
I don't know
what that point was.
It's just a big sign
that says triage.
We have just decided
to wear something unusual
from international mail.
The church is also
a hospital in the movie,
but I don't know.
There's a firefighter.
Yeah.
Like, what did all
these firefighters do
that got them left behind?
There's a firefighter.
There's a guy
wearing a construction helmet.
There's a motorcycle cop.
It's the disco version
of pathologic.
The horniness
of that prayer scene
is something else,
and I feel like it...
I dig it.
I dig that.
It's pretty good.
I thought this was gonna be
horny between two men,
but no, this is about
the eroticism
of one's connection
with God
that I actually love.
Yeah, you gotta be agape.
You gotta really
agape yourself
before the Lord.
But, yeah, I don't know.
It does seem like
this just gets sublimated
into pure man-on-man action
in the movie.
Well, and this is something...
I think that this sort
of eroticism is something
that, like,
the author, playwright,
and screenwriter,
Sam Hunter,
understands, right?
Yes.
With his play,
The Harvest,
where he uses speaking
in tongues
in this sort of way,
and these very long scenes
that are all just in tongues.
There is a very important touch
that happens in this movie.
This was the one thing
that I really remembered
aside from the guys
breathing fire
from this film
from growing up.
AJ, I'm so sorry.
I did not warn you
about the time code of this,
but there is a jump scare
in this movie.
Kind of, yeah.
Were you frighted?
No.
Oh, boy.
I was so bored.
I was so bored.
That's the thing.
It's like, you can't...
You're the most susceptible
man to jump scares.
I am, but it was a very
poorly executed jump scare.
It is.
It's really bad.
I didn't remember
quite how bad it was.
I remembered the good parts.
Yeah.
So Rayford,
because he is saved,
even though Buck shakes his hand
earlier in the movie
and this doesn't happen,
whatever,
Rayford,
because he is saved,
shakes Nikolai Carpathia's hand
and sees him for what he is,
which is a guy with no eyes.
It's scary.
Ooh, scary.
And so we get this little
like reptile sounds,
like a...
His face flashes red
for some reason
and then his eyes disappear.
What it should be
is it briefly cuts to Rayford,
cuts back to Nikolai,
there's a sound going on
and his eyes are already gone
and his face is actively
hollowing in front of him.
Yeah.
It's like almost good.
They just needed
some little bit of discretion.
Yeah, there's also
no build up to it.
No.
You know,
there's no like strings
or anything.
It's just like,
pop,
and then it's done.
Well, that's part of what makes it,
what could make it work,
right,
is that there's just
no build up at all.
They're having this conversation.
There's a little,
there's supposed to be tension
from Rayford copying
that speech onto the CD,
which he doesn't finalize.
He doesn't finalize the disc.
It won't play on another device.
Anyway.
That's a good point.
Nothing about this disc makes sense.
But then he shakes that hand
and it comes out of nowhere
and it's like,
ah.
Ah,
and it got to me
when I was a kid
because I was a little bitch,
but.
Oh, sure.
But it's,
I mean,
that would be terrifying
to a child.
It's the Antichrist.
Yeah.
It's him.
It's very spoopy,
but it also is just like,
I feel like it also tips
its hand too much
because I,
I think there could be
a lot of fun
if maybe they're like,
well,
is Carpathia actually
the Antichrist
or is he not?
But as you said,
Josh,
they already blew that
in the last movie
where he shot two guys
in the fucking face.
And,
you know,
it's just,
it's so frustrating
from top to bottom
and plot wise,
things end.
Hold on,
hold on.
Top?
Bottom?
Yeah.
What is this?
I don't know.
What do you think,
Brian?
What do you think it is?
I have no idea,
Josh.
I'm sorry for interrupting you.
Because right,
after we meet the witnesses,
there are 15 minutes
left in the movie
and I was like,
what's gonna happen?
And it's just kind of over.
The answer is,
yeah,
Ben Judah becomes a Christian
and does his big
Pope of Jews speech
where he's like,
all the prophecies
in the Old Testament
were actually fulfilled by Jesus.
We've just been doing it wrong
for 2,000 years.
Sorry.
And this is written
in a way in the book
where it really,
it is fully the climax,
right?
And there's sort of like,
one of the most annoying things
about Jerry Jenkins'
writing style
is that he does quick cuts
where like,
it'll be like,
it'll just be like
a little bit of a scene
and then a little line,
like a line break
to let you know,
oh,
now we're somewhere else.
And so it's all these
different people
in all these different places
watching TV.
Yeah,
we're getting the Truman show,
basically.
It is.
It's the end of the Truman show.
That's exactly right.
And it's everybody like,
and it's Carpathia being like,
no!
You know,
and it's just a fucking,
anyway.
I love the part where Nikolai
starts to like,
yell at God at the end.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That was good.
He's like looking up
at the ceiling of his plane.
He's like,
this is not done.
This is not over!
I will get you!
The last piece of,
I guess,
the Ben Judah bit
that I wanted to point up
is once again
something from the book.
This is a little earlier
when Buck is trying
to own Ben Judah
with facts and logic.
In the long history
of Judaism,
Rabbi Ben Judah was saying,
there have been many evidences
of the clear hand of God.
More during Bible times,
of course,
but the protection of Israel
against all odds
in modern wars
is another example.
The destruction
of the Russian air force
leaving the Holy Land
unscathed
was plainly
an act of God.
Remember that bit
from the first book?
Buck turned
in the seat of the car.
I was here
when it happened!
I read your account,
Ben Judah said.
But by the same token,
Jews have learned
to be skeptical
of what appears
to be divine intervention
in their lives.
Those who know
the scriptures
know that while
Moses had the power
to turn a stick
into a snake,
so did Pharaoh's magicians.
They could also
imitate Moses'
turning water
into blood.
Daniel was not
the only dream interpreter
in the king's court.
I tell you this
only to explain
why these two preachers
are being looked upon
with such
suspicion.
Their acts
are mighty and terrible,
but their message
anathema
to the Jewish mind.
Actually,
he doesn't say anathema,
he says an anathema,
which,
oh my God,
come on!
They needed you
as an editor.
But they're talking
about the Messiah,
Buck said.
And they seem
to have the power
to back up their statements,
Ben Judah said.
And this is my favorite part.
But the idea of Jesus
having been the Jewish Messiah
is thousands of years old.
His very name
is as profane
to the Jew
as racial slurs
and epithets
are to other minorities.
That would explain
why when Carpathia
at the beginning
of the film
is like,
I will eradicate racism.
And you see Buck Williams
go,
no!
It's like,
every once in a while,
there's just like
this insane,
like,
that's so good.
And these corners
get rounded off
in the movie,
but it's like,
that's one of the most
anti-Semitic things
I've read in a bit.
Yeah.
First of all,
what?
What are you talking about,
Jerry B. Jenkins?
I can't even like
follow the steps of logic
that would get him
to that conclusion.
I can.
I can.
I just think
he hates Jews.
I mean,
it's what it sounds like.
He just hates Jews.
I can,
but it's so deeply steeped
in the mythology
of American evangelical
Protestantism
and it's incoherent
to those outside of it.
It can maybe sell someone
who's not an evangelical
Protestant
on the idea
if they've never
talked to a Jewish person
about Jewish theology
and this is their
first experience of it
and they think
that the author,
by nature of being a guy
who wrote a book,
knows what he's talking about.
But like,
this just doesn't fucking
make any goddamn sense.
It's the old trope
of the Jews killed Christ.
Yes.
But like,
Romans did.
But putting it now
into the mouth
of a Jewish character
but framing it
as like,
well,
this is what Jews were,
like,
it's got,
it's so many levels
of fucked up.
Yeah.
It's also the sort of thing
now where,
like,
I look at this
and I'm like,
I don't know where to put it.
I don't know where to put
any of this.
And it shows,
it shows who these people are.
It shows how the project
of philo-Semitism
in America,
especially,
is a deeply anti-Semitic one.
Right.
Is one that like,
that doesn't mean
every adherent
is anti-Semitic.
There are people who,
right,
but this is coming
from the people
who are leading the thought.
These are from the people
who are,
who are publishing
these books,
from the people
who are putting forward
the ideas that Jerry Falwell
was putting forward
about,
about the,
the,
the dual covenant,
right?
As long as Jews
keep maintaining
their original covenant,
which is,
no one does,
you know,
people aren't burning sheep.
Like,
Samaritans are,
and Samaritans are
violating other versions
of the Torah
by doing so.
This is a destructive,
destructive impulse.
And it comes from
a Christianity that,
the weird thing about this faith
is that anyone
who followed it
in the earliest days
believed that the world
would be ending
in their lifetimes.
Right.
Right.
So when that doesn't happen,
you have to create
a new tradition,
right?
This is not necessarily
based on scripture,
although it appears
in scripture as well.
This is about tradition.
All this stuff
is built on tradition,
right?
The canonical scripture
does not say that,
that Mary arrived
in Bethlehem on a donkey,
but tradition maintains
that she did.
Tradition changes then
because the world
does not end.
Every apostle dies
and the world continues on.
So you have to develop
newer and newer
and newer methods.
Of course,
once they get to the year
for like 1000,
they think,
oh, okay,
it's going to be
1000 years off,
1000 years on,
let's do some crusades,
right?
Then you get to Protestantism
and you're like,
oh, we know we need
to pave the way
for God on earth.
It has nothing to do
with Israel.
We have to do it
here in Europe.
We have to keep it going.
America,
this is part of the idea
of manifest destiny.
This is central
to Mormonism.
But then you get
to the 20th century,
deep into the 20th century,
and it still hasn't happened
and it still doesn't look
like it's going to happen
anytime soon.
They've formed the state
of Israel even
and it's still not going on.
So what are we supposed to do?
And it just becomes
even more flailing
and even more insane
and it floods back in
these big waves
of destruction
and it's a destructive impulse
that is entirely
antithetical
to the actual ideas
that Jesus is preaching
where he even says,
you will never know.
You don't know
when this is going to come.
You can't work
to make it come.
All you can do
is make yourself come,
I guess.
But all you can do
And save them
in an ice tray
for later.
All you can do
is sell your things,
work to follow me,
devote your life
to this,
to morality,
to the betterment
of people around you,
to the inner work
of salvation.
You cannot apply
this to destruction
and yet,
over and over and over,
it does get applied
to destructive ends.
Well, because that's
the only thing
that the project
is at its core,
right?
It is a project
that can only
define itself
in opposition to others.
It is not a project
that is fundamentally
promoting anything
for itself,
right?
Which is why we have
15 books of people
not actually doing anything.
Exactly!
Like,
the fact that this book
ends with
the number one rabbi
in the world,
I guess,
converting to Christianity
and, like,
thinking about, like,
all of the,
this is going back
to, like,
fucking thinking,
it made me think
about, like,
Merchant of Venice
and how at the end
of that play,
it's such a,
you know,
if you present it,
it's a happy ending
if you frame it
the way that
it probably was
originally intended,
honestly.
Yeah, right.
What you have
is this project
of cultural destruction
and cultural annihilation
that is framing itself
up as being
the way that we build
a beautiful future
together.
And it points
to destruction,
it points to
external destruction
at the hands
of an imagined
adversary, right?
Because that's all
it can do.
That's all the project
can do is imagine
adversaries because
of the fact that
it is in control.
Right, yeah.
The fact that
evangelical Christians
are in control of
and have been
for a long time,
at least ideologically
speaking,
in control of the
United States government.
The fact that they
have counterpoints
around the world
who may not be
evangelical Christians
themselves,
but are ultimately
enthralled to the
project of American
empire.
You can only
understand this
as a project
that can only
be relentlessly
acquisitive of
other people's
land, of other
people's faith,
of other people's
whatever it is.
And ironically,
that's what creates
the global community
in their imagination
where everybody
is unified.
They're mad that
things aren't going
to be unified
under them.
That's the problem.
Yeah, but Josh,
have you considered
that they're just
little guys?
Like when you're
attacking them,
you're just attacking
a little guy.
That's a good point.
That's a good point.
You know, when you're
attacking us,
which you shouldn't
do.
It's our birthday.
Be nice to me.
We're trapped in a
giant ball.
Yeah.
And if you want to
support us.
Moved again.
Oh, wow.
You know, one thing
that one thing that we
need because we're just
little guys is support
from you, our listeners.
And if you would like
to continue to support
us in what we do,
we have a Patreon.
It's patreon.com
slash worst of all.
And if you go there,
you can subscribe for
five dollars or even
ten dollars or even
twenty dollars a month.
And each of those
tiers give you
additional benefits,
rewards and so forth.
I had to make our
pitch because we
pretty much have hit
time now.
Yeah.
And I do.
I do want to, you
know, properly close
us out here.
Yeah, I do want to.
I do want to add
something to the pitch
for a second.
Go for it.
I just want to say we
have a big project that
we want to do this
year.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
And it's really only
going to be feasible if
we hit about a thousand
subscribers just in on
Patreon paid subscribers.
Paid subscribers.
So what we're working on
right now is we're trying
to build those numbers
up.
We're trying to get them
above a thousand and keep
them above a thousand.
And we're we're we're
pretty damn close.
We're so close.
And if it happens,
there will be some
stuff that we haven't
even quite figured out
logistically just yet.
But there will be some
real shenanigans and they
might involve a certain
let's say American state
that might have a spring
inside of it.
That's also named after
the state.
There might be that much.
We might be going to a
building that has its own
zip code.
Oh, interesting.
I'm not talking about the
Empire State Building.
So we've spent a lot of
today talking about this
horrible dog shit movie.
And it is also very
interesting.
And book.
And book.
And it is and it is
fascinating to me that this
is like the movie that
doesn't even have its own
Wikipedia page.
Like every other movie
that they have has its own
separate thing.
This one just redirects
you to the series because
it is so indicative of the
left behind series itself.
Right.
It is it is full of just
the worst of humanity.
Yeah.
And and its worst impulses.
It is full of anti-Semitism
and Kirk Cameron.
And the end of wait.
Oh, wait.
I'm sorry.
Hold on.
Anti-Semitism.
Hmm.
Kirk Cameron.
The end of the world.
Hmm.
What is this?
A left behind movie.
I'm the worst of all
possible AJs.
I'm the worst of all
possible Bryans.
And I'm the worst of all
possible Joshes.
See you next week.
All right.
