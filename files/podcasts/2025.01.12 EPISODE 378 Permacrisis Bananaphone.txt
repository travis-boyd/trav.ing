29.58 57.24 SPEAKER_09  Episode 378 Our first episode for 2025 I hope you had a good Christmas and New Year Although I will say obviously the Christmas period can be a tough time for some folks For a ton of different reasons And I want to be real with you at the top of the show I had a pretty rough Christmas First of all Viv of the show, my grandma Viv, had another minor stroke She's still with us Ben, it's all right I saw you're, it's all right
57.24 58.00 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, she's still with us
58.00 70.76 SPEAKER_09  And she bounced back pretty good the next day But it always shakes us up There's no joke about that It's just kind of the reality of being 94 years old, right?
72.20 90.40 SPEAKER_09  Yeah Then like in the main, we ended up buying a house in a big hurry In the lead up to Christmas and moving in like a week later And you know, like I'm one of the people that can be in the housing market So don't cry for me You know, it's tough out there for a lot of people
90.40 93.32 SPEAKER_03  I chose the least possible stressful time to do it too
93.32 97.84 SPEAKER_09  But that's right, yeah And it was like crazy disruptive, right?
97.90 142.68 SPEAKER_09  Like especially for the kids Their routines all went out the window And they watched a bunch of TV Since Caitlin and I were always busy like doing something or other And TV turns them into absolute cunts And it was like day three of me being yelled at every fucking waking hour And wanting to drive my car out of the garage and keep driving And our washing machine broke Because I didn't put the fucking moving bolts back in Because I'm a stupid piece of shit And I remember one night we cooked roast chicken and veggies And the kids had none of it And afterwards I'm looking at this butchered chicken on the, you know, on the wet shopping board And I'm going like, I have no idea how to do this I don't know how to clean this up I'm 38 years old
142.68 144.50 SPEAKER_05  I'm thinking I wish that was me Yeah
144.50 152.42 SPEAKER_09  Yeah, I wish someone had killed me Like I'm 38 years old And I can't work out how to get this chicken into a fucking Tupperware container, right?
152.64 157.70 SPEAKER_09  Just like completely like breaking down And I thought, no, you know what?
157.70 162.86 SPEAKER_09  Like you're 38 years old and you've been in therapy most of your adult life You can work this out, right?
162.90 190.18 SPEAKER_09  It's a simple thing So I opened my phone and I hit random album on Plex Amp And it came up with Effloress by Ocean Size And of course it was 7.30 at night So I'd already listened to Effloress once that day So I hit random again And it came up with this album I'm not trying to be funny, Andrew It came up with this album, The Shaming of the True by Kevin Gilbert Which about three people on earth have listened to And like, and Kevin Gilbert was this tragic figure, right?
190.66 210.50 SPEAKER_09  He was in a few bands in the 80s But then notably he was Cheryl Crow's boyfriend And member of the Epidemus Tuesday Night Music Club From her debut record And he co-wrote like a bunch of her songs He's got a writing credit on All I Want to Do And then when she went big She just left them all behind, right?
210.50 221.14 SPEAKER_09  And so he was like destitute for most of his life Right up until his death by accidental suicide in 1996 At the age of 29, right?
221.78 263.96 SPEAKER_09  At which time Genesis was looking to hire him As their replacement vocalist After Phil Collins left the band So like, he's a really tragic guy And Shaming of the True is a concept album About a guy who goes to Hollywood And makes it big And ends up completely hollowed out So it obviously like draws from a bunch of his experiences In Hollywood And it was put together after his death By his friend Nick DeVigilio Based on his demos and notes And you know, it's a bit naff But it's also like sad and beautiful And fun and really angry And when I listen to something like this I don't feel like sad or angry or whatever I don't just feel, I do feel sad, right?
264.06 278.96 SPEAKER_09  But I also feel more human and more connected Like this guy put it all out there And this is how he felt And you know, it's human to feel angry It's okay to feel worthless Because there's also kindness and beauty Coexisting within you, right?
279.10 284.50 SPEAKER_09  And remember, I'm standing in my kitchen Listening to this And suddenly I feel more alive, right?
284.56 302.20 SPEAKER_09  I feel like a real human And it's like a spell's been lifted from me Or at least for like half an hour And if there's any punchline to any of this It's that, you know, occasionally We get messages from people saying Oh, I was going through a really tough time And your show helped me laugh, right?
302.22 318.82 SPEAKER_09  And it's not many I'm not trying to blow smoke up our houses But it does happen from time to time And we don't intend the show To be completely nihilistic But it's like we do all these Batshit stories And sometimes it feels like we're insane Trying to make sense of it But it's the world that's sick It's not us, right?
318.84 354.04 SPEAKER_09  It's not you You're not sick It's the world that's sick And in some way I hope That the show helps you feel More human In some way I'm Theo And my big engorged spider belly Is ready to burst With tens of thousands Of little spider eggs And the pressure on my pussy Is almost unbearable I hate it But I sort of love it And I'm just aching for that release When all those little eggs Are going to slide out And fuck up my web With all my disgusting juices Oh!

534.66 574.88 SPEAKER_02  They refuse to learn from us Uh Now because we have covered this before I'm going to kind of do this as more of a A highlight reel Um Of just some of the The key Yeah The funniest of the funny That's right Yeah So first up Just a little bit of a preamble Um Just to sort of set the tone So this is some reports from just before New Year's First one here from Dutchnews.nl Firework sales start ahead of Dutch New Year frenzy Firework sales for the New Year festivities Began officially at midnight on Friday night One day earlier than normal Because they may not be sold on a Sunday Uh Sales normally run from December 29th to 31st In the Netherlands Like the Sabbath?
575.42 577.08 SPEAKER_09  You can't sell fireworks on the Sabbath?
577.40 580.50 SPEAKER_02  Yeah We can't buy fireworks on the Sabbath I guess It's kind of Yeah
580.50 584.08 SPEAKER_09  You need someone else to light the firework for you On the Sabbath as well
584.08 595.98 SPEAKER_02  That's right Uh The rules for fireworks have become tougher over the years Buyers are now required to buy safety glasses and fuses And cannot purchase more than 25 kilos of fireworks per person Fuck
595.98 609.62 SPEAKER_03  That's so much fireworks, dude That number needs to be lower Yeah Like two I wonder if they put like a wheelie bin outside the door Uh For people to just deposit the safety glasses in As they go back to their car
609.62 614.04 SPEAKER_02  Oh my god Yeah That's a Here You throw these out Situation for sure
614.04 625.94 SPEAKER_03  Yeah And then you You know Sort of every hour or two You can go out and bring them back in You know Bring them around You take the wheelie bin around to the back of the store And then you just Bring it up to the side of the counter And start handing them out again You know
625.94 632.10 SPEAKER_09  Yeah I'm just thinking of the state of the Medical waste bin at the hospital the day after Like that thing is
632.10 632.28 SPEAKER_06  Like a fingers
632.28 633.56 SPEAKER_09  Full of fingers
633.56 637.84 SPEAKER_02  Just a bin full of fingers Just full of fingers Yeah Little Dutch fingers Fat little Dutch fingers
637.84 643.86 SPEAKER_06  Fat little Dutch fingers Just Let's all just 25 kilos How many fireworks are you getting for that?
644.04 652.02 SPEAKER_03  Let's all picture for a second Going to a gym And picking up one of the 20 kilo plates What is a firework way you reckon?
652.38 652.84 SPEAKER_06  A kilo?
653.46 654.14 SPEAKER_06  Less than a kilo
654.14 657.72 SPEAKER_09  Yeah well I'm thinking about I'm thinking about a A roast chook right?
657.90 660.20 SPEAKER_09  That's like one and a half kilos Yeah
660.20 663.20 SPEAKER_03  Just depends on the provenance of the bird I suppose Yeah
663.20 666.62 SPEAKER_09  So imagine like 12 of those Worth of fireworks
666.62 670.48 SPEAKER_06  12 roast chooks Roast chickens Worth of fireworks
670.48 677.44 SPEAKER_03  Yeah In the back of a In the back of one of the What do Dutch people
677.44 680.32 SPEAKER_09  Quick Google What do Dutch people drive?
680.46 682.08 SPEAKER_09  I think it's in the basket of a bicycle
682.08 686.92 SPEAKER_03  No I'm thinking of the classic Red Rooster story we covered Oh absolutely But
686.92 689.18 SPEAKER_09  I feel like everyone gets that
689.18 691.00 SPEAKER_03  Yeah Thank God
691.00 698.84 SPEAKER_02  This is also the maximum weight of explosive Allowable in a private car So
698.84 702.44 SPEAKER_07  Yes they are putting it in the back of their Ford Festiva Yeah
702.44 712.84 SPEAKER_03  Let me just load up the boot Let me load up the boot of my Skoda Yeah With 25 kilograms And these fuses And I'll just leave the glasses here
712.84 715.02 SPEAKER_09  Hoping they don't combine themselves in the back When I go around a corner
715.02 726.04 SPEAKER_02  The type of fireworks which consumers are allowed to set off Has also been limited to types F1 and F2 Which means no Chinese firecrackers No Roman candles And no rockets
726.04 727.20 SPEAKER_06  Oh thank God
727.20 736.92 SPEAKER_02  Thank God Fireworks fans looking for more powerful explosives Head to Belgium Where the rules are not as strict See that's why they're heading to Belgium Yeah Just nipping over the border
736.92 738.00 SPEAKER_06  We're going to hit up Belgium New Year's
738.00 748.52 SPEAKER_02  I knew it I knew it I think Belgium is exporting its New Year's violence to the Netherlands They probably have like the safest one Yeah Because the Dutch people have taken all their fireworks
748.52 759.24 SPEAKER_03  This is like how Americans are scared of the cartel But the cartels are all using American weapons That have been smuggled in You know Yes Yeah It's just like that
759.24 792.96 SPEAKER_02  I've got a little bit more foreshadowing here This is from the NL Times People in the Netherlands Break record from 2022 For most money spent on fireworks People in the Netherlands Spent around 118 million euros on fireworks this year This was reported by the chairman of Belungen Veruniging Pyrotechnik Nederland The Pyrotechnik Association of the Netherlands This breaks the record of 2022 When fireworks importers and wholesalers Had a turnover of approximately 115 million euros According to the Trade Association
792.96 803.26 SPEAKER_03  I'd love to figure out How many euro 25 kilos of fireworks buys you And then we could figure out Like how many tons Of fireworks they've been through
803.26 809.02 SPEAKER_06  I think we're paying Dutch people too much Their wages are too high I think that's the issue We've got to cut that off Yeah
809.02 816.04 SPEAKER_02  Their society is actually too fair Their like income inequality is actually Equality is too good Yeah And they're spending it all on
816.04 853.42 SPEAKER_03  Too much excess money Disposable for fireworks I like the alternative idea though Which is that Dutch people are really tightening the belt year round They're like I know you need back to school supplies Little beyond But Yeah This is taking fireworks off the table Yeah Unfortunately You're going to have to You're going to have to reuse your pencils We'll re-lead those pencils for you Yeah You know You can get your hand-me-down pencil case And we're going to get the full I'll go and get 25 kilos And then your dad will go in separately And get another 25 kilos I'll go back in with a moustache on Yeah You go in there
853.42 855.24 SPEAKER_06  You go down to the shop and get some
855.24 864.28 SPEAKER_03  Your big brother is turning 18 this year So he can go and get 25 kilos You know We're going to be a 75 kilo family this year That's what I'm saying
864.28 934.68 SPEAKER_02  But I don't think this total includes The dark Belgian fireworks either Because this is just from the Netherlands Pyrotechnics Association So I figure they're probably spending another 200 million euros in Belgium It's great for Belgium Grunewald had already predicted That the total turnover would be higher Than in 2023 When around 105 million euros Was spent on fireworks This prediction looks like It will come true Quote It is a fantastic year For the fireworks sector Said Grunewald Good to keep that in mind When we get to Everything else that we're about to talk about Now So This is some reporting from New Year's Day From the day after the carnage This first bit from the NL Times New Year's Eve in the Netherlands Riots Acid and injuries across provinces New Year's Eve celebrations Across the Netherlands Turned chaotic As riots Arson and injuries Were reported in several provinces The unrest included The burning of a police car In Veen Firework explosions Causing severe injuries In Wognum Hospitalizations for Firework related injuries In children with alcohol Poisoning nationwide And widespread incidents Of violence And property damage In cities like Rotterdam, The Hague And Kulemburg
934.68 947.32 SPEAKER_03  Oh I love I love the purge Yeah All these drunk children Firing explosives Burning police cars
947.32 956.06 SPEAKER_02  In the village of Veen Located in the province of Nord Brabant The decades old tradition Of setting car wrecks ablaze Escalated into violence
956.06 960.84 SPEAKER_03  Yeah we'd hate to see Setting car wrecks on fire Getting out of control Become violent Yeah
960.84 969.52 SPEAKER_09  Also they seem Like surprised They lay it out Like a story Every single time And a story That they've never heard Before
969.52 970.18 SPEAKER_02  As if it's novel
970.18 971.70 SPEAKER_09  This is really like
971.70 981.98 SPEAKER_02  Dog bites man news Not like they're reciting A saga Like that they've been Passing down As an oral tradition Since the Chinese Oh like a cycle Like a grand cycle
981.98 982.64 SPEAKER_05  Yeah

1027.36 1032.06 SPEAKER_09  And just in the nick of time Too Sounds like I think the team said
1032.06 1033.74 SPEAKER_03  Tee hee hee While they were doing it
1033.74 1038.24 SPEAKER_09  Yeah And while they were getting Their bare ass Sprayed with water

1601.84 1609.72 SPEAKER_09  Just a large minority Of people are getting Their hands blasted off And shrapnel in their eyeballs What percentage of the population Died
1609.72 1612.14 SPEAKER_06  There's probably still Like 12 million
1612.14 1614.70 SPEAKER_02  Dutch people Left So they're fine
1614.70 1622.68 SPEAKER_06  You're saying they can Lose a few limbs If that's what they want This is their culture I think it's beautiful That's true We should respect Other cultures
1622.68 1641.86 SPEAKER_03  Is this the closest Analogy that we have To the purge In modern life Where we have like What is otherwise By all accounts A pretty A relatively Straight laced Culture And they Behave themselves All year And then they go Alright It's fucking savage Time to let loose
1641.86 1643.96 SPEAKER_06  Crazy time It's crazy hour
1643.96 1645.22 SPEAKER_03  Time to release the beast You know

1649.60 1650.48 SPEAKER_06  Yeah
1650.48 1653.44 SPEAKER_09  And we all do We all do
1653.44 1660.92 SPEAKER_06  We all do Australians just do it On like a minor level Like every weekend And I think that kind of Like levels it out A little bit
1660.92 1666.14 SPEAKER_09  And the Dutch Save it up And they have Three to four hours Of uninterrupted Psycho time Yeah
1666.14 1675.24 SPEAKER_03  We just Distribute Our violence And dysfunction On average Across the year In a normal way You know
1675.24 1677.50 SPEAKER_05  In total
1677.50 1688.94 SPEAKER_02  19 towns and cities Have been declared Firework free zones But the impact Has been limited For the card NL director Matajah Backer said
1688.94 1690.18 SPEAKER_03  It's my favourite Card of impact
1690.18 1704.10 SPEAKER_02  Definitely not right We have to ask Ourselves As a society If it is acceptable That every new year More than 1,000 people Including children Are injured And in some cases Scarred for life Meanwhile at the back Someone's yelling at
1704.10 1705.52 SPEAKER_09  Yes it is
1705.52 1708.56 SPEAKER_02  No The country has spoken Sit down
1708.56 1714.88 SPEAKER_03  I think I think the country Is answering you Very clearly On an annual basis I think collectively
1714.88 1716.00 SPEAKER_06  They're not gonna stop
1716.00 1730.52 SPEAKER_03  They love it Like extremely loud And clear You know Yeah Extremely loud Extremely loud And incredibly clear The right wing government
1730.52 1737.50 SPEAKER_02  Has already said It has no plans To introduce A nationwide Fireworks ban Great I mean They wouldn't Would they Yeah Good on them
1737.50 1750.50 SPEAKER_03  It's like 40% of the economy They are the They are the Seventh largest Importer of fireworks In the world Which When you consider What'd you say Ben About 20 million Population
1750.50 1754.36 SPEAKER_02  I think like 12 I think it's like Half the size of Australia I'm pretty sure Yeah
1754.36 1763.24 SPEAKER_03  So I feel like That kind of Puts their relationship To fireworks Somewhere in the realms Of like Australia's Relationship With poker machines
1763.24 1767.42 SPEAKER_06  Do you think There's like a Fireworks lobby That's like Making this happen
1767.42 1781.30 SPEAKER_03  I would be I would be shocked If there weren't Many many people Who made a Fuckload of money There out of it That's the fucking guy The guy that we heard from In like the second article This has been fantastic For the fireworks economy Grunewald

2434.96 2436.50 SPEAKER_09  Getting sucked off On a jet ski
2436.50 2436.94 SPEAKER_10  Yes
2436.94 2445.88 SPEAKER_03  Looking into my Beautiful children's eyes Or Thinking about The brand synergy Between Flavor Flav And Dukes mayonnaise
2445.88 2467.38 SPEAKER_02  Flavor Flav's debut As Dukes celebrity mascot Was revealed After the Minnesota Golden Gophers Won the 24-10 Won the game 24-10 Against Virginia Tech The excitement continued When Flavor Flav Was given the reins To perform The highly anticipated Mayo dump Pouring nearly five gallons Of Dukes mayonnaise On coach PJ Fleck To celebrate his team's victory
2467.38 2470.40 SPEAKER_06  What a vile waste Of mayonnaise Honestly
2470.40 2476.86 SPEAKER_03  Can I say though I don't think it's I don't think it's Uncut mayo I think they've Watered it down a little No I think it's mayo
2476.86 2478.04 SPEAKER_06  It's not five gallons I don't think it's
2478.04 2487.60 SPEAKER_03  Their premium stuff For sure No no I think if you were Really dumping out Five gallons Of Dukes It'd come out Like Like blobby It's thick right You know
2487.60 2491.54 SPEAKER_09  Yeah They've got to have Like a comically large Spoon to scoop it out
2491.54 2494.18 SPEAKER_06  That's funny No no no That's funny That's good
2494.18 2504.06 SPEAKER_03  That's a good twist On a classic formula That's a good game Yeah him sitting underneath While someone with a big spatula Like slapping the top of it Trying to get it out Almost there Almost there Alright Now we're talking
2504.06 2512.68 SPEAKER_02  Yeah Put in some hot water While it might seem like A questionable match There are lots of synergies Between Dukes and Flavor Flav Fuck
2512.68 2514.56 SPEAKER_04  Don't say that
2514.56 2516.92 SPEAKER_02  In your press release I hate
2516.92 2523.08 SPEAKER_03  These Yeah Don't say in the press release We know it's pretty iffy
2523.08 2532.88 SPEAKER_09  No they're leaning into it too hard I know that there was A punchline About spider pussy And stuff in the end there But I genuinely do think This world is sick Yeah But we're fine
2532.88 2536.04 SPEAKER_07  It's diseased We all agree on that Brands
2536.04 2536.44 SPEAKER_02  That's right
2536.44 2542.50 SPEAKER_07  Between Duke Mayonnaise And Flavor Flav I don't need to think that Nobody needs to think that Well that's okay I can see that
2542.50 2542.76 SPEAKER_02  Let's hear him out
2542.76 2543.38 SPEAKER_07  Let's hear him out
2543.38 2550.48 SPEAKER_02  Yeah they have some reasoning here He's an icon Whose name just happens To be Flavor Flav What do you mean just happens

3056.60 3077.72 SPEAKER_03  Can I offer An opposite direction To take here What we seem to be doing In my home Is Disconnecting from this kind of stuff And engaging in Like just Just enjoying And developing Like personal skills And doing I got I got Elna's loom
