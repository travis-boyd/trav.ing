0.00 22.94 SPEAKER_04  Hello, everybody. Welcome to the TF New Year special. That's right. It's special because it's the first episode we're recording in the new year.
23.18 23.46 SPEAKER_04  Bonus?
24.08 25.22 SPEAKER_04  And it's a bonus, yeah.
25.34 25.94 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, okay.
25.94 31.96 SPEAKER_03  A single piece of confessee falls from the ceiling at a very uncertain bonus.
32.48 33.36 SPEAKER_05  Happy New Year.
33.68 34.32 SPEAKER_05  Bonus.
34.58 41.22 SPEAKER_04  Welcome to the first bonus episode of the year. We've got a whole...
41.22 42.42 SPEAKER_04  The new year happens first.
42.42 43.78 SPEAKER_04  Do we? I mean, I guess so.
44.90 49.94 SPEAKER_04  We are showing a whole lot of content to you today through your ears.
50.14 50.66 SPEAKER_03  That's right.
50.66 54.38 SPEAKER_03  The first podcast to be distributed through OnlyFans as well as Patreon.
54.38 57.46 SPEAKER_03  We could not be the first if we actually did that.
57.58 57.88 SPEAKER_03  We would.
58.06 65.10 SPEAKER_04  Although, they are desperate for non-adult content, which means we could get such a good exclusive deal.
65.26 65.48 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
65.72 66.06 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
66.32 67.34 SPEAKER_04  Interesting. Okay.
67.68 69.62 SPEAKER_04  Rimming, sorry. Brimming with content.
70.62 73.28 SPEAKER_03  Okay, let's file that under business ideas.
73.62 84.06 SPEAKER_03  It just turns out that... Actually, I wouldn't be surprised if this is actually true, that OnlyFans has a more restrictive content policy that impinges on our bits more than Patreon does.
84.40 84.66 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
84.80 85.38 SPEAKER_04  It'd be like...
85.38 90.08 SPEAKER_04  It's weird that actually this comes under the fart ban, but apparently...
90.08 90.90 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
91.16 92.18 SPEAKER_04  Apparently, that's also...
92.18 93.58 SPEAKER_04  No, actually, what am I talking about?
93.68 97.94 SPEAKER_04  There's one of my load-bearing posts is about a fart on OnlyFans.
98.34 98.58 SPEAKER_04  What?
98.72 99.28 SPEAKER_04  Is this?
99.64 101.22 SPEAKER_04  Well, there was that whole...
101.22 102.88 SPEAKER_04  Over Christmas, there's a whole thing about...
102.88 106.08 SPEAKER_04  And yes, I'm aware that we missed a lot of news over Christmas.
106.20 107.28 SPEAKER_04  I have lots of it in the backlog.
107.46 107.90 SPEAKER_04  Don't worry.
107.96 108.74 SPEAKER_04  We'll get to it.
108.74 113.22 SPEAKER_04  But every so often, it'll be like, hey, what are your main posts that you like so much?
113.56 121.32 SPEAKER_04  And one of my favorites is an argument between a guy who runs an OnlyFans page where he says, check out my new OnlyFans page.
121.42 123.06 SPEAKER_04  I've just put a fart video on there.
123.06 124.80 SPEAKER_04  And then the guy...
124.80 127.92 SPEAKER_04  Someone replies to him that's like, hey, there's...
127.92 130.14 SPEAKER_04  I paid $3 and there's no fart.
131.36 133.40 SPEAKER_04  Just defrauded by...
133.40 139.40 SPEAKER_04  The guy says, no, you sign up to the OnlyFans, then you have to then pay to unlock the fart video.
139.56 143.90 SPEAKER_04  And it's the argument between the two of them about how much a fart should cost.
144.20 144.88 SPEAKER_04  That was...
144.88 147.02 SPEAKER_04  That sort of sticks that rattles around in my brain.
147.08 148.64 SPEAKER_04  And I sort of remember every once and again.
148.64 156.24 SPEAKER_05  It's very funny because like 50 years ago, that would have been a sketch about like, you know, that a guy saying, well, it's not worth a damn fart in a breeze.
156.40 160.04 SPEAKER_05  And then, but now it's actually people are seriously debating how much a fart is worth.
160.12 162.38 SPEAKER_05  They both agree it's worth a substantial amount of money.
162.64 163.66 SPEAKER_05  Because of inflation, obviously.
164.28 164.86 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
165.16 167.38 SPEAKER_05  Well, it's inflation, then rapid deflation.
167.50 170.98 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, inflating a big balloon with my farts and then selling that.
171.06 172.90 SPEAKER_05  Is that what quantitative easing is?
173.28 177.24 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, it's when they fart into the economy from the central bank.
177.24 178.66 SPEAKER_03  Flatulent easing.
178.90 181.64 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, sorry guys, I have to quantitatively ease for a second.
181.92 182.34 SPEAKER_05  My bad.
182.98 186.04 SPEAKER_05  In fact, Governor of the Bank of England confirms he's feeling much better.
188.62 190.46 SPEAKER_04  We're patting his stomach.
191.16 202.22 SPEAKER_05  We're now on like the Wall Street Journal podcast and it's like, well, you know, Biden's going to have to give the Fed a renny because they're going to be farting into the economy if he doesn't.
202.22 207.96 SPEAKER_03  It's just that the FT cover says something like a gastrically challenging year for China and then it's like a cover of like...
207.96 208.78 SPEAKER_03  The farting times, yeah.
208.94 209.12 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
211.20 214.36 SPEAKER_05  Since they eat so much pork, you're going to be gassy.
214.56 216.24 SPEAKER_03  I was thinking of The Economist as well.
216.44 217.98 SPEAKER_03  The Financial Times is a newspaper.
218.10 219.42 SPEAKER_03  It doesn't even have a cover like that.
219.48 220.08 SPEAKER_03  It has a front page.
220.08 225.62 SPEAKER_04  Anyway, we're going to get into some of the stuff from the end of the year.
226.04 229.86 SPEAKER_04  Starting soonest, we finally figured out what it takes for the terrorists to win.
230.26 234.06 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, it was the slightest amount of effort, it turns out.
234.90 242.10 SPEAKER_04  There have been two car-related attacks that happened in the States a couple days before recording this.
242.14 244.56 SPEAKER_03  Nobody actually knows whether they're linked or not.
244.56 247.74 SPEAKER_03  And to be honest, I could kind of buy that they aren't.
248.06 259.84 SPEAKER_03  Like, that there are two separate guys who like, by pure coincidence, hired like trucks to make car bombs off of the same app and then blew themselves up.
260.00 260.68 SPEAKER_03  Or like...
260.68 261.90 SPEAKER_03  Well, no, it wasn't even bombs, was it?
261.98 262.20 SPEAKER_03  Fuck.
262.34 264.94 SPEAKER_03  One of them was a car bomb and the other one was a guy ransomed people over, right?
265.04 265.26 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
265.82 269.50 SPEAKER_04  So there are two incidents, one in New Orleans, one in Las Vegas.
269.96 271.42 SPEAKER_04  The New Orleans one was like...
271.42 274.74 SPEAKER_04  There have been styles of this kind of attack that have happened sort of in recent years.
274.90 281.88 SPEAKER_03  It's like normal type crank shit to be like, you know, I am unsatisfied with my life.
281.98 288.30 SPEAKER_03  Therefore, I'm going to join ISIS and like commit suicide by terrorist attack or whatever.
288.80 294.18 SPEAKER_04  The one thing that links both these guys is they were in the military during the global war on terror era.
294.18 304.32 SPEAKER_04  What we know about the New Orleans guy so far is that, as you say, November, he's like, yeah, put an ISIS flag in his car, which again, could mean something, could mean nothing.
304.42 306.40 SPEAKER_03  Listen, I'm not a counterterrorism expert.
306.60 308.48 SPEAKER_03  That should be clear from the previous couple of minutes.
308.64 314.98 SPEAKER_03  However, surely, surely it would be easier to track the sale of ISIS flags.
315.82 320.38 SPEAKER_03  Like, okay, yeah, you track the sale of like explosives or whatever.
320.38 322.38 SPEAKER_03  But like, if someone's...
322.38 323.38 SPEAKER_03  Where are you getting an ISIS flag?
323.52 324.12 SPEAKER_03  Redbubble?
324.20 324.56 SPEAKER_03  I don't know.
324.80 336.32 SPEAKER_03  If someone's buying the ISIS flag off of Etsy or whatever, the hand-sewn Etsy-IS flag, surely that should trigger something somewhere with the like infinity billion counterterrorism budget, right?
336.42 336.98 SPEAKER_05  Because...
336.98 344.80 SPEAKER_05  Imagine the Marianne Williamson-ass woman who does the Etsy, like design your own flag, just like sewing the ISIS flag like relatively obliviously.
344.80 349.38 SPEAKER_04  Oh no, she's like, look, I made a promise to the buyer I would sew any flag.
349.56 351.70 SPEAKER_03  I mean, is there some kind of like, that's what I'm thinking.
351.80 360.76 SPEAKER_03  There's some kind of code of professional ethics for flag makers that's like, no, no, whatever you buy, we will sell you and we will not snitch, right?
360.86 369.52 SPEAKER_05  100% of ISIS flags on Etsy are sold to British journalists who are trying to prove a point about how you can get someone on Etsy to make you an ISIS flag but not an Israel flag.
369.66 374.46 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, and the other half being bought by FBI guys who are basically doing the same thing.
374.46 378.40 SPEAKER_03  What is the other like dual use of like an ISIS flag?
378.60 382.06 SPEAKER_03  Like, because nobody's doing like ISIS reenactments, right?
382.32 383.32 SPEAKER_04  Okay, all right.
383.38 383.76 SPEAKER_03  Oh, okay.
384.06 387.64 SPEAKER_04  Okay, but Society for Creative Anachronism, but it's like 2014.
388.02 392.26 SPEAKER_03  At the village fair with my AK and my mismatched camouflage in a Toyota Island.
392.86 395.62 SPEAKER_03  It's like, listen, you've got the World War II guys, what's wrong with this?
395.72 398.32 SPEAKER_03  It's about the history, it's not honoring it.
398.84 404.04 SPEAKER_05  Everyone always wants to be the ISIS guys, no one ever wants to be the Wagner Group or the YPG.
404.04 404.98 SPEAKER_05  Well, guess what?
405.20 407.52 SPEAKER_05  You need to have both sides to do the reenactment.
407.54 416.56 SPEAKER_04  In this case, if you want it to be really period accurate as well, you would like get an iPod shuffle with like the weekend MGMT's second album and be like, no, it's 2013.
416.96 417.60 SPEAKER_04  Pharrell Williams.
417.94 419.06 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, we're playing Happy.
419.80 420.46 SPEAKER_04  Come on.
420.52 430.68 SPEAKER_03  On a long enough timeline, there will be ISIS reenactors in the future who are going to be like perfectly normal, like suburban dads, who will have a use for the ISIS flag.
430.68 438.60 SPEAKER_03  But until that time, I just think that if you buy the ISIS flag, maybe the FBI should know about it.
438.72 440.54 SPEAKER_03  And it seems that they don't, you know?
440.90 443.28 SPEAKER_05  Now you're just some caliph that I used to know.
443.28 443.76 SPEAKER_03  Okay, yeah.
443.98 444.70 SPEAKER_03  Chances are.
444.70 446.00 SPEAKER_03  Chances are that they did, but they didn't do anything.
446.36 451.12 SPEAKER_03  Or they were like fucking like stringing the guy along and then he does the terrorist thing.
451.44 451.64 SPEAKER_03  Whatever.
451.64 460.64 SPEAKER_03  But like, if you just arrested everybody who bought an ISIS flag, you would get like a bunch of incipient terrorists and a couple of like ironic podcasters.
460.76 462.04 SPEAKER_03  And to me, I think that's worth it.
462.20 462.96 SPEAKER_04  It's a good trade.
463.08 463.24 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
463.34 469.22 SPEAKER_04  So the guys who are in God of Oz have both Global War on Terror veterans, both intel people.
469.22 493.64 SPEAKER_04  And I think the one thing you can know, really, or probably know, is that in the Global War on Terror, a huge number of people were sent overseas, made to do various kinds of like counter the coin fads, like counterinsurgency fads, more or less, and then dropped back into the States with PTSD and given very little support.
493.64 501.42 SPEAKER_04  And, you know, again, we created all of these, we created these guys overseas, and now they're back here.
501.70 502.40 SPEAKER_04  We're back here.
502.46 503.34 SPEAKER_04  They're back in the States.
503.44 506.08 SPEAKER_04  There are going to be some of them in Britain as well, presumably.
506.62 506.76 SPEAKER_04  Right?
506.80 509.62 SPEAKER_04  The only difference is the reverse of what Britain was doing with ISIS,
509.76 511.86 SPEAKER_05  which is creating them here and then sending them over there.
513.24 521.28 SPEAKER_04  And, you know, I imagine probably you're going to see more Global War on Terror veterans kind of do stuff like this.
521.28 524.58 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, I mean, it's not even necessarily about ISIS in that sense.
524.74 543.70 SPEAKER_03  Like, it may be, but like, I remember there was a guy who, the first guy to be killed by a police robot in the US was this guy in, I think, Dallas, who shot a bunch of cops and then like hold himself up in a building, and the police killed him by like strapping a brick of C4 to their bomb disposal robot, ironically.
544.80 545.28 SPEAKER_03  That guy...
546.06 547.10 SPEAKER_03  That's one way to dispose of it.
548.02 550.52 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, disposing of it by detonation.
550.52 553.64 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, what about a robot disposal robot?
555.14 565.06 SPEAKER_03  But that guy was like a veteran who had sort of like become radicalized online into a kind of like very idiosyncratic worldview.
565.20 571.42 SPEAKER_03  And it's like, okay, well, I'm just going to start shooting people and then, you know, presumably get killed.
571.42 581.62 SPEAKER_03  And I think you can kind of interrogate it as a, like a thing of like social fracture and like, you know, societal failure and stuff like that, right?
581.78 588.48 SPEAKER_03  Like, it's just a more dramatic, more homicidal way of committing suicide in a lot of cases, I think.
588.62 588.72 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
588.80 590.52 SPEAKER_03  Same as a lot of other mass shootings.
590.52 592.14 SPEAKER_04  And the other thing, right?
592.20 600.28 SPEAKER_04  You can link that to other trends, which is like, okay, well, the Ford F-150 every year gets like lethality grows like a fucking AR, essentially.
600.74 601.50 SPEAKER_04  It's like a Pokemon.
601.74 602.28 SPEAKER_04  It's evolving.
602.50 603.62 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, it gets...
603.62 610.96 SPEAKER_04  The truck bed gets more vestigial and the front of the car gets bigger and bigger until it just becomes like, you know, the child killer 6000.
610.96 625.24 SPEAKER_03  Not to polycrisis this, but this is a global thing because fairly recently, there was a pretty similar attack in Germany at a Christmas market where a guy in a BMW like a sedan did much the same thing.
625.24 625.68 SPEAKER_03  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
625.76 627.32 SPEAKER_03  Let's not come for those guys.
627.66 628.90 SPEAKER_03  Arrest every BMW driver.
629.16 630.96 SPEAKER_03  But this guy was like...
630.96 632.62 SPEAKER_03  Lock him up with the ISIS flag, guys.
632.64 640.44 SPEAKER_03  There was this whiplash effect where people were like, oh, it's, you know, because of mass immigration and because of like, this guy is clearly an Islamist.
640.44 646.72 SPEAKER_03  And then they found his Twitter account and he was an ex-Muslim, like big AFD, far right guy.
647.14 649.52 SPEAKER_03  So it really is just like...
649.52 655.96 SPEAKER_04  You could even say the same thing about like, again, if you look at the, a lot of people after like the Brian Thompson shooting, right?
656.02 660.50 SPEAKER_04  We're like, okay, well, Luigi Mangione must be exactly the right kind of communist as I am.
660.52 664.10 SPEAKER_04  And then you're like, oh no, he's like a Tim Urban, less wrong guy.
664.26 664.46 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
664.64 669.80 SPEAKER_03  It's just, it turns out that in any case, just the kind of...
669.80 683.40 SPEAKER_03  People are doing like, you know, assessing out to commit violence and feel like uninhibited to do that because of some of the weirdest individual politics you can possibly imagine.
683.58 683.68 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
683.96 684.18 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
684.36 694.78 SPEAKER_04  And it just so happens that like 50% of them or more as a representative sample were created in the United States' imperial adventures.
695.58 697.34 SPEAKER_05  Which is like always the way, right?
697.38 702.78 SPEAKER_05  Unless you're like involved in some kind of like organized resistance program that's branded as terrorism.
702.94 703.28 SPEAKER_05  I don't know.
703.32 713.52 SPEAKER_05  You're in a group like fucking the YPG or something where like you're, you're like doing a thing where it's kind of like people who are like, well, I need to be do this because otherwise they'll wipe us from the face of the earth kind of thing.
713.52 718.02 SPEAKER_05  If you're like an American guy who becomes a terrorist, you're going to be a lunatic.
718.26 720.60 SPEAKER_05  You're not going to, you're not going to be doing it for like reason.
721.08 723.48 SPEAKER_05  Like there's no, there's no path there.
723.60 725.64 SPEAKER_05  There's no necessity to become a terrorist.
725.76 727.06 SPEAKER_05  So you would just have to be a nutcase.
727.08 729.52 SPEAKER_03  It's kind of a victim of your own success thing, right?
729.56 743.84 SPEAKER_03  And that if you make it impossible to like have a terrorist organization in the US that isn't like mostly federal informants, then all you're left with are the people who like self-radicalize off of like posts effectively.
744.08 746.20 SPEAKER_05  They've got a Potemkin terrorist industry.
746.24 747.00 SPEAKER_03  It's all state fun.
747.08 748.14 SPEAKER_03  It's protectionism.
748.28 749.80 SPEAKER_03  We used to have that.
750.22 754.02 SPEAKER_03  Big government stifling innovation in the private sector once again.
754.38 754.54 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
754.62 757.64 SPEAKER_04  It's what if you're, again, this is where I sort of always look to.
757.78 761.72 SPEAKER_04  I always look to the empire to find questions as to what's happening in the metropole.
761.72 764.94 SPEAKER_03  You have to have a startup mentality all the time.
765.28 768.40 SPEAKER_03  We only have to have a startup mentality once.
770.08 773.48 SPEAKER_04  In Soviet Union, everyone is civil servant, even terrorists.
774.64 778.24 SPEAKER_04  But you look to the empire to understand what's going on in the metropole, right?
778.32 778.62 SPEAKER_04  This happens.
778.70 788.82 SPEAKER_04  This counts for Britain as well, which is, you know, there is the gigantic web of surveillance, you know, that got created to manage the empire.
788.82 793.30 SPEAKER_04  There are a lot of it, again, like road tested in places like Iraq and Afghanistan, right?
793.36 799.58 SPEAKER_04  Of just going into and disrupting and inserting yourself at all level of like community organization directed towards your end.
799.92 803.24 SPEAKER_04  You know, that approach to, you know, population management.
803.60 812.80 SPEAKER_04  That's, you know, that also is going to make it basically mean that people who are, yeah, people are going to go off on a mad one individually.
812.80 817.76 SPEAKER_04  And, you know, I mean, but in a way that's not legendary at all.
817.84 830.24 SPEAKER_03  Part of the thing that's so bleak about the New Orleans attack, right, is because of how much of the city's economy is dependent on tourism, how quick everybody involved in like city government was and state government to go.
830.62 832.88 SPEAKER_03  Everybody who died pretty much was like local.
833.06 834.08 SPEAKER_03  So it's safe for tourists.
834.08 842.40 SPEAKER_03  And because New Orleans is about to have the Super Bowl, they have another big football game, which they postponed by one day in order to, you know.
842.42 842.60 SPEAKER_03  Terrorists win.
843.40 843.94 SPEAKER_03  Terrorists win.
844.08 844.22 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
844.40 847.10 SPEAKER_03  You know, it changed our lifestyle.
847.28 848.44 SPEAKER_03  We put the Sugar Bowl back one day.
848.50 849.70 SPEAKER_03  So terrorism won.
850.10 852.16 SPEAKER_05  Well, that guy was going to be the halftime show act.
852.24 853.30 SPEAKER_05  So they had to book someone else.
853.30 859.46 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, but the lesson is, I guess, that like you can see pretty clearly what the priorities are there, right?
859.50 862.36 SPEAKER_03  Which is to keep bringing tourism in and keep taking their money.
862.44 866.62 SPEAKER_03  And there is almost nothing that will be allowed to stop the Super Bowl.
866.88 870.98 SPEAKER_03  Like Bane could be collapsing the field like fucking Dark Knight Rises.
871.26 873.24 SPEAKER_03  And they would still be like, no, it's safe.
873.30 874.00 SPEAKER_03  Don't worry about it.
874.32 876.52 SPEAKER_03  They expect one of us in the Cybertruck, brother.
876.74 879.60 SPEAKER_04  Well, so on the Cybertruck, which I think is also another.
879.60 886.80 SPEAKER_04  So the Cybertruck bomb, which was largely fireworks and gasoline, which is like, okay, if there's fuckery.
886.92 889.10 SPEAKER_03  Neither of those is a very good bomb.
889.50 890.10 SPEAKER_03  That's famously.
890.54 892.38 SPEAKER_05  When I heard this, I was like, this guy's an amateur.
892.50 893.86 SPEAKER_05  Then I heard he did it in a Cybertruck.
893.92 895.92 SPEAKER_05  And I was like, oh, no, he was planning for a big explosion.
896.38 897.34 SPEAKER_04  He's the one who was.
897.50 901.46 SPEAKER_04  So here's where I'm going to sort of put one corner of tinfoil on my head.
901.54 901.76 SPEAKER_04  Okay.
901.94 905.16 SPEAKER_04  Which is that he's the one who was this guy, Matthew Livelsberger.
905.62 910.80 SPEAKER_04  He's the one who was in Special Forces for a longer time, which means he's the one who's got the connections to like the U.S.
910.86 916.00 SPEAKER_04  Army Special Forces crime family, which basically uses Fort Bragg as a meth import point.
916.22 921.72 SPEAKER_03  On the other hand, to be a Green Beret, you do have to be like certifiable, to be clear.
922.02 924.20 SPEAKER_03  So there's always that overlap, right?
924.22 935.90 SPEAKER_03  If like these are guys who on the one hand love trafficking drugs and on the other hand love believing that like the federal government is going to like hunt them all down and vaccinate them.
935.90 936.38 SPEAKER_04  Yes.
936.80 948.60 SPEAKER_04  So and so I think the cockamamie way in which the rented Cybertruck went up in front of Trump Tower, the fireworks and fucking gasoline bomb in the Cybertruck.
948.68 956.12 SPEAKER_03  It probably sounds good as hell to like die in a fireworks explosion when you're on as many steroids as like an ex-Special Forces guy must have been.
956.34 956.52 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
956.84 959.68 SPEAKER_05  Although not when you're that afraid of fireworks, I can imagine.
960.02 962.54 SPEAKER_03  It's sort of like aversion therapy.
962.54 965.36 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, exposure therapy for like my fireworks.
966.24 966.42 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
967.12 968.80 SPEAKER_05  Strapping him to a Catherine wheel.
968.80 980.48 SPEAKER_04  I think Matthew Liversberger like achieved the ultimate ecstasy that only special forces guys get, which is dying in a fireworks explosion outside of Trump Tower.
980.88 985.76 SPEAKER_03  I just picture that like flashing forward to them like engraving that on the tombstone.
985.98 987.30 SPEAKER_03  You know, how did this guy die?
987.70 990.86 SPEAKER_03  Fireworks explosion in Cybertruck outside Trump lobby.
990.86 993.78 SPEAKER_03  My other favorite thing about this was Eric Trump.
994.00 994.84 SPEAKER_03  They put out there.
995.00 999.88 SPEAKER_03  They made Eric put out the statement for this, which in itself is a kind of succession plot line.
1000.10 1014.00 SPEAKER_03  But Eric Trump or his intern or whatever tweeted about how there was an explosion in the port cocher of like Trump, you know, the Trump hotel.
1014.00 1014.44 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1014.82 1023.70 SPEAKER_03  And I've been thinking about Eric Trump saying the words port cocher for about like 20 hours.
1023.70 1025.64 SPEAKER_05  I've never heard that phrase before ever.
1025.86 1026.64 SPEAKER_05  And you won't again.
1027.06 1027.34 SPEAKER_05  No.
1027.78 1029.78 SPEAKER_05  It's like he made up a new word.
1029.78 1035.74 SPEAKER_04  Look, I think my tinfoil here is that I think the guy who died in the port cocher.
1036.50 1038.24 SPEAKER_03  You would hate to die in a port cocher.
1038.24 1039.34 SPEAKER_03  New Cluedo is weird.
1039.34 1043.10 SPEAKER_03  That's a Barry Linden-ass death location, to be clear.
1043.72 1048.10 SPEAKER_05  The green beret in the port cocher with the gasoline and fireworks Cybertruck.
1048.56 1051.84 SPEAKER_05  I mean, I think I knew you could put gasoline in a Cybertruck.
1052.00 1052.14 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1052.30 1052.58 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1052.62 1053.66 SPEAKER_03  Happy New Year, everyone.
1053.82 1057.10 SPEAKER_03  2025, the year of total incoherence.
1057.10 1059.12 SPEAKER_03  And it's only going to get worse from here.
1059.48 1059.74 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1060.04 1068.44 SPEAKER_04  If there was ever like someone who's taking a fall for like a bunch of other green berets, like, you know, meth business or whatever.
1068.44 1069.84 SPEAKER_04  And they were like, fuck it.
1069.90 1071.24 SPEAKER_04  Put his body in the Cybertruck.
1071.50 1073.16 SPEAKER_04  Get some gasoline and fireworks.
1073.28 1073.46 SPEAKER_04  It'll go up.
1073.46 1077.28 SPEAKER_03  You're just thinking this is a season premiere of Reacher type beat here, Ben.
1077.82 1083.44 SPEAKER_04  Look, this is what I think now I'm willing for the, I'm willing for the, for information to change.
1083.52 1089.22 SPEAKER_05  It would be fun if he was just trying to take a load of gasoline and fireworks for his stay at Trump Tower and then the Cybertruck just did that.
1089.80 1090.48 SPEAKER_03  And now.
1090.48 1092.38 SPEAKER_03  I will say this.
1092.72 1101.72 SPEAKER_03  The photos of the burning Cybertruck outside the Trump port, Cocher, I can't still say it now, are admittedly like very aesthetic and that's cool.
1102.00 1111.92 SPEAKER_03  Also, Elon Musk said he like took credit for how the Cybertruck like contained the explosion in his words.
1113.92 1124.20 SPEAKER_03  Which, yeah, well, it, yeah, it's like a reverse MRAP, you know, like it's a, it's a sort of like you are protected from the driver of the Cybertruck in one way only.
1124.34 1127.06 SPEAKER_03  And that's if he detonates a bunch of fireworks.
1127.06 1131.96 SPEAKER_05  I've gone Jamie and pulled these photos up and they are very aesthetic, I agree.
1132.06 1137.50 SPEAKER_04  Also, the, the doors locked when the fire started, which is such a cool safety feature.
1137.68 1139.16 SPEAKER_04  They, ah, I see there's a fire in your car.
1139.22 1139.98 SPEAKER_03  You want to stay in it?
1139.98 1155.90 SPEAKER_03  If the Cybertruck thwarted like a marauding terrorist attack like the New Orleans one by locking the guy in with his own fireworks bomb, I will give Elon Musk one scintilla of credit for that by accident, because I think that's very funny.
1155.90 1157.74 SPEAKER_04  The car that is also a jail.
1157.88 1169.38 SPEAKER_04  So, anyway, what I'm reminded of also is like, this is how many like sort of fucked up and probably unexplainable mass or attempted mass casualty events have happened in Vegas in the last couple of years.
1169.38 1176.76 SPEAKER_03  We still don't know why the guy who shot up the country music festival shot up the country music festival because he just destroyed all his hard drives right before he did.
1177.10 1185.86 SPEAKER_03  And I like, this is the thing you can get parapolitics about this and you can be like, oh, this guy was like a fucking, you know, MK ultra Manchurian candidate or whatever the fuck.
1185.90 1188.60 SPEAKER_03  But I don't think it needs to be that deep for any of this stuff.
1188.68 1197.60 SPEAKER_03  I think people are just like, there's enough people willing to like commit murder suicides in the strangest possible ways in that country.
1197.82 1198.74 SPEAKER_03  And indeed in this country.
1198.76 1200.12 SPEAKER_05  If Scandinavia has taught us anything.
1200.12 1200.26 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
1200.32 1200.52 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
1200.62 1203.18 SPEAKER_04  So, I want to move on though.
1203.50 1204.38 SPEAKER_04  I want to move on.
1204.52 1205.54 SPEAKER_04  Which is, of course.
1205.58 1208.62 SPEAKER_03  That's also what the guy said right before, you know, the doors wouldn't open.
1209.04 1213.32 SPEAKER_04  We have learned actually what the problem is in America.
1213.32 1213.82 SPEAKER_06  Hmm.
1214.18 1216.38 SPEAKER_04  And I'm going to Britain soon.
1216.46 1216.72 SPEAKER_04  Don't worry.
1217.06 1218.04 SPEAKER_04  Insufficient bollards.
1218.44 1219.76 SPEAKER_04  They need more bollards.
1220.08 1224.92 SPEAKER_04  We've learned that the problem is, and this is back to our friends in Silicon Valley.
1225.48 1233.32 SPEAKER_04  There's, wouldn't you know it, there has been something of a so far rhetorical rift between the Elon Musks and the Steve Bannons.
1233.32 1244.68 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, this was the funniest shit in the world for a minute on Twitter was Elon Musk getting in a fight with all of the like Nazis that he brought onto the platform.
1245.34 1255.18 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, getting, I mean, getting into a fight with like, with Laura Loomer, Donald Trump's most banned girlfriend, is one of the funniest things.
1255.18 1258.16 SPEAKER_03  Is she going to handcuff herself to the doors of Twitter again?
1258.82 1258.90 SPEAKER_05  Just.
1259.26 1262.10 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, a second time, a different administration.
1262.10 1265.86 SPEAKER_05  She just picks the other door, but she still doesn't get both of them.
1266.34 1266.54 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1266.98 1277.42 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, but that basically the, one of the, one of the, one of the things about the tech industry that we know, because we talk about it so much, is that they are hugely reliant wherever they are.
1277.50 1284.14 SPEAKER_04  They tend to be hugely reliant on outsourcing a lot of training to India via like the Indian Institutes of Technology.
1284.74 1285.18 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1285.18 1290.06 SPEAKER_03  But also just like, it's a, it's a way to sort of depress wages, right?
1290.06 1300.10 SPEAKER_03  Is you, you bring someone to the US or the UK on a kind of like employment visa who is, is then dependent on you and you can pay them next to nothing.
1300.10 1301.16 SPEAKER_03  And they do routinely.
1301.66 1301.68 SPEAKER_03  Like.
1302.04 1302.16 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1302.16 1307.02 SPEAKER_04  And so of course these things don't always line up and in political coalitions, right?
1307.06 1318.46 SPEAKER_04  A huge part of coalition building is building bridges, but it all culminated in what I think is probably one of the, I'll come out and say it, a federalist papers for 2024, for 2024 and five.
1318.50 1318.78 SPEAKER_04  Uh-huh.
1319.18 1324.70 SPEAKER_04  Vivek Ramaswamy's opinions on why the H1B visa program is necessary.
1324.70 1330.12 SPEAKER_03  He did a long Twitter thread, uh, that was a functionally like Indian.
1330.12 1330.52 SPEAKER_03  Don't worry.
1330.76 1331.10 SPEAKER_03  Sorry.
1331.16 1331.60 SPEAKER_03  I've got it.
1331.64 1331.84 SPEAKER_03  Okay.
1331.92 1332.32 SPEAKER_03  You've got it.
1332.32 1333.98 SPEAKER_03  White people don't want to work anymore.
1333.98 1334.98 SPEAKER_03  Basically, yes.
1335.38 1335.62 SPEAKER_04  Yes.
1336.08 1340.90 SPEAKER_04  You're not, and Conceive forgot that with conservatism, you're not supposed to say that.
1341.38 1342.64 SPEAKER_04  That's for the out group.
1343.70 1343.82 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
1344.54 1348.26 SPEAKER_04  Like, uh, white professionals are not, they're not supposed to be the out group yet.
1348.66 1351.24 SPEAKER_04  You're accelerating the program too much, Vivek.
1351.24 1364.70 SPEAKER_04  Uh, I mean, I mean, Vivek himself, we've talked about him quite a bit before, but also to have like the guy who's rich because he lied about having an Alzheimer's cure and then just kept the money from that.
1365.06 1366.62 SPEAKER_04  Is that legal to do?
1367.62 1369.66 SPEAKER_05  What if the Theranos woman had swag?
1369.82 1370.42 SPEAKER_04  A little bit.
1370.46 1370.72 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1370.92 1374.84 SPEAKER_04  Like his, no, he, he was a biotech entrepreneur, but none of his companies ever did anything.
1374.84 1378.42 SPEAKER_04  Like he, he would go on the news and be like, oh, you were close to developing an Alzheimer's cure.
1378.42 1379.72 SPEAKER_04  And then, you know, did it work?
1379.82 1380.08 SPEAKER_04  No.
1380.08 1381.14 SPEAKER_04  But is he rich?
1381.30 1381.44 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1381.62 1384.82 SPEAKER_03  Is it illegal to be close to developing an Alzheimer's cure?
1384.98 1385.92 SPEAKER_03  It's like, I'm...
1385.92 1386.20 SPEAKER_03  Absolutely not.
1386.86 1387.90 SPEAKER_03  Define close.
1388.00 1390.04 SPEAKER_03  Well, I had an Alzheimer's cure, but I forgot it.
1390.74 1392.72 SPEAKER_03  I just had the most magical dream.
1392.84 1393.94 SPEAKER_04  Give me $50 billion.
1394.88 1403.68 SPEAKER_04  Uh, the reason talk tech companies often hire foreign born and first generation engineers over native quote unquote Americans isn't because of an innate American IQ deficit.
1404.20 1406.14 SPEAKER_04  Uh, but it comes down to the C word.
1406.24 1406.74 SPEAKER_03  Culture.
1406.74 1410.26 SPEAKER_03  White people to be like, listen, I'm not saying you're all stupid, right?
1410.42 1410.56 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1410.60 1412.52 SPEAKER_03  I'm not saying you're all born stupid.
1413.08 1420.60 SPEAKER_05  Also, also, it's very funny to say there is an innate American IQ problem when it's like, but, but Americans aren't an ethnicity either.
1420.60 1425.20 SPEAKER_05  I mean, no country is really an ethnicity anymore, but America was never an ethnicity.
1425.40 1427.98 SPEAKER_05  And it's always been an assemblage of people from everywhere.
1428.52 1429.96 SPEAKER_05  It's existed as a nation.
1429.96 1439.46 SPEAKER_04  He's so close to pulling out a comparison of like frontal lobe development between like Carolyn and like fucking Bavarian people.
1440.04 1442.86 SPEAKER_04  Like, no, you can't do phrenology that way.
1442.90 1443.96 SPEAKER_04  You're not supposed to.
1444.82 1450.62 SPEAKER_04  Uh, so he says, Our American culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence for way too long.
1450.78 1452.46 SPEAKER_04  And it, and it starts young.
1452.84 1460.66 SPEAKER_04  A college, a culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math Olympiad champ or the jock over the valedictorian will not produce the best engineers.
1460.78 1462.68 SPEAKER_03  It's all high school to these people.
1462.92 1464.30 SPEAKER_03  Like both sides.
1464.30 1481.32 SPEAKER_03  Like one of the guys, one of the guys responding to him, one of the big like white supremacists who was, who was like taking, uh, like a sort of response to him was posting a photo of like a, like a, like a, like a high school quarterback kissing a cheerleader and being like, yeah, how does this make you feel?
1481.32 1488.72 SPEAKER_03  And it's like, did, did either of you like ever sort of like advance beyond high school mentally?
1488.72 1496.46 SPEAKER_04  Well, the problem is our culture venerates Corey from Boy Meets World and Zach and Slater rather than Screech in Saved by the Bell.
1496.56 1499.20 SPEAKER_04  And it's like, what if we venerated Screech in Screeched?
1499.30 1504.20 SPEAKER_03  I, I, I want to, I want to see the like golden statue of Screech outside the Capitol.
1504.46 1504.64 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1504.80 1509.52 SPEAKER_05  At this point, he, and I read this post when he posted it, he genuinely lost me at this point.
1509.66 1515.88 SPEAKER_05  Not in the sense of like lost me in terms of agreeing with him, but just lost me in terms of I no longer follow what you are saying.
1515.88 1520.20 SPEAKER_04  You don't, you don't know the difference between Stefan and Steve Urkel and family matters.
1521.22 1525.64 SPEAKER_03  It's all TV and high school and TV about high school.
1525.76 1535.02 SPEAKER_04  Well, he's going on about how smart he is, but all the reference points is like, well, it's a, he says more movies like whiplash, fewer reruns of friends, more math tutoring, fewer sleepovers.
1535.12 1537.24 SPEAKER_04  It's getting younger as we go on.
1537.32 1539.92 SPEAKER_04  It's like, we have a GI Joe problem in this.
1540.04 1543.52 SPEAKER_04  We have too many action figures and not enough chapter books.
1543.64 1544.12 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1544.12 1546.68 SPEAKER_04  America needs to pick up chapter books.
1546.92 1554.92 SPEAKER_03  Again, the reason why this has been fun is because it's an argument between two groups of people, both of whom are deeply stupid.
1555.40 1555.60 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
1555.88 1560.52 SPEAKER_05  Why, why do the people venerate Captain America rather than Doctor Strange?
1561.18 1562.86 SPEAKER_04  That's what I want to ask today.
1563.22 1565.72 SPEAKER_04  It's like more books, less TV.
1565.72 1572.04 SPEAKER_04  You have named nothing but TV shows and characters from TV shows that were on when you were a kid.
1572.36 1583.20 SPEAKER_04  You were trying to re, you were trying to what, rerun your childhood so that like everybody would have respected you more rather than imaginary jocks.
1583.20 1583.60 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1583.60 1584.56 SPEAKER_04  Which is so funny.
1584.64 1586.70 SPEAKER_05  TLDR, I should have gotten more pussy in high school.
1586.80 1596.02 SPEAKER_03  And it's, it's, it's hardly as if when you look at the sort of like more explicitly white supremacist side of, of Trump world, that they're short on nerds.
1596.02 1598.36 SPEAKER_03  But it's all nerds.
1598.48 1601.50 SPEAKER_03  Like even the ones who think that they're jocks are nerds.
1601.72 1603.84 SPEAKER_03  Have you ever heard Mike Cernovich speak?
1603.84 1614.28 SPEAKER_05  Well, the thing is here though, we need a distinction between nerds qua people who are like smart and interested in esoteric things versus nerds qua people who are just weird.
1614.46 1615.52 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, nerd is an affect.
1616.36 1618.86 SPEAKER_05  Like, yeah, like they have a lot of like weird Reddit guys.
1618.98 1622.62 SPEAKER_05  But I don't know if any of those people are nerds in the way that Vivek Ramaswamy means.
1622.80 1627.90 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, except some of them are like nerds for like esoteric Italian fascisms and stuff.
1628.04 1629.50 SPEAKER_05  But like, yeah, yeah.
1629.64 1632.72 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, it's, they're doing little castor oil references to one another.
1632.72 1641.50 SPEAKER_04  You know, they get them, they've used all their tech billions to build themselves a version of the Benito Mussolini sea wall, but with their own face.
1641.84 1645.04 SPEAKER_04  It says, we've awakened from slumber before and can do it again.
1645.38 1649.44 SPEAKER_04  Trump's election hopefully marks the beginning of a new golden era in America.
1649.44 1657.92 SPEAKER_04  But only if our culture wakes up and prioritizes achievement over normalcy, excellence over mediocrity, nerdiness over conformity, and hard work over laziness.
1658.36 1662.30 SPEAKER_04  And it's like you, but that's, that's the exact message, right?
1662.30 1664.92 SPEAKER_04  I mean, this is, I mean, this is what I was thinking about when I was reading this.
1664.96 1673.64 SPEAKER_04  I was like, okay, well, what the promise is, and again, this is because this is like the, the distinction on the, and I think this is mostly a rhetorical one, by the way.
1673.84 1674.20 SPEAKER_04  Right?
1674.20 1679.14 SPEAKER_04  This is because ultimately the blood and soil nationalists, like they don't, they're useful.
1679.36 1685.78 SPEAKER_04  They're, they're good for like, you know, um, uh, Washington Post, um, columnist to write stories about, uh, but yeah, much like here.
1686.22 1690.98 SPEAKER_04  Ultimately, you know, this is the, uh, this is the, the new forms of capital that are aligned together.
1690.98 1693.60 SPEAKER_04  They don't give a shit about the H1B visa, uh, worker program.
1693.82 1696.92 SPEAKER_04  Fuck it, expand it, make it more like, make it more indentured.
1697.02 1697.50 SPEAKER_04  Who cares?
1697.94 1699.08 SPEAKER_04  You know, Trump doesn't give a shit.
1699.34 1700.54 SPEAKER_04  They certainly don't.
1700.54 1703.50 SPEAKER_04  But you know, what, what reveals to me anyway is a few things.
1703.56 1708.42 SPEAKER_04  Number one, which is we talk about the, the wire getting smaller, right?
1708.46 1719.84 SPEAKER_04  And if you're being told that the problems that you are experiencing, if you're experiencing problems like inflation or whatever, are down to your culture being deficient, then you're on the outside of the wire.
1719.84 1720.26 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1720.44 1730.46 SPEAKER_03  It's really funny because whoever wins in this particular, like kind of, uh, you know, theory fight, somebody is going to be on the outside wearing.
1730.54 1732.60 SPEAKER_03  The big fell for it again, Rosette.
1732.70 1732.92 SPEAKER_03  Right.
1733.08 1745.14 SPEAKER_03  And I think it's funnier if it's, if it's the white supremacists for like a few reasons, the prime one of which being this will be like the fifth time that Donald Trump specifically has done this to them.
1745.24 1749.48 SPEAKER_03  Like they stormed the U S capital for this man.
1749.62 1754.40 SPEAKER_03  And then, and then kind of nothing happened except a bunch of them went to jail.
1754.56 1754.72 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1754.72 1758.16 SPEAKER_05  They got dragged by Azalea Banks and even worse fate than jail.
1759.16 1760.56 SPEAKER_04  And you know, it's over yet.
1760.64 1763.80 SPEAKER_04  Number one, it shows yet you are on the outside of the wire.
1763.80 1767.04 SPEAKER_04  If you're being told, you know, your culture is deficient.
1767.12 1773.18 SPEAKER_04  That's what, I mean, that's basically like what that all of like 1990s racial panics, right?
1773.18 1790.64 SPEAKER_04  So much about like, you know, even though a lot of the stuff like Eric Adams promulgates or the stuff that Boris Johnson promulgated when he was mayor of London is there must be a huge culture change because people who happen to be under the thumb of like police brutality, who are generally disrespected minorities who are on the bottom of the economic ladder.
1790.64 1792.00 SPEAKER_04  They just need better role models.
1792.06 1792.76 SPEAKER_04  They need better music.
1793.04 1797.56 SPEAKER_04  The changes all have to come from, you know, stuff that doesn't materially matter, you know?
1797.60 1809.14 SPEAKER_04  And secondly, it's that it's interesting to see like the extreme libidinal satisfaction that modern conservatism is based on that it motivates people for.
1809.22 1814.62 SPEAKER_04  And this is, um, this is, this is a thought that I was talking about with Gareth Watkins, a guy I know from, from the internet.
1814.62 1817.38 SPEAKER_04  It has to be libidinally satisfying all the time.
1817.54 1825.50 SPEAKER_04  And the way that they usually do that is, uh, is, is by saying, okay, we are, we know who we hate and we are going to be triggering the libs.
1825.56 1826.74 SPEAKER_04  We're going to endlessly trigger the libs.
1826.80 1827.58 SPEAKER_04  The libs are triggered.
1828.08 1829.44 SPEAKER_04  Um, you hate them.
1829.52 1830.22 SPEAKER_04  We hate them.
1830.54 1831.50 SPEAKER_04  Uh, isn't this fun?
1831.70 1839.50 SPEAKER_04  And then, and the, but then when there's something that can't libidinally satisfy all of a sudden, which is like, we are doing the extreme maximalist version.
1839.50 1846.62 SPEAKER_03  Practical questions of how racist do you want this to get in like governance and against whom?
1847.06 1860.26 SPEAKER_04  Well, this, and this is, this is ultimately like, this is what we talk about as well in the, in the UK's March to the Right, which is that the Tory party always promised people, we're going to libidinally satisfy you if you are our core constituent.
1860.26 1865.04 SPEAKER_04  And then they get to govern and they're like, okay, well, we have to manage the country.
1865.28 1869.72 SPEAKER_04  So we're actually not going to be as libidinally satisfying to you as you wish.
1869.78 1878.08 SPEAKER_04  I mean, we let you think, for example, Brexit was going to be like this moment where you actually do get to go and kick the HR manager in your office in the ball.
1878.42 1878.62 SPEAKER_04  Right.
1878.68 1881.06 SPEAKER_04  We, we, we kind of let you think that.
1881.30 1884.28 SPEAKER_05  Brexit was the perfect example because it was never defined.
1884.36 1886.54 SPEAKER_05  It sort of, it meant everything to everyone.
1886.68 1887.84 SPEAKER_03  Brexit meant Brexit.
1888.12 1888.52 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
1888.52 1895.26 SPEAKER_05  You could ask 15 different people who voted Brexit and get 15 different answers as to what they thought they were voting for.
1895.58 1895.64 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1895.74 1902.30 SPEAKER_04  And, but that's, but that, and that's, that's like good politics because that's, everyone can, can hitch their libidinal horse to the same cart.
1902.90 1906.12 SPEAKER_05  And that heart's going to, the cart's going to be pulled to shreds.
1906.16 1907.74 SPEAKER_05  All those horny horses attached to it.
1907.76 1908.82 SPEAKER_04  But that's the problem, right?
1908.82 1913.92 SPEAKER_04  The cart did get pulled to shreds because no, because once they were there, you had to actually govern.
1913.92 1931.78 SPEAKER_04  And then all of those, all of those, like, you know, those energies, those satisfactions, those people that they wanted to see embarrassed, those sweeping changes they wanted, the pleasure that they would get from a wholesale transformation of society that would cause their like imagined enemies and baristas, whatever, to be like, you know, cast at their feet or whatever.
1931.86 1932.38 SPEAKER_04  Didn't happen.
1932.38 1938.78 SPEAKER_05  You can hitch up as many libidinous stallions to that wagon as you want, boy, but eventually them horses gotta fuck.
1939.70 1941.22 SPEAKER_05  And none of that happened.
1941.74 1951.36 SPEAKER_04  And so, you know, that, and so at some point, right, you, until you're willing to take apart more and more and more of the role of governing, right?
1951.36 1961.80 SPEAKER_04  Of managing the delivery of these things that people want with the resources that you have, then someone's always going to come along and say, I'll satisfy more of that libidinal craving.
1962.22 1965.36 SPEAKER_03  Conversely, it's been really funny watching people trying to put the brakes on this.
1965.50 1971.44 SPEAKER_03  Like, besides Vivek, the other big, like, H-1B proponent is Elon Musk.
1971.44 1984.30 SPEAKER_03  And so this is what has led to him being in like Twitter spaces with people under his like fake name with a voice changer on and then banning all of them when they make fun of him.
1984.30 1992.08 SPEAKER_03  Because he, he has remembered the fact that like at some point the kind of self-sabotage has to, has to end, right?
1992.14 2002.54 SPEAKER_03  He's, you know, uh, being a guy who sells electric cars going for the like most anti-electric car administration in history is like itself really funny.
2002.54 2010.94 SPEAKER_03  But being a guy whose entire like sort of corporate presence depends on exploiting H-1B visas, this was a step too far, right?
2010.94 2013.10 SPEAKER_03  He, he needs to exploit those guys.
2013.22 2020.72 SPEAKER_03  And so he, he's like, um, just kind of, uh, sort of tried to, tried to pump the brakes on this.
2020.76 2025.80 SPEAKER_03  And in return, all he's gotten is a bunch of like open Nazis calling him woke and soy.
2026.42 2029.82 SPEAKER_03  And believe me, it could not happen to a better person.
2030.46 2030.56 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2030.68 2032.42 SPEAKER_04  And again, where it will go.
2032.58 2037.18 SPEAKER_04  I mean, one thing we learned, like trying to, trying to think about like the, um.
2037.18 2038.88 SPEAKER_03  I mean, who fucking knows?
2038.88 2041.50 SPEAKER_03  Maybe it'll be some skinhead guy blowing up his pork a share.
2041.76 2042.28 SPEAKER_03  I don't know.
2042.84 2056.92 SPEAKER_04  Like, yeah, it's, it is, it's hard to know because the, the politics that people like Elon wanted, um, or that they thought that they needed because they wanted, they wanted to dismantle the parts of the state they thought were inconvenient.
2056.92 2060.74 SPEAKER_04  They wanted chaos or they just wanted to win or whatever.
2061.14 2061.70 SPEAKER_04  There you go.
2062.02 2063.62 SPEAKER_04  There's your, that's your incoherence.
2063.68 2075.72 SPEAKER_04  I mean, if there's going to be a thread drawn between these two things, November, I think you just drew it, which is more and more chaos as more and as more and more alienated and atomized isolated people are driven to hire.
2075.72 2076.96 SPEAKER_03  It's lump and shit.
2077.20 2079.30 SPEAKER_03  It's, it's, it's, it's more and more lump and shit, right?
2079.30 2086.00 SPEAKER_03  It's like, uh, as, as the kind of like, as elite opinion fractures into this like extreme incoherence, right?
2086.00 2098.90 SPEAKER_03  All that's left is this bunch of people who are like, who want to do something and who want to do something violent and who want to be told who the, like, you know, who the enemy is and who are kind of like slipping their harness.
2099.12 2099.26 SPEAKER_03  Right.
2099.62 2107.30 SPEAKER_03  Um, and I, I think that that is gonna, well, it already has, but it's going to lead to weirder and weirder and weirder outcomes.
2107.90 2107.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2108.00 2111.22 SPEAKER_03  Well, if we want to talk about weird outcomes, we're jumping across the Atlantic.
2111.22 2116.34 SPEAKER_03  Play this shit back to me in the first episode of 2026 so we can see how right I was.
2116.52 2116.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2117.10 2119.10 SPEAKER_04  As we're all locked in a burning Cybertruck.
2119.38 2119.52 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2119.92 2122.26 SPEAKER_04  We're, we're, we're recording from a Cybertruck now.
2122.32 2123.44 SPEAKER_04  We got an endorsement deal.
2124.08 2124.68 SPEAKER_00  That's right.
2124.94 2125.08 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2125.10 2126.60 SPEAKER_03  We're, we're on OnlyFans.
2126.82 2129.22 SPEAKER_03  We're distributing on OnlyFans from our Cybertruck.
2129.48 2131.80 SPEAKER_03  Weirdly, it's an endorsement deal for ISIS, but.
2131.80 2143.96 SPEAKER_04  Well, no, it's an endorsement deal for HTS because they're not only are they off the terror watch list, the government are now actually trying to sign up influencers to be like, hey kids, HTS is fine.
2144.30 2145.28 SPEAKER_05  It's the new Neom.
2145.90 2148.42 SPEAKER_04  People are going to be like, I went on holiday in Damascus and it was great.
2148.80 2154.18 SPEAKER_04  This new Syrian government sent an envoy to Saudi Arabia, if you want to know how that's going.
2154.38 2154.68 SPEAKER_06  Okay.
2154.68 2159.96 SPEAKER_04  But I want to talk a little bit next about Britain because some huge British news has dropped.
2160.46 2161.98 SPEAKER_04  I'm being handed this bulletin.
2162.24 2165.68 SPEAKER_04  Sir Keir Starmer, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, has annoyed holidaymakers.
2166.48 2170.68 SPEAKER_04  I'm being told, yes, the Prime Minister has annoyed holidaymakers.
2170.92 2172.20 SPEAKER_03  No choice but to resign.
2172.68 2173.50 SPEAKER_04  In Madeira.
2173.74 2177.32 SPEAKER_04  The fish, the fish, the fish head rots from the top, unfortunately.
2178.16 2182.88 SPEAKER_03  Hearing, hearing words that Keir Starmer is going to be forced to resign.
2182.88 2184.10 SPEAKER_03  And the thing is, right?
2184.54 2186.06 SPEAKER_03  He said he didn't like dessert wine.
2186.14 2187.22 SPEAKER_03  That went down very poorly.
2188.40 2196.66 SPEAKER_03  No, I think you should just have one with the main and a glass of sparkling, not champagne, torn apart like suddenly last summer.
2196.66 2205.10 SPEAKER_03  I think the thing is, right, whatever they finally do get Keir on, whatever they bring him down with, is probably going to be as stupid.
2205.10 2209.32 SPEAKER_03  Like, because all the actual stuff is like, implicates too many other people.
2209.44 2213.34 SPEAKER_03  We're never going to find out why he was getting kinds of kindness by that guy, right?
2213.44 2216.12 SPEAKER_05  It would be fun if he went down for something you really didn't expect.
2216.34 2218.54 SPEAKER_05  Like Clinton-style blowjob in the office.
2218.98 2221.30 SPEAKER_05  That would be fun for Starmer.
2221.40 2226.24 SPEAKER_03  It would be going out in a kind of like Love Actually-style rom-com scandal.
2226.24 2227.24 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, yeah.
2227.46 2240.60 SPEAKER_04  Here's what I, I think the funniest way for Starmer to go out would be if it turns out that all of the like crazy, like 2012 conservative era rumors about like Obama were true, but for Starmer.
2240.66 2245.20 SPEAKER_03  He was born in Kenya and is therefore apparently ineligible.
2245.72 2247.34 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, he was born in Kenya.
2247.82 2251.08 SPEAKER_04  He's working as a male, like a male sex worker.
2251.34 2252.70 SPEAKER_03  Secret Muslim.
2252.70 2254.38 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, he's a secret Muslim.
2254.38 2256.54 SPEAKER_03  His wife is trans, which is...
2256.54 2257.50 SPEAKER_05  His wife is trans.
2257.54 2262.62 SPEAKER_05  The donkey sanctuary that he was born on wasn't technically a part of the UK when he was born on it.
2262.64 2269.32 SPEAKER_05  It was some kind of like weird forgotten province that due to like a law from the 10 hundreds, he's not a British citizen.
2269.54 2272.08 SPEAKER_05  He's got like a Wessex passport somehow.
2272.88 2273.12 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
2273.74 2276.30 SPEAKER_05  He's pulling out the parchment at airport security.
2277.02 2277.26 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2279.24 2280.88 SPEAKER_04  That's what I want him brought down for.
2280.88 2283.42 SPEAKER_04  Is everything they said about Obama true for him?
2283.92 2284.28 SPEAKER_03  Anyway, no.
2284.34 2290.74 SPEAKER_04  So, Starmer has annoyed holidaymakers in Madeira after he skipped the queue at a toboggan ride during his winter break.
2290.88 2294.78 SPEAKER_03  Honestly, how is a man of this moral stature supposed to lead our country?
2295.06 2299.02 SPEAKER_05  I mean, we laugh, but this is literally what brought down Philip Schofield.
2299.34 2304.10 SPEAKER_05  Like, people only got interested in the pedo stuff because he skipped the queue to watch the Queen.
2304.10 2311.38 SPEAKER_05  We were quite fine with the fact that he was a pedo until he skipped the queue to pay his respects to the dead Queen.
2311.54 2318.00 SPEAKER_05  That is when the British people drew the line and he was subject to attention being paid to what else he was up to.
2318.10 2318.74 SPEAKER_03  That's true, isn't it?
2318.74 2319.32 SPEAKER_03  We fucking...
2319.32 2321.86 SPEAKER_03  It's like Al Capone and tax evasion, right?
2321.86 2323.90 SPEAKER_04  So, I need to add, it wasn't...
2323.90 2325.46 SPEAKER_04  The person was of age.
2325.50 2327.22 SPEAKER_04  It was an improper power relationship.
2327.74 2327.96 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
2328.00 2329.08 SPEAKER_05  I believe the person was of age.
2329.08 2330.34 SPEAKER_05  He met the boy when the boy was very young.
2330.44 2331.22 SPEAKER_04  That was part of it.
2331.34 2334.46 SPEAKER_05  So, it was legal, but it was very...
2334.46 2335.02 SPEAKER_05  It was dodgy.
2335.16 2335.92 SPEAKER_02  That was the implication.
2335.92 2343.66 SPEAKER_04  Okay, well, the Prime Minister was escorted by security to the front of a three-hour queue for the ride with his 16-year-old son and 13-year-old daughter.
2343.78 2349.06 SPEAKER_03  Imagine the kind of dismal job of being Keir Starmer's bodyguard.
2349.52 2352.48 SPEAKER_03  How do you go on a toboggan ride in Portugal?
2352.70 2354.24 SPEAKER_04  Well, I think it's like down just a hill.
2354.74 2356.52 SPEAKER_04  Oh, God, that sounds like it fucking sucks.
2356.88 2359.38 SPEAKER_04  There's a three-hour queue for the toboggan ride in Portugal.
2359.78 2360.84 SPEAKER_03  It must not suck.
2360.94 2362.08 SPEAKER_03  People must love it, I guess.
2362.08 2368.42 SPEAKER_04  Apparently, if you're the Prime Minister, you get to drive your Prime Ministerial car all the way to the front and then down the ride.
2368.86 2369.02 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
2369.48 2373.78 SPEAKER_04  One of the tourists was heard on footage shouting, Get to the back of the queue.
2374.44 2374.88 SPEAKER_05  Great.
2375.90 2379.42 SPEAKER_05  It's so fun to me how much like...
2379.42 2384.78 SPEAKER_05  Because you know over Christmas you get to talk to people who are Tories, which is a fun thing.
2384.88 2386.10 SPEAKER_05  You encounter a few, right?
2386.40 2389.20 SPEAKER_05  And how much they hate Keir Starmer.
2389.30 2390.60 SPEAKER_05  They hate him so much.
2390.60 2394.04 SPEAKER_05  And it's just so funny to me because it's like there's nothing...
2394.04 2396.12 SPEAKER_05  There's nothing really to hate about.
2396.22 2397.58 SPEAKER_05  He's so like nothing-y.
2397.60 2399.12 SPEAKER_05  There's nothing for them to hate.
2399.14 2399.82 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2399.88 2400.34 SPEAKER_00  Okay, yeah.
2400.48 2401.72 SPEAKER_05  But that's what I mean as in like...
2401.72 2404.72 SPEAKER_05  It's basically the same as what was happening before.
2405.28 2405.84 SPEAKER_05  But they're like...
2405.84 2406.90 SPEAKER_05  They're so mad.
2407.00 2408.74 SPEAKER_05  They're so furious about Keir Starmer.
2408.76 2410.34 SPEAKER_05  But this is what we were talking about before, right?
2410.44 2410.58 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2410.58 2410.70 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2411.02 2412.38 SPEAKER_04  The only way...
2412.38 2420.72 SPEAKER_04  The only way to govern in the state that we're living now is to keep people engaged through constantly raising the libidinal stakes.
2420.96 2421.18 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
2421.40 2422.72 SPEAKER_05  Actually, this has just reminded me now.
2422.80 2424.36 SPEAKER_05  This is the thing about Keir Starmer I wanted to say.
2424.98 2427.14 SPEAKER_05  So, he recently...
2427.14 2428.14 SPEAKER_05  I posted this in the group chat.
2428.20 2429.48 SPEAKER_05  He went to a pub in Chesham.
2429.86 2430.68 SPEAKER_05  Or near Chesham.
2430.78 2430.98 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
2430.98 2433.42 SPEAKER_05  And my girlfriend's brother saw him in there and took a picture with him, right?
2433.66 2437.44 SPEAKER_05  Now, I went to that pub on Christmas Eve.
2437.72 2444.10 SPEAKER_05  And I was chatting to some people there who were telling me quite proudly that Keir Starmer had to leave the pub after like about 20 minutes.
2444.10 2446.34 SPEAKER_05  Because people were getting so angry.
2446.42 2447.60 SPEAKER_05  People were spitting on him.
2448.08 2449.16 SPEAKER_05  The pub...
2449.16 2452.92 SPEAKER_05  The landlord and his security team agreed that he would have to leave the pub.
2453.06 2457.88 SPEAKER_05  This is in like a very middle-class Tory London suburb.
2458.34 2458.82 SPEAKER_05  It's incredible.
2459.50 2460.56 SPEAKER_05  It's crazy.
2460.56 2461.56 SPEAKER_05  He's getting like...
2462.10 2462.48 SPEAKER_05  I don't know.
2462.58 2468.92 SPEAKER_05  Like fucking like late period Chochescu levels of hate for doing like boring managerial liberalism.
2469.30 2469.88 SPEAKER_05  It's...
2469.88 2470.62 SPEAKER_05  But from people...
2470.62 2471.52 SPEAKER_05  But from the right.
2472.02 2472.58 SPEAKER_05  That's what's...
2472.58 2473.46 SPEAKER_05  It's insane.
2473.82 2477.82 SPEAKER_04  Well, I mean, I think it's because this is the result of what?
2477.98 2481.38 SPEAKER_04  15 years of stakes raising about like...
2481.38 2484.30 SPEAKER_04  About dangers from the left that are non-existent.
2484.52 2485.54 SPEAKER_04  And so you...
2485.54 2486.30 SPEAKER_04  When you're there...
2486.96 2493.78 SPEAKER_04  If you've chosen the strategy, which are again political and media class have, of always double down on any sort of...
2493.78 2496.96 SPEAKER_04  Any lying, any shit housing, anything.
2497.10 2498.18 SPEAKER_04  Just always double down.
2498.30 2499.12 SPEAKER_04  Always, always, always.
2499.48 2506.54 SPEAKER_04  Then you cannot say to the people who you've spent the last 10 years, 15 years, whatever, radicalizing.
2506.88 2507.36 SPEAKER_04  Right?
2507.36 2510.36 SPEAKER_04  You can't say to them anything other than...
2510.36 2511.16 SPEAKER_03  Can I just push past you?
2511.30 2512.46 SPEAKER_03  I'm actually prime minister.
2513.04 2513.22 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2513.76 2516.28 SPEAKER_04  You can't say to them, this guy...
2516.28 2517.56 SPEAKER_04  This guy's sort of bland.
2517.82 2522.68 SPEAKER_04  It has to always be more dangerous than it's ever been to be like a white Englishman.
2522.94 2524.26 SPEAKER_04  That's the only way it works.
2524.26 2529.06 SPEAKER_05  I almost choked on my pastel donata when Keir Starmer pushed past me.
2529.80 2531.20 SPEAKER_03  But this is it though.
2531.48 2538.32 SPEAKER_03  We're in such a period of polarization and atomization that it's genuinely dangerous.
2538.44 2552.04 SPEAKER_03  I mean, the riots are a good example of this, but you're looking at this and you're thinking, Keir Starmer inspiring this level of personal animus from people who are presumably not that invested in the Corbyn leadership.
2554.20 2555.08 SPEAKER_03  It just...
2555.08 2558.32 SPEAKER_03  All of this is spiraling out of control, right?
2558.32 2573.86 SPEAKER_03  And whether it's Starmer or whatever non-entity replaces him as the next Labour leader and next prime minister is still going to have people baying for their actual blood off of imagined
2573.86 2579.58 SPEAKER_05  grievances. They actually hate him more than the same people hate Jeremy Corbyn, in my opinion.
2579.90 2581.04 SPEAKER_03  That is the vibe I'm getting.
2581.40 2581.52 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2581.86 2593.46 SPEAKER_03  It's going to be like, you know, this situation where it's like, we tried to do very, very moderate social democracy and the entire kind of like spectrum of elite opinion shut that shit down.
2593.94 2601.44 SPEAKER_03  It switched off a bunch of other like, sort of like, events for any kind of public opinion.
2601.44 2604.74 SPEAKER_03  It made everything worse and more precarious.
2605.12 2613.22 SPEAKER_03  It created this and enabled this culture of like, strange Baroque liars like Joe Rogan or whoever else.
2613.38 2627.50 SPEAKER_03  And that's on a path leading to like, Keir Starmer getting like, attacked by someone in a cyber truck full of fireworks, who has an opinion about like, 15 minute cities or something else that he hasn't done.
2627.50 2630.56 SPEAKER_03  Well, grooming gangs, crucially, is going to be the next.
2630.56 2633.42 SPEAKER_05  Brought down by an SUV, like a Greek tragic figure.
2635.30 2639.04 SPEAKER_03  That new translation of the Odyssey takes some real liberty.
2640.18 2642.02 SPEAKER_05  Hoisted by my own petard.
2643.28 2646.30 SPEAKER_05  So rare that classics discourse makes it into the mainstream.
2646.32 2649.38 SPEAKER_03  Wily Odysseus leapt into his Kia Sorento.
2650.66 2654.08 SPEAKER_03  His last words were, now I know what it feels like.
2655.52 2657.30 SPEAKER_03  Cannibal Kia, you eat your people up.
2657.30 2663.08 SPEAKER_04  But yeah, like this is, if we wanted to keep drawing this thread together, which I think is worth doing.
2663.50 2664.90 SPEAKER_04  It's that, you know, it's that.
2664.90 2667.88 SPEAKER_04  Until events draw it together for us, you know.
2668.18 2668.20 SPEAKER_04  Well, yeah.
2668.84 2674.40 SPEAKER_04  Is that the common, what are the things that people, the common decision that the right has made, right?
2674.44 2687.76 SPEAKER_04  And I think this is, again, a quite canny one, is how are you going to align the interests of billionaires, whether these are tech billionaires or oil billionaires like the Koch brothers, and then the vast majority of voters, right?
2687.92 2689.70 SPEAKER_04  How are you going to organize people?
2690.00 2694.06 SPEAKER_04  And it's through a shared hatred of like managerism.
2694.26 2704.88 SPEAKER_04  It's through a shared hatred of things like HR departments or through a shared hatred of things like managerial Democrat or centrist labor politics.
2704.88 2707.46 SPEAKER_04  And to say, oh, this is meddling, right?
2707.50 2708.46 SPEAKER_04  You are being meddled with.
2708.52 2713.80 SPEAKER_04  It's one of the reasons I think, really, it's easier, ultimately, for these people to hate Keir Starmer than for Corbyn.
2714.10 2720.24 SPEAKER_04  Because they're so primed to hate managerial double-speak meddling.
2720.62 2726.82 SPEAKER_04  Because that's the strategy that the right has basically picked on both sides of the Atlantic for the last like 20 years.
2726.82 2737.46 SPEAKER_04  It's also why, you know, the centrist slash right wings of the labor and the Democratic Party are unable to stop being institutional defenders because they are creatures of them.
2737.54 2738.42 SPEAKER_04  They are managers.
2738.70 2749.90 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, and because they are apprehending what it looks like when people are anti-institution, albeit in a like incoherence and very right-wing way, right?
2749.90 2755.98 SPEAKER_03  Like, people like trying to put like Chris Wissy in a headlock when they see him in the tube or whatever.
2757.28 2757.76 SPEAKER_03  Wee.
2757.94 2758.58 SPEAKER_05  He wee.
2759.10 2760.30 SPEAKER_05  Now I say wee.
2760.78 2762.62 SPEAKER_05  I love thinking about that guy.
2762.70 2763.68 SPEAKER_05  He lives in my head.
2764.28 2765.20 SPEAKER_05  Jonathan Witte.
2765.98 2771.26 SPEAKER_05  Jonathan Chew, spelt C-H-E-W, the perfect philosophical opposite of Bevo.
2772.50 2774.76 SPEAKER_03  But yeah, I mean, this is the thing, right?
2774.90 2779.68 SPEAKER_03  These institutions are oftentimes very, very bad, it turns out.
2779.68 2792.04 SPEAKER_03  However, what we are seeing is like a mass sort of like popular mobilization against them in a completely fucked way for all of the wrong reasons, you know?
2792.22 2793.12 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, it's a mass.
2793.24 2797.68 SPEAKER_04  You want to know what a mass popular mobilization of individuals looks like?
2798.54 2798.98 SPEAKER_03  Nonsense.
2799.46 2801.52 SPEAKER_03  Absolute shit nonsense.
2801.76 2807.80 SPEAKER_03  And that's what 2025 is going to be is like more of this, you know?
2807.80 2809.86 SPEAKER_03  You want to get crushed by a sack of potatoes.
2810.00 2810.14 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2810.42 2825.54 SPEAKER_03  And it's like, is the question for like the left such as it is, is like, well, are you so instinctively horrified by much of this stuff, which is horrifying that you want to make common cause with the libs and be like, well, I guess we got to defend these institutions, even though they're imperfect.
2825.98 2831.80 SPEAKER_03  Or do you want to try and harness this kind of like awareness that no, everything is fucked, actually.
2831.80 2834.90 SPEAKER_03  And like, you know, maybe the government is not your friend.
2835.28 2842.54 SPEAKER_03  Is it even possible to do that with people who are like concerned about fucking Bill Gates microchipping them, you know?
2842.80 2842.94 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
2843.36 2848.48 SPEAKER_05  It's really taking the space closer to the chasers option on the chase, isn't it?
2848.54 2854.66 SPEAKER_05  If you say, shall I harness this febrile right wing energy to try and do leftism, actually?
2854.66 2857.76 SPEAKER_05  Because it's either socialist paradise or I am in a camp.
2857.96 2858.14 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2858.14 2859.34 SPEAKER_04  Those are the two outcomes.
2859.78 2862.72 SPEAKER_04  When he said, I was wondering where that chaser sentence was going to go.
2862.90 2863.04 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2863.28 2864.54 SPEAKER_04  I think we both were, yeah.
2864.98 2865.20 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
2865.96 2870.86 SPEAKER_04  Anyway, so this is, so Labour is a version of the chase that looks very different.
2872.48 2874.32 SPEAKER_05  What is muffing, chasers put?
2876.08 2880.10 SPEAKER_04  So Starmer is giving his sort of beginning of year speech.
2880.14 2881.80 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, from a toboggan, curiously.
2881.80 2881.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2882.92 2885.10 SPEAKER_04  If you'll excuse me, I need to pause the speech.
2885.22 2888.22 SPEAKER_04  I've been jumped to the front of the queue and it's time for me to go on the toboggan.
2888.24 2890.14 SPEAKER_05  My administration is not going downhill.
2890.42 2895.06 SPEAKER_05  I am currently going downhill in what I think people might take as a useful visual metaphor.
2895.38 2899.08 SPEAKER_05  But actually, my administration is, if anything, going slightly uphill.
2899.08 2905.94 SPEAKER_05  Not in a way that's a battle, but rather in a sense of ascending to a place of a better view and a nice climate.
2906.16 2911.46 SPEAKER_03  The big traditional Madeira and Wicker basket just wiping out an unrelated Uber Eats rider.
2911.80 2912.36 SPEAKER_03  I'm just...
2912.36 2915.10 SPEAKER_04  I love the...
2915.68 2923.44 SPEAKER_04  Now, yes, I'm going downhill in the toboggan, but I am picking up speed, which Britain will also be doing.
2924.06 2929.26 SPEAKER_05  Going straight towards the fence at the end of the toboggan run with no ability to stop.
2930.88 2933.18 SPEAKER_05  See, Britain is a bit like a toboggan.
2933.74 2938.16 SPEAKER_05  People say to me, Mr. Starmer, your campaign has the momentum of a runaway toboggan.
2938.16 2947.62 SPEAKER_04  So, Labour ends 2024 with a poll rating lower than any other year end for any government since the Second World War.
2947.64 2949.72 SPEAKER_03  People hate every party.
2949.98 2953.76 SPEAKER_03  Like, as much as you kind of, like, gesture to the rise of reform.
2954.26 2955.98 SPEAKER_03  But, like, there is...
2955.98 2959.70 SPEAKER_03  I don't think there's a single party that has more than, like, a 25% approval rating.
2959.96 2960.38 SPEAKER_04  Like...
2960.38 2963.10 SPEAKER_04  Labour has a 27-point approval rating.
2963.10 2963.52 SPEAKER_03  Excuse me.
2963.52 2963.68 SPEAKER_03  Thank you.
2963.68 2963.94 SPEAKER_03  Okay.
2964.26 2964.50 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2964.74 2969.00 SPEAKER_05  You could run, like, woke gay Hitler and he would poll higher than that.
2969.74 2970.94 SPEAKER_05  Well, maybe I will.
2971.20 2971.48 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
2971.62 2971.98 SPEAKER_03  Maybe.
2972.50 2973.14 SPEAKER_03  There you go.
2973.14 2976.12 SPEAKER_03  I like his woke policies and his gay policies.
2976.24 2977.94 SPEAKER_03  Not a fan of his Hitler policies, though.
2978.06 2978.22 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2979.26 2981.24 SPEAKER_03  Where does he stand on the big Hitler book questions?
2981.24 2986.68 SPEAKER_03  It's like every European election, you get to vote Christian Democrat for woke gay Hitler.
2989.12 2994.46 SPEAKER_04  I mean, they said the CIA couldn't do it, and yet they invented Christian democracy.
2995.12 2999.98 SPEAKER_04  So, Starmer's aides insist voters will change their minds as they feel the effect of improvements to public services.
2999.98 3002.34 SPEAKER_03  Once they see him on that toboggan, it'll be all love.
3002.88 3003.06 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3003.36 3003.50 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3004.22 3013.22 SPEAKER_04  Starmer said, that's what we'll be focusing on, a year of rebuilding, but also rediscovering the great nation that we are, a nation that gets things done no matter how hard or tough the circumstances.
3013.44 3014.90 SPEAKER_05  Fucking eat, pray, Starmer.
3015.00 3015.52 SPEAKER_05  What is this?
3016.44 3017.42 SPEAKER_04  Care, pray, love.
3017.78 3027.46 SPEAKER_04  We'll have the time to reflect on this year, a chance with the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, to cherish the greatest victories of this country and the greatest generation that achieved it.
3027.60 3029.52 SPEAKER_04  Motherfucker, you are pandering to dead people.
3029.52 3030.14 SPEAKER_04  Uh-huh.
3030.50 3034.76 SPEAKER_04  Although, I guess it's smart, because the people that you're pandering to most think they were in the Second World War.
3034.76 3035.44 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, the boomers.
3035.50 3035.80 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, exactly.
3036.18 3048.74 SPEAKER_03  And I mean, just to do the kind of managerialist thing for a second, they've set themselves a kind of impossible task, because it's hard intuitively to grasp something being less shit, but still shit.
3049.18 3049.40 SPEAKER_03  You know?
3049.56 3055.88 SPEAKER_03  Like, if you're A&E, right, and you have like a two-hour wait where, you know, last year it would have been a four-hour wait.
3055.88 3060.42 SPEAKER_03  You're not sitting there an hour and 50 minutes in thinking, this is great.
3060.78 3061.28 SPEAKER_03  You know what?
3061.32 3065.56 SPEAKER_03  And you know what I'm really grateful about is the Labour Party and Keir Starmer.
3066.06 3066.32 SPEAKER_04  Well, yeah.
3066.42 3072.98 SPEAKER_04  And if, um, let me also go back to, uh, yeah, you might be fixing some elements of public services this year.
3073.32 3073.78 SPEAKER_04  Maybe.
3074.32 3075.20 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, we'll see.
3075.38 3075.56 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3075.94 3084.28 SPEAKER_04  You've done some things to some elements of it, like pay settlements that were in line with what was required for inflation last year, but not this year.
3084.32 3086.94 SPEAKER_04  You said there's going to be no more money and no more money for councils.
3087.38 3095.74 SPEAKER_04  Councils, which are, of course, on the hook to deliver the vast majority of services that people experience, who are being basically encouraged to gamble to make up the money.
3095.90 3096.18 SPEAKER_04  Bins.
3096.32 3098.86 SPEAKER_04  Ignore the fucking bins at your peril, Starmer.
3098.86 3100.98 SPEAKER_04  I don't, so I don't understand then.
3100.98 3104.94 SPEAKER_04  He's just going back to, we've done largely what we're going to do.
3105.26 3109.26 SPEAKER_04  Everybody keep thinking about the second world war and we'll get through this.
3109.34 3111.26 SPEAKER_04  Maybe with my approval rating above 30%.
3111.26 3115.20 SPEAKER_05  That's how you get British fucking Cybertruck full of gasoline and fireworks, guys.
3115.32 3116.12 SPEAKER_05  Fuck with the bins.
3116.42 3116.72 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3116.90 3119.82 SPEAKER_05  That you're going to get fucking Jabal bins on your case, mate.
3120.12 3126.48 SPEAKER_04  Says, I know there's still much more to do and that for many people, it's hard to think about the future when you spend all of your time fighting to get through the week.
3126.78 3128.20 SPEAKER_04  He kind of went out of the live journal there.
3128.32 3129.56 SPEAKER_04  So I want to be clear.
3129.56 3135.16 SPEAKER_04  Until you can look forward and believe in the promise and prosperity of Britain again, then this government will fight for you.
3135.52 3136.80 SPEAKER_03  Okay, sure, man.
3136.88 3137.80 SPEAKER_04  Sure, fine, right?
3137.86 3146.62 SPEAKER_04  But what I want to contrast that with, of course, is grooming gangs coming up again in British, in like British politics and the British headlines.
3146.72 3147.40 SPEAKER_03  I'll tell you why.
3147.50 3152.64 SPEAKER_03  You have a whole fucking like Moog synthesizer full of buttons you can push and levers you can pull here, right?
3152.64 3161.10 SPEAKER_03  Like if you are anyone who wants to like grift on this shit, could be grooming gangs, could be trans people again, could be channel migrants.
3161.40 3165.02 SPEAKER_03  Whatever is in the news, you can like, and you help make the news.
3165.18 3168.26 SPEAKER_03  You can just turn the big fuck you Keir Starmer dial up.
3168.32 3168.70 SPEAKER_03  Right.
3168.70 3174.76 SPEAKER_04  Well, I'll tell you what happened is Elon Musk remembered Britain, tweeted about it.
3174.86 3192.20 SPEAKER_04  And now Nigel Farage and Kemi Badenoch are both falling over one another to promise him more and more and more as regards sort of basically what collective punishment of like South Asian people on the basis of like a spurious link to like grooming gangs.
3192.20 3197.96 SPEAKER_03  He's been, he's been like on some like free Tommy Robinson shit on Twitter as well.
3198.04 3198.18 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3198.32 3217.96 SPEAKER_04  Well, and this is, this is something I said once when it, when it became clear that the right wing parties in Britain understood that whoever wins Elon Musk will basically get infinite money is that it was like, if he just says, make Tommy Robinson a Lord, then Kemi Badenoch and Nigel Farage are going to fall over themselves to do it.
3217.96 3232.90 SPEAKER_04  Or rather the question is, is Kemi, does Kemi Badenoch have enough of that dog in her that she understands that she has to give so much more libidinal satisfaction via policy change, such as making Tommy Robinson a Lord.
3233.10 3235.68 SPEAKER_02  More red meat, more stupid bullshit.
3236.00 3236.12 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3236.32 3236.54 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3236.82 3237.14 SPEAKER_02  Exactly.
3237.14 3238.64 SPEAKER_02  Lord Robinson of Luton.
3238.82 3239.72 SPEAKER_02  We could be there.
3240.12 3245.82 SPEAKER_03  And to be honest, I don't think so, because I think that's, that's Nigel Farage is like home territory.
3246.22 3247.92 SPEAKER_03  He's used to that, you know?
3248.96 3256.22 SPEAKER_03  Like the conservative party tried to adapt to Farage by coming up with the most lunatic person they could.
3256.46 3262.26 SPEAKER_03  The person who was best at extemporizing shit, like we should electrify the channel or whatever the fuck.
3262.52 3262.72 SPEAKER_03  Right.
3262.80 3266.96 SPEAKER_03  And it's, she still doesn't have as good a handle on it as he does.
3267.68 3268.12 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
3268.12 3273.14 SPEAKER_05  She really feels like a kind of Mr. Magoo like figure, but who it doesn't work out for.
3273.90 3275.14 SPEAKER_05  Mr. Magoont.
3275.66 3281.60 SPEAKER_05  She sort of ended up as leader of the conservative party, but she wasn't really supposed to be like James Cleverley was supposed to be.
3281.76 3282.08 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
3282.20 3287.44 SPEAKER_05  And like under the correct circumstances, he would have won the election, but for the fact that his supporters were idiots.
3288.04 3289.26 SPEAKER_05  But then, so then he lost to her.
3289.34 3293.68 SPEAKER_05  And then now she just, she just seems like really out of her depth at like every juncture.
3293.68 3313.88 SPEAKER_04  Of course, because she's someone who came up through a political system where she was being assisted at every turn by every like think tanker and columnist and fellow in the conservative party, uh, whoever like looked at her because she was the person who was going to, who's willing to be the right wing engine of the party.
3313.88 3318.08 SPEAKER_04  Again, it's like, you're, you, you don't understand what's involved in governing.
3318.20 3324.34 SPEAKER_04  You just know how to do like the, you just know how to like summon up the anger really
3324.34 3327.88 SPEAKER_03  because you know what buttons to put. You're, you're the cyber truck for the fireworks whisperer.
3328.76 3329.58 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, exactly.
3330.00 3336.02 SPEAKER_05  But she does have like kind of a Trump quality where she's often doing something a bit weird, like wearing moon boots to meet those guys at Davos.
3336.38 3336.52 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3336.62 3338.34 SPEAKER_05  Being anti sandwich.
3339.10 3339.32 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
3339.32 3339.52 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
3339.72 3339.96 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
3339.96 3341.06 SPEAKER_05  The sandwiches thing.
3341.14 3341.84 SPEAKER_05  That was crazy.
3342.08 3349.08 SPEAKER_04  And so, you know, this is, and again, like what now what's happening, of course, is that people who are, who are like Tories, like Chris Philp.
3349.26 3350.06 SPEAKER_04  Incredible name.
3350.14 3352.92 SPEAKER_05  Sort of name you'd get by being cut off by a character count.
3353.28 3354.32 SPEAKER_04  Shadow home secretary.
3354.86 3366.50 SPEAKER_04  Again, now has to, all of his like respectable career building that he did for so long as being the person who manages the baying hounds, not the person who's like in there with them.
3366.50 3388.08 SPEAKER_04  Now, once again, has to go up on, on like, you know, fucking like on the radio and say, well, I can't speculate about Keir Starmer's personal motivations because now the official line as, as delivered by Elon Musk to the political right of the UK is Keir Starmer personally supported the grooming gang because he was too woke to prosecute them or whatever.
3388.28 3389.38 SPEAKER_04  Right now.
3389.44 3391.82 SPEAKER_03  Now you, if you're Chris Philp, now you have to be like, okay.
3391.82 3400.88 SPEAKER_03  It just, he was, he was unable to refute the allegation that he had led a series of grooming gangs because he was in a toboggan, rapidly moving away from the microphone.
3403.06 3406.72 SPEAKER_04  I can't speculate about Starmer's personal motivations.
3407.08 3409.02 SPEAKER_04  Speculation, rumors, and conspiracies are not good enough.
3409.10 3409.78 SPEAKER_04  We need the truth.
3409.88 3413.50 SPEAKER_04  And only a statutory public inquiry looking at this on a national basis will get the truth.
3413.96 3420.10 SPEAKER_04  And again, I don't want to go through, oh, well, what inquiries have been, have been called for by whom and where and who said yes and who said no.
3420.10 3421.66 SPEAKER_04  And who has the right authority?
3421.76 3425.70 SPEAKER_04  Can it be old and can it be the, the, like the national government to go back to?
3425.82 3434.70 SPEAKER_04  It's known that like the, this story is used by like right wing fucking like race baiters to like whip up panic about South Asians.
3434.84 3446.44 SPEAKER_04  And as far as I'm aware, most of what it exposed is critical failings in the, in like the sec, in the sector of like the, um, of the state that's supposed to care for vulnerable young people.
3446.44 3455.38 SPEAKER_04  It didn't expose like there's a special like Pakistani brain lobe that makes you a groomer, which is what these people seem like they want to reveal.
3455.38 3467.72 SPEAKER_04  And they're not going to be, they're not going to let it go until there's an official government document that says, yes, the United Kingdom has, has agreed that being Pakistani gives you a special brain lobe that makes you a groomer.
3467.80 3470.36 SPEAKER_04  That's the way, that's the only place they want to stop at.
3470.36 3477.76 SPEAKER_04  And again, the question is with bad knock and Farage and Musk together, they all want to drive it towards that place as much as they can.
3477.76 3481.70 SPEAKER_04  And who's going to have the balls to stay on for longest, right?
3482.18 3482.40 SPEAKER_03  Hmm.
3482.52 3488.06 SPEAKER_03  And it's, it's, it's, it's much like the, the popular game buckaroo, right?
3488.14 3498.18 SPEAKER_03  Except instead of a plastic, uh, donkey laden down with implements, it's a cyber truck laden down with fireworks, camping fuel canisters and cans of petrol.
3498.18 3501.26 SPEAKER_04  So yeah, I want to move on to one more thing.
3501.26 3503.94 SPEAKER_04  So we can, we can talk about a startup called Squibbler.
3504.48 3506.66 SPEAKER_04  Oh, I beg your fucking pardon.
3507.12 3507.54 SPEAKER_04  Uh, sorry.
3507.60 3516.58 SPEAKER_04  I wanted one more thing actually, which is when I was looking into some of the recent writing about sort of, um, Elon Musk, the sort of summary of Elon Musk talking about, about Starmer.
3516.96 3523.06 SPEAKER_04  One of the funniest things was in the article saying Elon Musk tells Keir Starmer to leave farmers alone in tax row.
3523.26 3527.26 SPEAKER_04  That was written by a times news reporter called Emma Yeoman.
3527.26 3531.10 SPEAKER_04  Really good.
3531.76 3531.96 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3531.96 3532.34 SPEAKER_04  Amazing.
3532.64 3532.78 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3532.84 3533.46 SPEAKER_04  Emma Yeoman.
3533.84 3534.20 SPEAKER_04  Beautiful.
3534.62 3551.08 SPEAKER_04  So we have, uh, we have Squibbler or, um, whoever it is in the Saudi Royal family that just like calls the Wall Street Journal when they want to reveal like some insane shit about Neom has called the Wall Street Journal again.
3551.28 3551.92 SPEAKER_03  Squib me.
3552.04 3553.02 SPEAKER_03  We do Neom next time.
3553.10 3553.30 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3553.30 3553.74 SPEAKER_04  Okay.
3553.94 3554.28 SPEAKER_04  All right.
3554.36 3556.46 SPEAKER_04  So Neom coming in the free episode.
3556.62 3557.14 SPEAKER_03  We're squibbing.
3557.36 3559.14 SPEAKER_03  I feel, I feel the need, the need to squib.
3559.48 3559.78 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3559.96 3560.30 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3560.76 3562.66 SPEAKER_04  We're, we're speaking that, we're speaking that squib.
3562.66 3564.18 SPEAKER_05  Batman's mortal enemy, the Squibbler.
3564.42 3564.54 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3566.22 3566.66 SPEAKER_05  So.
3566.92 3568.54 SPEAKER_05  He's covered in damp squibs.
3568.96 3569.30 SPEAKER_04  Wait, wait.
3569.30 3575.40 SPEAKER_04  So Batman's mortal enemy, the Squibbler, who pulls up, who does evil schemes that just don't go off.
3575.74 3576.14 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
3576.36 3577.56 SPEAKER_05  They're very disappointing.
3577.98 3579.18 SPEAKER_05  And that's why Batman hates it.
3579.24 3580.52 SPEAKER_01  He's just like, oh, it was pointless.
3580.64 3581.54 SPEAKER_01  Me were turning off.
3582.34 3583.54 SPEAKER_01  This is twice my time.
3583.88 3584.76 SPEAKER_01  Damn you, Squibbler.
3586.20 3588.44 SPEAKER_04  It turns out he forgot to watch Batman.
3588.84 3589.56 SPEAKER_04  It's great news.
3589.64 3592.50 SPEAKER_04  Squibbler forgot to wire the explosives in the bank vault.
3592.62 3593.20 SPEAKER_04  He's got ADHD.
3593.60 3594.06 SPEAKER_04  Damn it.
3594.06 3596.50 SPEAKER_03  You've distracted me from my girlfriend again.
3596.66 3599.50 SPEAKER_03  Getting charged with like wasting Batman time.
3600.18 3602.62 SPEAKER_03  Wasting police time, but it's just him.
3602.94 3605.64 SPEAKER_04  That's the only crime that Batman will actually kill you for.
3606.24 3608.82 SPEAKER_04  Everything else will just like chase you around and put you in jail.
3608.94 3613.38 SPEAKER_04  But Batman will fully put two bullets in your brain if you waste his time.
3613.56 3614.68 SPEAKER_01  I've warned you, Squibbler.
3615.14 3616.24 SPEAKER_01  Albert's terminally ill.
3616.32 3617.46 SPEAKER_01  These are precious moments.
3618.12 3621.02 SPEAKER_01  Every moment of my time you waste his time, I don't get with him.
3621.02 3624.22 SPEAKER_01  And the Squibbler.
3625.00 3625.42 SPEAKER_04  All right.
3625.52 3625.70 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3625.82 3627.32 SPEAKER_04  Well, that's the thing.
3627.56 3629.72 SPEAKER_04  That's better than what it actually is.
3629.88 3630.42 SPEAKER_03  I wish.
3630.60 3632.36 SPEAKER_03  What could it possibly be?
3632.44 3646.50 SPEAKER_04  I wish that somebody, instead of funding the same kind of, you know, bullshit startups that we usually talk about, I wish that they had funded a Batman movie where he fights
3646.50 3655.58 SPEAKER_05  a villain who pisses him off by being shitty at being a villain. There used to be a chain of shops in the UK called Squibbler that sold those kind of cards.
3655.78 3656.48 SPEAKER_02  Oh, you mean Scribbler?
3656.56 3657.24 SPEAKER_05  Oh, Scribbler.
3657.24 3657.74 SPEAKER_04  You're right.
3657.94 3658.12 SPEAKER_04  You're right.
3658.24 3658.54 SPEAKER_04  I thought it was.
3658.96 3661.14 SPEAKER_05  There were those cards where it's like, it's mom's birthday.
3661.26 3662.60 SPEAKER_05  She's had 14 gins.
3662.74 3665.22 SPEAKER_05  And then it's like a picture of a woman from the 50s falling over.
3665.38 3665.60 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3665.70 3665.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3666.06 3667.26 SPEAKER_04  It's if you were in Britain.
3667.64 3668.02 SPEAKER_04  Hilarious.
3668.14 3671.70 SPEAKER_04  If you're in Britain and you wanted a lewd pen, you would go to Squibbler.
3671.94 3672.30 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3672.56 3672.82 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3672.82 3674.02 SPEAKER_04  That's also not what this is.
3674.24 3674.40 SPEAKER_06  No.
3674.52 3674.66 SPEAKER_04  No.
3674.66 3676.34 SPEAKER_04  It's all lewd pens.
3676.64 3676.84 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3676.98 3684.04 SPEAKER_04  It's another of the AI writing tools, but this one has more about it that I wanted to explore.
3684.26 3684.50 SPEAKER_04  Okay.
3684.76 3686.92 SPEAKER_04  So Squibbler is an AI story writer.
3687.32 3690.54 SPEAKER_04  Generate full length novels in minutes with AI.
3690.54 3691.06 SPEAKER_04  Oh no.
3691.50 3692.22 SPEAKER_04  Squibbling away.
3692.22 3692.30 SPEAKER_04  Okay.
3693.30 3701.44 SPEAKER_04  The supercharged AI story writer that creates full length books, novels, and screenplays is just a few clicks instantly ready for print and online.
3701.80 3703.96 SPEAKER_03  Don't, don't, don't squibble me a novel.
3704.38 3707.76 SPEAKER_03  I don't, I don't, I don't want to read something that's been squibbled.
3708.28 3708.50 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
3708.80 3712.72 SPEAKER_03  I mean, oh wait, it's like scribbled, but then a stupid baby voice.
3712.82 3713.10 SPEAKER_03  Okay.
3713.22 3713.64 SPEAKER_03  Got you.
3713.92 3714.32 SPEAKER_03  Squibble.
3714.70 3714.98 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3715.54 3716.22 SPEAKER_01  Curse you, Squibbler.
3716.22 3717.04 SPEAKER_01  Curse you, Squibbler.
3717.28 3719.46 SPEAKER_01  You've wasted my time with an AI generated novel.
3719.46 3722.30 SPEAKER_01  The blob was very pedestrian.
3723.16 3724.06 SPEAKER_01  It's derivative.
3724.52 3726.86 SPEAKER_01  I'm trying to read, I'm trying to read my smart.
3729.96 3733.52 SPEAKER_03  Batman reading slow burn coffee shop, hey you.
3734.24 3737.40 SPEAKER_01  No one wants to read Dean Kuntz slash fiction.
3738.36 3739.54 SPEAKER_04  We could, okay.
3740.40 3743.24 SPEAKER_04  November said AI can never be good, but it can be funny.
3743.38 3749.20 SPEAKER_04  Could we get Squibbler to write us a book about a book in the style of Dean Kuntz?
3749.20 3752.00 SPEAKER_04  If he was an artist in this style of Dean Kuntz?
3752.00 3754.38 SPEAKER_03  I mean, probably, but I think it might be unethical.
3754.70 3760.12 SPEAKER_03  The thing about this, right, I'm not so worried about, I do not fear the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks.
3760.20 3762.40 SPEAKER_03  I practiced the guy who's practiced one kick 10,000 times.
3762.52 3769.94 SPEAKER_03  I don't fear Squibbler on the same, for the same basis that like Spotify is the thing everyone uses and not Last.fm.
3770.68 3778.22 SPEAKER_03  Almost solely because Last.fm called the thing that you do when you listen to a song a scrobble, right?
3778.36 3786.20 SPEAKER_03  So you, you, your Last.fm wrapped would say something like, you scrobbled 50,000 songs this year, or whatever the fuck.
3786.46 3790.70 SPEAKER_03  By the same token, I don't believe anyone is going to be squibbling anything.
3790.70 3796.50 SPEAKER_03  But I do think the second they come up with a less dumb name for it, they will absolutely be doing it.
3796.92 3801.94 SPEAKER_05  Scrobbling really feels like a word that you and Matty Lubchansky would explain to me and Riley with a heavy heart.
3802.90 3805.70 SPEAKER_04  It's like, how do you know what squabbling is?
3806.12 3808.56 SPEAKER_04  I've scrobbled quibs you'll never believe.
3808.56 3812.84 SPEAKER_03  That's some shit from like Master and Commander.
3814.38 3815.72 SPEAKER_04  Yes, you there, scrobble the quib.
3816.66 3818.12 SPEAKER_04  Oh, yes sir, right away sir.
3818.34 3819.94 SPEAKER_04  I'm a 10 year old veteran of combat.
3820.26 3822.40 SPEAKER_03  That's what they sound like, Master and Commander, famously.
3823.02 3826.16 SPEAKER_04  Don't you know a man should never scrobble a quib, boy?
3826.70 3828.28 SPEAKER_04  So, what type of story are you writing?
3828.46 3831.48 SPEAKER_04  Pick a template and then use our AI-assisted editor to complete it.
3831.74 3835.34 SPEAKER_04  At Squibbler, we're devoted to helping storytellers write and create more stories.
3835.34 3839.94 SPEAKER_04  As avid book readers and writers, we wanted a simple tool that could make the writing process easier.
3840.32 3842.68 SPEAKER_04  We hope to publish a million books through our software.
3842.82 3845.22 SPEAKER_04  Let a million books bloom via Squibbler.
3845.58 3847.48 SPEAKER_04  Let a million squibs crobble.
3847.72 3850.02 SPEAKER_05  People are entitled to their squibbling proclivities.
3850.52 3852.08 SPEAKER_03  Books by the yard, right?
3852.16 3854.18 SPEAKER_03  Like, we're not going to publish like great books.
3854.26 3855.96 SPEAKER_03  We're not going to publish interesting books.
3856.24 3858.16 SPEAKER_03  We're not going to publish commercially successful books.
3858.20 3860.68 SPEAKER_03  We're just going to publish a lot of books.
3860.92 3867.70 SPEAKER_04  Well, I ask you to help us on our journey as we empower the writer, community to strive to make...
3867.70 3868.38 SPEAKER_03  They're not writing!
3869.18 3870.82 SPEAKER_03  The computer's doing it!
3871.12 3873.28 SPEAKER_03  Identity politics, but for writing?
3873.88 3874.76 SPEAKER_03  Like...
3874.76 3876.54 SPEAKER_03  The writer X community.
3876.96 3877.62 SPEAKER_03  A person of words?
3878.12 3878.82 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, I love this.
3879.04 3879.10 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3879.30 3880.34 SPEAKER_04  The person of...
3880.34 3880.52 SPEAKER_03  Or POW.
3880.76 3886.16 SPEAKER_04  I'm flying the person of words flag to protest the guy still left in Vietnam.
3886.40 3887.62 SPEAKER_04  No writers at Pride.
3888.62 3891.18 SPEAKER_03  Okay, I kind of actually believe that one.
3891.18 3891.74 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3892.12 3898.42 SPEAKER_04  As we empower the writer community to, and I'm quoting this exact quote, strive for more with fewer words.
3899.28 3902.14 SPEAKER_04  My least favorite thing about being a writer, it's the words.
3902.26 3903.38 SPEAKER_03  I hate writing the words.
3903.40 3907.38 SPEAKER_03  What if you just had like a vibe and then somebody else squibbled that shit for you?
3907.70 3908.10 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3908.30 3908.88 SPEAKER_04  How about that?
3909.26 3911.40 SPEAKER_04  So it says, what kind of story are you writing?
3911.60 3914.64 SPEAKER_03  You just go, it was the best of times.
3915.34 3916.72 SPEAKER_03  Squibble beyond the rest of it.
3916.80 3917.64 SPEAKER_04  Carry on from there.
3917.74 3918.04 SPEAKER_03  Squibble.
3918.04 3918.74 SPEAKER_04  Insert twist.
3919.12 3919.28 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3920.22 3921.50 SPEAKER_04  Can we get a twist there?
3921.98 3923.50 SPEAKER_04  What type of story are you writing?
3923.90 3926.96 SPEAKER_04  Pick the perfect template for you, then use our editor to develop your story.
3927.34 3928.04 SPEAKER_04  So you can write...
3928.70 3936.94 SPEAKER_04  Their example is, you can write fiction, like The Alchemist by Paolo Coelho, or you can write non-fiction, like Sapiens by Yuval Noah Hariri.
3937.48 3938.10 SPEAKER_04  I love it.
3938.40 3938.60 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3938.86 3941.98 SPEAKER_04  Could you write me a non-fiction book like Sapiens, please?
3942.84 3944.02 SPEAKER_05  Absolutely incredible.
3944.50 3947.00 SPEAKER_05  Could you write me Thinking Fast and Slow, please?
3947.00 3948.68 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, but make it original for me.
3948.98 3952.60 SPEAKER_03  Everything that squibbles turns out to be the original text of Freakonomics, somehow.
3952.94 3954.08 SPEAKER_03  They don't know why.
3954.16 3954.84 SPEAKER_03  They've gone into it.
3954.88 3955.60 SPEAKER_03  They've looked at things.
3955.66 3956.94 SPEAKER_03  It's doing a different thing every time.
3957.00 3958.98 SPEAKER_03  But no matter what prompt you put in, Freakonomics.
3959.08 3959.20 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3959.80 3966.20 SPEAKER_04  You didn't think that Freakonomics could be to be transplanted into like the social world of early 19th century Britain.
3966.20 3967.20 SPEAKER_04  And yet here we are.
3967.30 3967.54 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3967.96 3971.60 SPEAKER_04  You could also do a script like Chinatown or a screenplay like John Wick.
3972.18 3973.48 SPEAKER_03  Translates me the Odyssey.
3973.48 3973.88 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3974.84 3975.96 SPEAKER_04  But make it not woke.
3976.04 3977.96 SPEAKER_04  Do a non-woke translation of the Odyssey.
3978.52 3978.72 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3979.12 3981.18 SPEAKER_04  This is like drinking beers with the boys.
3981.66 3985.42 SPEAKER_04  Squibbler's AI writer addresses problems common and unique to every story writer.
3985.68 3986.44 SPEAKER_04  Here are just a few.
3986.92 3988.52 SPEAKER_04  Full-length book generation.
3989.66 3990.08 SPEAKER_04  That's...
3990.88 3992.92 SPEAKER_04  It is hard to generate a full-length book.
3993.00 3993.56 SPEAKER_04  That is true.
3993.60 3993.80 SPEAKER_03  That's true.
3993.84 3995.48 SPEAKER_03  I'm so seldom generating those.
3995.48 3998.38 SPEAKER_04  Full-length screenplay generation.
3998.60 3999.66 SPEAKER_04  Story outline generation.
4000.04 4000.92 SPEAKER_04  AI smart writer.
4001.16 4002.18 SPEAKER_04  Element creation.
4002.70 4003.62 SPEAKER_04  Visual generation.
4003.84 4004.36 SPEAKER_04  And templates.
4004.74 4005.20 SPEAKER_05  These are...
4005.20 4008.56 SPEAKER_05  But you see, the problem they're having there is those aren't problems that writers have.
4008.66 4014.40 SPEAKER_05  Those are a list of features of their company and product, which they wish were also problems that writers have.
4014.70 4015.36 SPEAKER_05  But they're not...
4015.36 4016.86 SPEAKER_05  They're completely different from the problems, right?
4016.86 4027.62 SPEAKER_05  The problem is writers have a, like, alcoholism, a decaying relationship with your wife, you know, not having any ideas, stuff like that.
4027.76 4031.00 SPEAKER_04  Well, if you don't have any ideas or if you have, like, a kind of a vague idea...
4031.00 4032.86 SPEAKER_04  So it says, let's create your book.
4033.10 4034.58 SPEAKER_04  So this is the example they give.
4034.88 4035.18 SPEAKER_04  Title.
4035.34 4036.56 SPEAKER_04  And then the funniest thing ever.
4036.86 4037.16 SPEAKER_04  Title.
4037.38 4037.86 SPEAKER_04  In parentheses.
4038.20 4038.68 SPEAKER_04  Optional.
4039.88 4040.30 SPEAKER_04  It's fine.
4040.66 4041.82 SPEAKER_04  They'll do that for us.
4041.90 4042.00 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
4042.36 4043.12 SPEAKER_04  So title.
4043.26 4043.64 SPEAKER_04  Optional.
4044.04 4046.30 SPEAKER_05  You can always just put in Freakonomics if you're not sure.
4046.30 4047.90 SPEAKER_04  The Marathon Mindset.
4048.00 4049.80 SPEAKER_04  Building Endurance Beyond the Finish Line.
4050.02 4051.26 SPEAKER_04  What's your book going to be about?
4051.60 4062.70 SPEAKER_04  A book about transforming the marathon experience into a lifelong philosophy exploring mental toughness, discipline, and resilience needed to get a message back to Athens after the conclusion of the first Persian War.
4063.02 4064.24 SPEAKER_05  What a twist.
4064.94 4068.42 SPEAKER_05  This is such a bad example because, like, this is the kind of...
4068.42 4071.30 SPEAKER_04  I added the Greek reference that's not...
4071.30 4075.60 SPEAKER_05  No, no, but I mean, even before that, just using that concept as an example is so bad.
4075.60 4077.60 SPEAKER_05  I mean, I'm talking about them, not you using it as an example.
4077.90 4085.10 SPEAKER_05  But, like, because that is the kind of book that would necessarily have to be drawn from some kind of personal experience or, like, not...
4085.10 4086.26 SPEAKER_05  Like, it's at least...
4086.26 4090.00 SPEAKER_05  Okay, a fiction book, an AI can theoretically make up a fiction book.
4090.16 4092.18 SPEAKER_05  Like, it'll be bad, but, like, it can do it.
4092.26 4095.24 SPEAKER_05  There's no, like, philosophical problem with an AI doing that.
4095.24 4103.34 SPEAKER_05  But, like, with a book like that where it's, like, how I overcame the thing, but how would it not have any of the experience to draw on?
4103.68 4105.18 SPEAKER_04  Well, because this sort of says...
4105.18 4111.66 SPEAKER_04  This is a book, generally, that they've generated as an example about transforming the marathon experience in general into lifelong philosophy.
4111.66 4113.66 SPEAKER_04  But then the book that they generate is...
4113.66 4115.66 SPEAKER_04  The crisp morning air...
4115.66 4118.74 SPEAKER_04  And this is, like, I screenshotted this from, like, a video that was autoplaying.
4118.78 4121.14 SPEAKER_04  It took me, like, four goes to actually snap it.
4121.80 4126.44 SPEAKER_04  The crisp morning air nipped at my cheeks as I stood in the starting line, a sea of humanity stretching before me.
4126.78 4132.96 SPEAKER_04  My heart pounded a rhythm against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat mirroring the anticipation that hummed through the crowd.
4133.00 4134.16 SPEAKER_04  God, this fucking sucks.
4134.54 4135.68 SPEAKER_04  This wasn't just another race.
4135.68 4137.92 SPEAKER_04  It was the culmination of months of relentless training.
4138.46 4140.64 SPEAKER_04  A wave of memories washed over me.
4140.86 4142.68 SPEAKER_04  A lot of, uh, water metaphors.
4143.50 4145.10 SPEAKER_04  Sea of humanity, a wave of memories.
4145.64 4148.64 SPEAKER_04  Each once a stepping stone on my journey to this very moment.
4149.08 4151.10 SPEAKER_04  The hesitant jog around the block that started it all.
4151.20 4152.46 SPEAKER_04  The first race I ever ran.
4152.56 4154.88 SPEAKER_04  The agonizing moments of doubt that almost led me to quit.
4154.92 4161.76 SPEAKER_03  This is so, like, mechanical in a very real sense that it's actively unpleasant to listen to.
4162.12 4162.30 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
4162.74 4164.26 SPEAKER_03  The AI that wants you to piss.
4164.26 4166.46 SPEAKER_05  It just keeps doing water metaphors.
4166.72 4168.02 SPEAKER_04  This book is not simply a guide to running.
4168.14 4174.50 SPEAKER_04  It's a blueprint for resilience, a map for navigating the emotional and mental landscapes of a marathon in the track and in life.
4174.86 4176.50 SPEAKER_04  Here we'll explore the transformative power of running.
4176.66 4176.96 SPEAKER_04  Delving.
4177.08 4177.42 SPEAKER_04  Delving.
4177.52 4178.32 SPEAKER_04  It says delving.
4178.48 4179.34 SPEAKER_04  They love to delve.
4179.72 4180.78 SPEAKER_04  They're like dwarves.
4181.10 4181.24 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
4181.64 4186.34 SPEAKER_05  They write, like, UCAS personal statements crossed with SEO text.
4186.40 4189.94 SPEAKER_04  Ultimately, right, there's so many of the things we talk about on this show.
4189.94 4194.64 SPEAKER_04  A big subset of what we talk about in this show is product, cultural products especially.
4195.32 4198.08 SPEAKER_04  Books, movies, and so on that are not meant to be watched.
4198.36 4203.14 SPEAKER_04  Whether it's Netflix making something because they have to keep making stuff and it doesn't matter if you watch it.
4203.30 4206.48 SPEAKER_04  It matters if one million people watch one minute of it.
4206.60 4207.76 SPEAKER_04  That's all they care about, right?
4207.80 4208.74 SPEAKER_04  Like Spencer Confidential.
4208.74 4214.48 SPEAKER_04  Or books that are written so that some think tanker can have a bestseller that the think tank then buys all the copies of.
4214.74 4220.74 SPEAKER_04  This is all stuff that's like, it has to exist, but it's never meant to be, like, consumed in any meaningful way.
4221.44 4223.10 SPEAKER_05  It's like a lot of PowerPoints.
4223.16 4223.82 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, exactly.
4224.38 4230.02 SPEAKER_04  And so this is all, again, like, even like the vanity publishing stuff we talked about that Israeli startup, Spines.
4230.02 4241.20 SPEAKER_04  You know, all of this is stuff that's like, these are books that are never really meant to be read because people just want to have a book out.
4241.48 4253.72 SPEAKER_04  Or if they are meant to be read, a lot of it is like, a lot of the people that they give as their example of squibbler writers are like, you know, straight to Kindle, 99p to download erotic fantasy writers.
4253.86 4254.28 SPEAKER_06  Right?
4254.28 4259.24 SPEAKER_04  Like fiction that is so genre, it might as well be AI generated.
4259.66 4259.82 SPEAKER_04  Right?
4260.02 4260.36 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
4260.42 4262.86 SPEAKER_04  So they say, ready to go from script to production?
4263.40 4267.70 SPEAKER_04  These were once just ideas until the writer decided to take the next step and use Scribbler.
4268.36 4269.28 SPEAKER_04  Scribbler, excuse me.
4269.86 4275.86 SPEAKER_04  So the examples that they give, again, I had to, like, capture and zoom in on this, is Thunder Machines, written by Jake Turner.
4276.48 4278.20 SPEAKER_04  Int Quantum Realm Day.
4278.52 4280.78 SPEAKER_04  Strange cosmic energy surge the quantum realm.
4280.90 4283.76 SPEAKER_04  The Avengers, led by Captain America, navigate the swirling vortex.
4284.44 4287.74 SPEAKER_04  They clutch Plym particles preparing for a journey through time.
4288.20 4290.00 SPEAKER_04  Cut to External Battle of New York.
4290.02 4290.34 SPEAKER_04  Day.
4290.34 4292.24 SPEAKER_04  The Avengers appear amid the chaos.
4292.40 4294.46 SPEAKER_04  Past versions of themselves engage in the Battle of New York.
4294.98 4297.72 SPEAKER_04  Tony Stark sneaks into Stark Towers to retrieve the Tesseract.
4297.90 4304.14 SPEAKER_04  They haven't even bothered to, like, have them be scripts.
4304.58 4304.78 SPEAKER_04  Hmm.
4304.78 4311.02 SPEAKER_03  It just kind of sounds vaguely like one, which is the kind of, like, that's AI.
4311.38 4312.90 SPEAKER_03  You know, that's what we're producing here.
4313.12 4315.94 SPEAKER_03  It's sort of vaguely similar to the thing.
4315.94 4318.16 SPEAKER_04  Bro Follies, written by Charlie Critter.
4319.32 4319.88 SPEAKER_04  Sorry.
4320.38 4322.88 SPEAKER_04  Charlie Critter writes Bro Follies.
4322.90 4323.34 SPEAKER_04  Internal.
4323.56 4324.70 SPEAKER_04  Elegant Parisian apartment.
4324.82 4325.10 SPEAKER_03  Day.
4325.24 4327.72 SPEAKER_03  Have you ever seen that, like, graffiti across a building?
4327.72 4327.84 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
4328.60 4334.48 SPEAKER_04  Philippe, a wealthy quadriplegic aristocrat, sits in his opulent living room, surrounded by expensive art and furniture.
4334.98 4337.30 SPEAKER_04  He is conducting job interviews for a caregiver.
4337.50 4338.76 SPEAKER_05  Oh, it's in Tuchabla, right.
4338.82 4339.08 SPEAKER_05  Okay.
4339.08 4340.60 SPEAKER_04  Um, yeah.
4340.78 4341.22 SPEAKER_04  Cut to...
4341.22 4342.24 SPEAKER_05  They've called it Bro Follies.
4342.48 4342.86 SPEAKER_04  External.
4343.08 4344.14 SPEAKER_04  Paris streets later.
4344.46 4348.58 SPEAKER_04  Philippe and Dirk roam the streets of Paris.
4348.90 4350.02 SPEAKER_04  How's he roaming the streets?
4350.30 4352.38 SPEAKER_04  A city of lights bustling around them.
4352.74 4354.12 SPEAKER_04  You know, this is...
4354.12 4354.60 SPEAKER_04  What the...
4354.60 4357.16 SPEAKER_04  You haven't even bothered to AI generate something plausible.
4357.34 4364.72 SPEAKER_04  Either you just had it summarized like an Avengers thing that you called Thunder Machines, or you've chosen to do Bro Follies.
4364.72 4375.44 SPEAKER_05  It's a version of Intuchabla where, uh, you know, the old, the old crotchety rich French paraplegic man, like, hires a young black man to be his carer and then discovers that he's just in fact done.
4376.82 4379.34 SPEAKER_05  And there's a lot of boot polish involved.
4379.52 4379.62 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
4379.76 4381.98 SPEAKER_04  Uh, so, writers choose Squibbler worldwide.
4382.24 4386.72 SPEAKER_04  Squibbler is considered to be the best comedy writing software by the world's most creative authors and creators.
4387.16 4392.64 SPEAKER_04  Uh, Alex R., last name not given for good reason, comedy screenwriter, says, Bringing fresh humor to screenwriting is hard.
4392.64 4396.16 SPEAKER_04  Squibbler added unique witty twist to my comedy and made it stand out.
4396.60 4407.34 SPEAKER_03  I mean, if you wanted, like, using this successfully would be the best example you could ask for that, like, much writing for, like, publication is quite literally formulaic, right?
4407.74 4408.32 SPEAKER_04  Oh, of course.
4408.50 4413.14 SPEAKER_04  I mean, like we say, if something can be AI replaced, then it was 99% AI already.
4413.72 4416.08 SPEAKER_04  You know, any human creativity was incidental.
4416.08 4425.14 SPEAKER_04  But what I like is their FAQs and their comedy screenwriting bit says, What makes Squibbler AI comedy scriptwriter software unique?
4425.56 4429.36 SPEAKER_04  Squibbler AI comedy writer software stands out for its specialized focus on comedy writing.
4429.42 4432.04 SPEAKER_04  So also, all of these questions and answers are AI generated.
4432.48 4432.88 SPEAKER_06  Mm-hmm.
4432.90 4433.28 SPEAKER_06  Of course.
4433.36 4436.96 SPEAKER_04  It provides tools for developing humorous narratives, creating witty dialogue, and timing jokes.
4436.96 4445.92 SPEAKER_04  The software assists in identifying comedic potential in situations and characters, and offers guidance for maintaining a consistent tone of humor throughout writing.
4446.24 4449.20 SPEAKER_04  Anyway, it costs $192 annually.
4449.46 4449.96 SPEAKER_04  What?
4450.46 4450.80 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
4450.86 4451.16 SPEAKER_03  Oh, my God.
4451.30 4452.30 SPEAKER_03  I mean, okay, good.
4452.44 4455.46 SPEAKER_03  Tax on people who want to do these things.
4455.86 4457.58 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, it is $192 annually.
4457.76 4461.60 SPEAKER_04  They have a character generator, which I might play around on a little bit later.
4461.84 4462.18 SPEAKER_03  Of course.
4462.18 4462.66 SPEAKER_03  Oh, okay.
4463.04 4463.56 SPEAKER_04  Of course.
4463.56 4466.50 SPEAKER_03  But yeah, because I've actually been using that for some years to generate.
4466.60 4469.76 SPEAKER_03  Every time we've said, like, a guy or name, that's why.
4470.44 4472.22 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, Father McMurphy, that was that.
4472.40 4472.54 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
4472.72 4481.38 SPEAKER_04  Main character, South African mercenary named Jerk Van Der Klerk.
4481.44 4484.68 SPEAKER_04  Let's see what it does when we generate the AI character generator.
4485.14 4485.62 SPEAKER_04  Let's see.
4485.72 4487.14 SPEAKER_04  Okay, it's just using water.
4487.32 4487.88 SPEAKER_04  Okay, here we go.
4488.60 4490.66 SPEAKER_04  Jeremias Van Der Klerk, nicknamed Jerk.
4490.66 4494.18 SPEAKER_04  Jeremiah, or Jerk, as he's known throughout the mercenary circuit, is a complex character.
4494.50 4498.94 SPEAKER_04  He's a ruthless and efficient mercenary, prioritizing self-preservation and profit above all else.
4499.28 4501.46 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, that's unusual for a mercenary.
4501.58 4502.64 SPEAKER_05  He's cynical and sarcastic.
4502.72 4504.26 SPEAKER_04  He is cynical and sarcastic.
4504.60 4506.26 SPEAKER_05  You could describe him as quite mercenary.
4506.94 4507.10 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
4508.66 4514.44 SPEAKER_04  Anyway, anyway, look, I think we've been going for an extra long one for our first episode of the year.
