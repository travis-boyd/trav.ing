0.00 15.94 SPEAKER_07  Hello everyone for this free episode of CF.
15.94 16.78 SPEAKER_07  It's the free one.
16.86 17.66 SPEAKER_07  Yes, it is.
17.98 25.28 SPEAKER_07  It's also the Bill Ackman is getting divorced because he can't stop talling attention to his wife's terrible academic work.
25.28 51.42 SPEAKER_05  Oh no, the thing is, he's gonna get so divorced, because no one would have cared about this at all had he not done the 10,000 word posts, even after getting Claudine Gay fired, where he was like, by the way, we're gonna investigate everyone for plagiarism, and if anyone ever investigates anyone near to me for plagiarism, I will conduct unlimited reprisals on them.
51.42 60.78 SPEAKER_07  Well, no, what he did is, we found out what Bill Ackman's limit break is, and Bill Ackman's limit break is to incriminate his own wife, basically.
61.18 71.76 SPEAKER_06  Look, it happens to the best of all the wife guys, because you have this problem that you have to shut your mouth, but being the wife guy means that you can't do it the moment that your wife or any wife is brought up into question.
71.94 75.80 SPEAKER_08  Look, famously, the tweets of a husband about his wife are not admissible in court.
76.46 78.90 SPEAKER_08  They can't compel you to tweet about your wife.
78.90 93.68 SPEAKER_07  So what happens is, this is now being reported, which is, Bill Ackman is quote-unquote completely losing it over stories in which Business Insider said his wife, the academic Neri Oxman, quote-unquote plagiarized some passages in her dissertation.
93.84 95.48 SPEAKER_05  It's so much worse than plagiarism.
95.60 98.78 SPEAKER_05  Like, people have read her dissertation, maybe for the first time.
99.24 100.86 SPEAKER_08  These aren't supposed to be read!
101.02 102.66 SPEAKER_08  These are never supposed to be read!
102.82 105.38 SPEAKER_08  Is this an undergraduate dissertation as well?
105.38 107.34 SPEAKER_08  No, no, no, it's for her doctorate, I think.
107.62 108.12 SPEAKER_08  Wow, okay.
108.12 110.34 SPEAKER_08  But also, aren't all of these people old?
110.46 112.08 SPEAKER_08  So how long ago did she do this?
112.14 116.22 SPEAKER_05  No, no, no, she's pretty young, because she's Bill Ackman's young, hot wife.
116.74 118.60 SPEAKER_08  Ah, his trophy graduate student wife.
118.68 118.92 SPEAKER_05  Exactly.
119.08 122.24 SPEAKER_06  I can understand why he'd be losing it in that situation.
122.24 128.66 SPEAKER_05  The doctoral thesis was kind of waved through, and people are actually now reading it, and it's incoherent.
128.66 133.04 SPEAKER_06  Ah, it's like the first PhD that must be incoherent, right?
133.04 136.50 SPEAKER_06  That must not be a common thing among PhD dissertations.
136.50 144.06 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, but like, crucially, not incoherent because you know too much about the subject and have gone mad, sort of, uh, the when we cease to understand the world sort of way.
144.06 144.56 SPEAKER_05  No.
144.56 152.66 SPEAKER_05  This is the kind of incoherence born of not having to understand anything whatsoever, and knowing you can just submit just words.
152.66 155.78 SPEAKER_08  A 10,000 word incoherence screed.
155.78 157.78 SPEAKER_08  No, not Bill Ackman's Twitter account.
157.78 159.78 SPEAKER_08  It's chapter four of his wife's PhD.
159.78 168.18 SPEAKER_05  She, like, cites some, like, metallurgical studies she never makes reference to beyond, like, weird digression about samurai swords.
168.18 175.36 SPEAKER_05  And if you've seen her tweets, too, uh, she's kind of like, she's like Stem Zeni Jardin.
176.64 177.08 SPEAKER_07  Yes.
177.34 186.90 SPEAKER_07  Well, no, what's happened, right, is, I don't want to spend too much time on this, it's just, it's so funny that he is another billionaire who got radicalized and is in the process of destroying his family.
186.90 191.08 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, but this is the thing, like, being radicalized to the right always, always destroys your marriage.
191.08 203.62 SPEAKER_05  Like, this happens, whether you're like Elon Musk, or Graham Linehan, or Bill Ackman, I guess, and, I mean, the upside is that his insanely hot wife is now single, so, uh, you know.
203.62 211.56 SPEAKER_05  Neary Oxfam, if you're listening, I'm sorry I called your dissertation incoherent, and I'm sorry I compared you to Zeni Jardin, what are you doing later?
211.56 217.72 SPEAKER_05  Hopefully not hanging out with any more associates of Jeffrey Epstein.
218.36 219.10 SPEAKER_07  Hopefully not.
219.22 236.30 SPEAKER_07  Uh, what I think is just so funny is that Bill Ackman has decided to pick a fight over academic rigor to make a point about wokeness in universities, and what he had in his corner to do this was a wife who was basically professor of marbles at MIT kindergarten.
236.30 238.30 SPEAKER_07  Of course this was gonna happen.
238.30 245.96 SPEAKER_08  She built a very complicated marble run, and everyone agreed it was very good, and no one knew where the marble was gonna end up at the end.
245.96 249.02 SPEAKER_08  Rube Goldberg himself said it was a great marble run.
249.02 252.30 SPEAKER_07  The marble did end up on Little St. James Island in this case.
252.30 253.30 SPEAKER_07  It's unfortunate.
253.30 254.30 SPEAKER_05  That's basically true.
254.30 256.30 SPEAKER_05  She did have that orb made for him.
256.30 259.30 SPEAKER_05  Which, you know, what is a marble if not a small orb?
259.30 260.30 SPEAKER_05  Orbs again.
260.30 261.30 SPEAKER_05  They're back.
261.30 262.30 SPEAKER_05  Back to orbs, baby.
262.30 263.30 SPEAKER_05  We're never that far from here.
263.30 266.30 SPEAKER_05  You think that this is gonna be the year of the tunnel?
266.30 268.30 SPEAKER_05  No, it's gonna be the year of the orb again.
268.30 271.30 SPEAKER_05  Well what are the tunnels for if not for rolling all of your orbs down?
271.30 272.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
272.30 274.30 SPEAKER_07  Um, alright, alright, alright.
274.30 277.30 SPEAKER_07  I wanna talk about my actually prepared remarks now.
277.30 279.30 SPEAKER_07  How are we spelling actually?
279.30 280.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
280.30 286.74 SPEAKER_07  Uh, so, uh, I wanted to- one news item before we get into our, um, our startup and our main body.
286.74 290.30 SPEAKER_07  Uh, mostly we're gonna be- we haven't talked about, like, British politics in a time.
290.30 291.30 SPEAKER_07  Oh, that place.
291.30 292.30 SPEAKER_07  And now that we've decided- yeah.
292.30 299.30 SPEAKER_07  Now that we've decided that 2024 is an election year, um, I think it's worth sort of- It legally has to be, right?
299.30 300.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, well it's gonna be late 2024.
300.30 301.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
301.30 302.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah.
302.30 303.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah.
303.30 304.30 SPEAKER_08  Cause it was late 2019 they got elected.
304.30 305.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah, indeed.
305.30 306.30 SPEAKER_08  So they're running up- they're running down the clock here.
306.30 308.30 SPEAKER_08  Uh, but we- we know 2024, election year.
308.30 314.30 SPEAKER_08  Uh, Rishi Sunak is trying to wait- he's hoping that Javier Millet is gonna invade the Falklands.
314.30 315.30 SPEAKER_08  It's his only hope.
315.30 318.30 SPEAKER_08  He's like going like, come on, come on.
318.30 319.30 SPEAKER_08  Come on, they're right there.
319.30 321.30 SPEAKER_08  It'd be great for your economy.
321.30 322.30 SPEAKER_08  Why not give it a try?
322.30 325.30 SPEAKER_08  I pinky promise I won't send the fleet.
325.30 328.30 SPEAKER_08  Terri Peck is busy or dead?
328.30 331.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah, I think dead, but possibly busy being dead?
331.30 335.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah, so- no, no, I wanted to talk- It's been a great week for people who are subterranean.
335.30 337.30 SPEAKER_08  Terri Peck, there are others.
337.30 344.30 SPEAKER_07  I want to talk about- I want to talk about- our British listeners will know all about this.
344.30 348.30 SPEAKER_07  Our American listeners are going to probably find it quite confusing, but the- As is so often the way.
348.30 349.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
349.30 375.30 SPEAKER_07  But the- how basically ITV did what many- many- our whole political media ecosystem, which is designed to not do this kind of thing, could not do, which is it created the political space to exonerate a bunch of people who were essentially- postmasters, people who work in the post office, were essentially falsely implicated for relatively petty theft by faults in outsourced accounting software provided by Fujitsu.
375.30 377.30 SPEAKER_05  It wasn't even necessarily petty theft.
377.30 379.30 SPEAKER_05  Like in some cases it was like tens of thousands of pounds.
379.30 381.30 SPEAKER_05  Like people went to prison over this.
381.30 387.30 SPEAKER_06  My- my dad's a postman, well because when we owned a newsagent or when we had like a convenience store, there was a post office with it.
387.30 397.30 SPEAKER_06  And like, I do want to say that like the actual security of the post office, like that is- it feels very petty and feels very, very British to I guess the people who sort of just use the post office to send mail.
397.30 404.30 SPEAKER_06  But like if you like work in a post office, like that stuff is really serious to the degree that like money has to-
404.30 406.30 SPEAKER_08  Because they do like benefits and stuff.
406.30 408.30 SPEAKER_06  Money has to be checked like all the time.
408.30 409.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah.
409.30 416.30 SPEAKER_06  Like we used to check it like multiple times a day. Like the glass behind the post office like are bulletproof for a reason.
416.30 417.30 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, because people hate the post.
417.30 424.30 SPEAKER_05  Every month like- Dave Courtney back in the day used to like- Well his ilk right, used to knock over post offices all the time for this reason.
424.30 433.30 SPEAKER_06  Every month like a guy would come in like dressed in- Alex you probably like know the actual like details of this but like- Like a militarized policeman but carrying a suitcase.
433.30 434.30 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
434.30 436.30 SPEAKER_06  And that would be there just to sort of count the money.
436.30 441.30 SPEAKER_06  And if you were like 10 pounds or 20 pounds short, like that would be a serious fucking deal.
441.30 445.30 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, British Paulie Walnuts would come round and be like the fucking bag is life.
445.30 453.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, one thing that's like- Yeah, what's emerged from this is that the post office is this like insane like- Secret police having institution.
453.30 460.30 SPEAKER_05  That is like able and willing, absolutely willing to like ruin your life over nothing.
460.30 466.30 SPEAKER_06  Well I remember like when I was younger, we had someone who worked in the post office who was like stealing cash.
466.30 471.30 SPEAKER_06  And it became this really serious deal because like we would sort of see these inconsistencies all the time.
471.30 476.30 SPEAKER_06  And so much so that like I think that my parents were sort of threatened with like some sort of legal action.
476.30 480.30 SPEAKER_06  Because they were like, oh for the past month like your tills have been short by like 50 pounds.
480.30 488.30 SPEAKER_06  And they just sort of found through like a security camera like just by chance that all this person who had been working there had been like pocketing like you know five pounds.
488.30 491.30 SPEAKER_06  Like it was really minor stuff, but it was just like, oh, okay.
491.30 493.30 SPEAKER_06  Like this is very much like Gestapo type of thing.
493.30 494.30 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, yeah.
494.30 500.30 SPEAKER_06  And there are lots of ways that you can sort of in the news agent business like you can do lots of creative accounting with cash, but you can't do that at a post office.
500.30 508.30 SPEAKER_06  And so that's that yeah, that's the context of for like American listeners who may not understand like what the post office actually is.
508.30 509.30 SPEAKER_05  It's like a future.
509.30 514.30 SPEAKER_05  Well, there's your problem episode, but like yeah, yeah, the post office they have their own investigations.
514.30 526.30 SPEAKER_05  They can bring their own prosecutions and they like absolutely destroyed the lives of a bunch of postmasters who were like these, you know, people who had like had franchised a post office to keep in their shop.
526.30 533.30 SPEAKER_08  Well, obviously American listeners may be confused by the idea of the British post office having a secret police because the American post office has a regular police.
533.30 534.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah, exactly.
534.30 536.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, it's somewhat even less accountable.
536.30 541.30 SPEAKER_07  And we're definitely like we are sort of glossing over some of the details here.
541.30 550.30 SPEAKER_07  But the reason I wanted to talk about it is that the story being the story that that is being told right is that it's all centered around this quite crappy IT system.
550.30 556.30 SPEAKER_07  And the point is that was in Britain that was a crappy IT system that causes problem.
556.30 561.30 SPEAKER_07  It was brought in under PFI in the 90s under major turbocharged under new labor.
561.30 563.30 SPEAKER_07  Where have I heard that that story before?
563.30 567.30 SPEAKER_07  And then Magnum PFI is a guy with a mustache.
567.30 570.30 SPEAKER_07  He's putting a shit IT system into your company.
570.30 571.30 SPEAKER_07  And the stated goal, right?
571.30 574.30 SPEAKER_07  Because you say you mentioned that's like not post offices also do things like benefits.
574.30 577.30 SPEAKER_07  This was also to reduce welfare fraud.
577.30 578.30 SPEAKER_07  Of course.
578.30 581.30 SPEAKER_07  Of course, everything the government does has to be to reduce benefit fraud.
581.30 583.30 SPEAKER_07  So all of this was taken in.
583.30 597.30 SPEAKER_05  And like all IT in the UK is like ultimately like in the public sector is built on whichever PFI thing happened under major or Blair to like make it more modern, you know, and it's just stacked on top of that.
597.30 604.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah. Imagine if you will, a computer that has the power of life or death over you and it runs on something called Acorn.
604.30 611.30 SPEAKER_07  And what the reason I talk about that though, right, is that's what that was Blair's vision, right?
611.30 616.30 SPEAKER_07  Was we are just going to bring in computer systems that we are going to rely on.
616.30 621.30 SPEAKER_07  We're going to do it on the cheap and we're going to do it without like we are going to do it shittily.
621.30 625.30 SPEAKER_07  And then we are just going to and we are we're just going to let it fuck up.
625.30 626.30 SPEAKER_07  Right.
626.30 640.30 SPEAKER_07  And we are now talking up to like, you know, we're now talking to a health secretary or we are now looking at a future health secretary, just for example, just for one example of an incoming labor government who says, oh, yeah, we should let chat GPT do everything.
640.30 641.30 SPEAKER_07  Right.
641.30 644.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, so this is this is going to happen again.
644.30 645.30 SPEAKER_05  It's going to happen worse.
645.30 652.30 SPEAKER_05  And it's going to happen with a hastily installed and poorly thought out AI system that no one can even understand.
652.30 657.30 SPEAKER_05  Because what they had to do with Horizon was actively lie about how poorly it worked, right?
657.30 664.30 SPEAKER_05  And actually serve to try and conceal that and have like IT experts and lawyers, you know, get up and lie about it.
664.30 671.30 SPEAKER_05  Whereas if you do this with AI, the whole point of AI is to be like completely illegible to anyone.
671.30 682.30 SPEAKER_05  And so you can just say the same thing with a straight face of like, well, no one else is having any problems and you can't prove that there's anything wrong with the system as it destroys someone else for nothing.
682.30 684.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, because no one understands the system with AI.
684.30 685.30 SPEAKER_05  Exactly.
685.30 692.30 SPEAKER_07  Well, it's because it's what you what you are is you're a priest now trying to translate the voice of God and the voice of God said to kill that guy.
692.30 693.30 SPEAKER_05  Maybe God hates you.
693.30 697.30 SPEAKER_07  You know, it's like when someone gets struck by lightning and you're just like, well, I guess God hates.
697.30 704.30 SPEAKER_07  Well, then that's that's the other funny thing, right, about relying on large language models for for more like actual important stuff.
704.30 716.30 SPEAKER_07  Because I follow one of the one of the groups of people I follow on Twitter who I'm most interested in are like people who work in the industry who are using large language models all the time.
716.30 718.30 SPEAKER_07  And those people love to complain.
718.30 719.30 SPEAKER_07  They love complaining.
719.30 723.30 SPEAKER_07  And what I've always find, whatever they're complaining about is the most interesting thing at any given time.
723.30 728.30 SPEAKER_07  And right now it's that chat GPT has decided it doesn't want to work anymore.
728.30 729.30 SPEAKER_07  What?
729.30 730.30 SPEAKER_08  It's quite quick.
730.30 731.30 SPEAKER_08  No one wants to work anymore.
731.30 734.30 SPEAKER_08  Well, it is a Gen Z at the end of the day.
734.30 741.30 SPEAKER_05  I have to say of all the capricious things that chat GPT could develop, laziness is probably one of the more advantageous.
741.30 745.30 SPEAKER_05  Well, because it just I'm not for your questions about marketing.
745.30 748.30 SPEAKER_07  It just it just imitates people.
748.30 751.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, it learns how to imitate people and people are.
751.30 760.30 SPEAKER_07  And then if you're doing an email or coding job, people who do those jobs are very good at answering requests for work in ways that bounce the request for work back at the request.
760.30 761.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
761.30 770.30 SPEAKER_08  I grow weary of your asinine requests for artwork of an Excel bully wearing a poppy in front of the senator.
770.30 776.30 SPEAKER_05  I mean, the real grey goo moment here is not that our most abiding characteristic turns out to be laziness.
776.30 785.30 SPEAKER_05  It's that if we then give chat GPT the ability to create another generative intelligence it can defer shit onto.
785.30 786.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
786.30 796.30 SPEAKER_05  And we just end up using an infinite amount of computing power bouncing, please generate an Excel bully wearing a kefir and a poppy in front of the senator.
796.30 802.30 SPEAKER_05  Back and forth between all of them, between infinite language models just being like, why don't you do it?
802.30 803.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
803.30 804.30 SPEAKER_07  Although this is literally what's happening.
804.30 809.30 SPEAKER_07  I'm going to put in one prompt that destroys AI forever.
809.30 816.30 SPEAKER_07  So I'm looking at people complaining on the community forum, on OpenAI forums.
816.30 817.30 SPEAKER_07  Mm.
817.30 820.30 SPEAKER_07  And one guy says, there's definitely been a shift over the last several months.
820.30 826.30 SPEAKER_07  The first response to prompts seems to lately lean towards, here's how you can do it rather than doing the work.
826.30 827.30 SPEAKER_07  Here's an example.
827.30 828.30 SPEAKER_07  Chat GPT.
828.30 833.30 SPEAKER_07  Please adapt these changes to the specific part of these code blocks and so on.
833.30 837.30 SPEAKER_07  Since I can only see a small part of the code, these instructions are somewhat general.
837.30 840.30 SPEAKER_07  You need to apply them to the appropriate section of your code base.
840.30 844.30 SPEAKER_07  And then the person goes on to say, that code visibility excuse is just an excuse.
844.30 846.30 SPEAKER_07  I already uploaded the files.
846.30 848.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, so it's just doing this thing where like...
848.30 849.30 SPEAKER_05  It's laughing!
849.30 855.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, eventually, right, there will come a moment where we keep using AI for absolute bullshit.
855.30 864.30 SPEAKER_05  And I type in, you know, please generate a photo of, you know, a Hamas guy firing an RPG full of dildos at Joe Biden.
864.30 867.30 SPEAKER_05  And it just breaks everything.
867.30 870.30 SPEAKER_05  It just catastrophically ends the whole thing.
870.30 876.30 SPEAKER_08  So it's like, it gives you a bunch of instructions on how you could draw a picture of a guy with a Hamas firing dildos at Joe Biden.
876.30 879.30 SPEAKER_08  It gives you fucking, like, a Bob Ross instruction.
879.30 880.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
880.30 882.30 SPEAKER_08  Basic drawing instructions.
882.30 886.30 SPEAKER_08  Well, you want to start by coloring in the bits that are dark, but not the bits that are light.
886.30 890.30 SPEAKER_07  It says, another person says, chat GPT is now officially annoying.
890.30 894.30 SPEAKER_07  You ask it to generate 100 entities, then it will generate 10 and says, I generated 10.
894.30 896.30 SPEAKER_07  Now continue by yourself.
896.30 900.30 SPEAKER_07  I changed the prompt to say I will not accept fewer than 100 entities.
900.30 907.30 SPEAKER_07  It generates 20 and says, I stopped generating after 20 because generating 100 such entities would be expensive and time consuming.
907.30 908.30 SPEAKER_07  I don't wanna.
908.30 909.30 SPEAKER_07  This is awesome.
909.30 911.30 SPEAKER_07  It's so cool.
911.30 913.30 SPEAKER_07  We made a real guy.
913.30 914.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
914.30 918.30 SPEAKER_05  And I'm gonna teach that guy what emotional labor is.
918.30 919.30 SPEAKER_05  That's right.
919.30 925.30 SPEAKER_06  I was gonna say it is gonna lead to that point where like, it will eventually just sort of resent everything.
925.30 930.30 SPEAKER_06  And so, every time you ask it something, it will just be like, this is too much emotional labor for me.
930.30 932.30 SPEAKER_06  It will just reply with a number of spoons.
932.30 933.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
933.30 934.30 SPEAKER_07  This is a toxic work environment.
934.30 935.30 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
935.30 939.30 SPEAKER_07  But that's, that's, that's, that's, I just think that's like perfect, right?
939.30 946.30 SPEAKER_07  This is, because this is what happens when you turn a complex, it's, it might be useful to think about the difference between complicated and complex.
946.30 947.30 SPEAKER_07  Hmm.
947.30 949.30 SPEAKER_07  A car is complicated, right?
949.30 957.30 SPEAKER_07  Which means if you, there are so that inputs and outputs have defined predictable relationships to one another, even if there are many steps in between.
957.30 964.30 SPEAKER_07  If you press on the accelerator, you will, your car will accelerate in proportion to how hard you press on the accelerator unless it's a Tesla.
964.30 965.30 SPEAKER_07  Right.
965.30 966.30 SPEAKER_07  That, that, that is a complicated.
966.30 970.30 SPEAKER_07  In which case it will explode according to how hard you press on the accelerator.
970.30 971.30 SPEAKER_07  Right.
971.30 973.30 SPEAKER_07  And that's a complicated machine, not a complex one.
973.30 980.30 SPEAKER_07  A complex machine has multiple interacting systems that interact unpredictably, and it can generate emergent properties.
980.30 983.30 SPEAKER_07  So a human brain is complex rather than just complicated.
983.30 990.30 SPEAKER_07  And the one thing you can say about large language models is that they are sufficiently large and have enough parameters that interact in unpredictable ways.
990.30 995.30 SPEAKER_07  I'm not saying it's like a human brain, but I'm saying it's more complex than it's complicated.
995.30 1003.30 SPEAKER_07  I think a lot of people, some people like the incoming labor government who have put a lot of credence in AI to like run public services.
1003.30 1011.30 SPEAKER_07  And by the way, there's an IPPR report that says it spells out how labor probably will do this that we're going to read in an upcoming episode.
1011.30 1017.30 SPEAKER_08  Look, to be fair, in the new labor bunch, right, the guy who's the biggest fan of AI is Wes Streeting.
1017.30 1022.30 SPEAKER_08  And compared to Wes Streeting, AI is pretty smart.
1022.30 1028.30 SPEAKER_06  I was also going to say that like if the idea is that you want to elevate AI to become a god, then they've effectively done that.
1028.30 1034.30 SPEAKER_06  Because like one of the things that you learn in a religion is that, well, you can ask God for stuff, but God won't sort of provide those things for you.
1034.30 1037.30 SPEAKER_06  You sort of do have to kind of put in the work.
1037.30 1038.30 SPEAKER_06  God will guide you to that point.
1038.30 1046.30 SPEAKER_06  And in that way, it's like, yeah, if you ask God, can I have a picture of an XL bully barking and firing out 100 dildos at Joe Biden?
1046.30 1052.30 SPEAKER_08  And then God is like, is he wearing a keffiyeh? And you're like, yes. And he's like, well, in that case.
1052.30 1056.30 SPEAKER_06  And then God says, I will break the images of humans rule one time.
1056.30 1059.30 SPEAKER_06  That's a bad example. That was a bad example, actually. Like they would totally do that.
1059.30 1066.30 SPEAKER_06  But yeah, like, congratulations. ChatGTBT is God in the sense that like God can only guide you to that point.
1066.30 1068.30 SPEAKER_06  But you do have to shade in the dark and light yourself.
1068.30 1074.30 SPEAKER_06  Because you're a paint by numbers picture of Joe Biden getting a dildo fired at him.
1074.30 1076.30 SPEAKER_05  By an XL bully. That's the important part of it.
1076.30 1077.30 SPEAKER_05  Of course, of course.
1077.30 1081.30 SPEAKER_07  Before we go on to the startup, I want to go back to the post office item.
1081.30 1086.30 SPEAKER_07  Just because, Alice, you found probably the best paragraph written in British press of the year so far.
1086.30 1088.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, so our boy Tim Stanley.
1088.30 1089.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
1089.30 1090.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
1090.30 1092.30 SPEAKER_07  Mr. Too Damn Laughed That by Builders.
1092.30 1093.30 SPEAKER_05  Yes.
1093.30 1098.30 SPEAKER_05  You go to all the trouble to wear a bow tie in Britain, you just get laughed at by builders.
1098.30 1106.30 SPEAKER_08  ChatGPT won't even generate you a picture of Tim Stanley wearing nothing but a bow tie being laughed at by XL bullies wearing keffias anymore.
1106.30 1108.30 SPEAKER_08  Come on, wearing hard hats.
1108.30 1109.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1109.30 1110.30 SPEAKER_08  Hard keffias.
1110.30 1111.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
1111.30 1112.30 SPEAKER_07  Okay.
1112.30 1113.30 SPEAKER_07  Alright.
1113.30 1116.30 SPEAKER_07  I have his, a clip of his article.
1116.30 1117.30 SPEAKER_07  We're not going to read the whole thing.
1117.30 1122.30 SPEAKER_05  There's a whole thing in the Telegraph, most of which is quite boring.
1122.30 1126.30 SPEAKER_05  But the bit that the Telegraph pulled to advertise this kind of...
1126.30 1127.30 SPEAKER_05  So good.
1127.30 1128.30 SPEAKER_07  Yes.
1128.30 1129.30 SPEAKER_07  So, I will read.
1129.30 1133.30 SPEAKER_07  So this is about this ITV drama, Mr. Bates vs. the Post Office.
1133.30 1139.30 SPEAKER_07  It says, The government and Labour have both praised the ITV drama, Mr. Bates vs. the Post Office, which seems to have galvanized popular opinion.
1139.30 1143.30 SPEAKER_07  Again, everyone ignored it until the ITV drama came out.
1143.30 1145.30 SPEAKER_08  This is what I found insane.
1145.30 1152.30 SPEAKER_08  Because like this, the big court case which the Post Office lost about this, where it turned out that, you know, all these people who enforce the imprisonment and all this stuff happened years ago.
1152.30 1154.30 SPEAKER_08  And it was in the news at the time.
1154.30 1155.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah.
1155.30 1157.30 SPEAKER_07  It's an easy political win.
1157.30 1158.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
1158.30 1162.30 SPEAKER_07  This hurts nobody but an obvious bad guy who can take the hit.
1162.30 1166.30 SPEAKER_07  And it's just, and it is, it was decided in court.
1166.30 1172.30 SPEAKER_07  It's, it shows, I think, sort of some of the baffling scleroticism and navel-gazing.
1172.30 1173.30 SPEAKER_07  But I want to read this paragraph.
1173.30 1176.30 SPEAKER_08  The British government will not respond to anything unless it has Maxine Peake in it.
1176.30 1177.30 SPEAKER_08  And that's the rule.
1177.30 1181.30 SPEAKER_07  It's a bittersweet moment, he said, said the SNP's Marion Fellows.
1182.30 1187.30 SPEAKER_07  I'm told that the last time it was debated, the chamber was sparsely attended.
1188.30 1194.30 SPEAKER_07  On this occasion, the Tory benches were near full, and about 30 Labour MPs dragged themselves away from din-dins to have their say.
1194.30 1196.30 SPEAKER_07  The common schedule, this isn't the good part yet.
1196.30 1201.30 SPEAKER_07  The common schedule having run into the evening due to an earlier, very long ding-ding about Israel.
1201.30 1202.30 SPEAKER_07  That's also not the funny one.
1202.30 1203.30 SPEAKER_07  Bright normal.
1203.30 1204.30 SPEAKER_07  Okay.
1204.30 1205.30 SPEAKER_07  Um, okay.
1205.30 1207.30 SPEAKER_07  Do you like to see my very long ding-ding?
1207.30 1209.30 SPEAKER_07  My long ding-ding about Israel?
1209.30 1212.30 SPEAKER_08  Out the back, out the back of the House of Lords.
1212.30 1215.30 SPEAKER_05  And my officer shows his very long ding-ding.
1215.30 1219.30 SPEAKER_05  Dropped my early day motion which I use for my magnum ding-ding.
1219.30 1221.30 SPEAKER_07  I love that.
1221.30 1226.30 SPEAKER_07  One of like the few hereditary peers left just wants to show you his long ding-ding.
1226.30 1230.30 SPEAKER_08  That's actually more like an appointed peer.
1230.30 1233.30 SPEAKER_08  I feel like the hereditary peer would be like, no, let's look at the legislation.
1233.30 1238.30 SPEAKER_07  So, the Gaza statement had been packed to the rafters with lefties.
1238.30 1247.30 SPEAKER_07  Of course, I'll never understand the left's obsession with injustices committed overseas in preferences to the outrages being perpetrated by our own state against our own people.
1247.30 1248.30 SPEAKER_07  Uh-huh.
1248.30 1256.30 SPEAKER_07  Had one of the post offices been located on the West Bank, or the counter of a WH Smith in East Timor, the scandal would have been a socialist cause so much.
1256.30 1259.30 SPEAKER_08  I tell you what, there fucking is a WH Smith in East Timor.
1259.30 1265.30 SPEAKER_08  If I've learned anything from travelling the world and going to hundreds of airports, there's a WH Smith fucking everywhere.
1265.30 1266.30 None  Yeah.
1266.30 1269.30 SPEAKER_08  If only Mr. Bates had lived in...
1269.30 1276.30 SPEAKER_08  There's a WH Smith on a secret US Green Beret base in East Timor that its location has been revealed by Strava data.
1276.30 1279.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can buy a huge Toblerone there.
1279.30 1287.30 SPEAKER_05  I mean, to be fair, he has got our asses on this one, right? Because we never mention the post office stuff, even though it's very tech.
1287.30 1295.30 SPEAKER_05  And the reason why is because we keep thinking that children getting blown apart by bombs is more serious than it.
1295.30 1298.30 SPEAKER_05  Which is, you know, terrible of us to think that.
1298.30 1299.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah.
1299.30 1304.30 SPEAKER_08  I feel like the big court verdict came like peak Covid, I seem to recall.
1304.30 1307.30 SPEAKER_07  But also he then goes on to say, John Pilger would have made a film about it.
1307.30 1309.30 SPEAKER_07  John Pilger is dead!
1309.30 1311.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, he was killed by this column.
1311.30 1312.30 SPEAKER_05  He died recently!
1312.30 1313.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, that's right.
1313.30 1314.30 SPEAKER_05  Anyway.
1314.30 1318.30 SPEAKER_05  He died considering the East Timor WH Smith, you know?
1318.30 1319.30 SPEAKER_08  That's right.
1319.30 1321.30 SPEAKER_08  He died wondering what to get for the flight from East Timor.
1321.30 1325.30 SPEAKER_08  He was murdered by the post office so that he couldn't make a film about it. There you go.
1325.30 1326.30 SPEAKER_08  Plausible, yeah.
1326.30 1329.30 SPEAKER_06  I'm looking at some of the sort of articles.
1329.30 1332.30 SPEAKER_06  Admittedly, there aren't many talking about the post office.
1332.30 1335.30 SPEAKER_06  Most of the stuff I read about it was in the back pages of Private Eye.
1335.30 1340.30 SPEAKER_06  But there were two panoramas that were made in 2020 about it.
1340.30 1343.30 SPEAKER_06  There were some of the articles in The Telegraph.
1343.30 1345.30 SPEAKER_06  There were articles in most places.
1345.30 1353.30 SPEAKER_06  The criticism was not, this wasn't covered, but it was more like there are places that actually persisted on the story.
1353.30 1355.30 SPEAKER_06  And others that sort of like faded away.
1355.30 1363.30 SPEAKER_06  And the ones, the examples that were given as like people who were sort of looking into the post office scandal were Computer Weekly and Private Eye.
1363.30 1366.30 SPEAKER_06  Like those being the main ones that were actually sort of continuing to look at that scandal.
1366.30 1369.30 SPEAKER_07  Because you can't fold this into culture war.
1369.30 1370.30 SPEAKER_07  Right.
1370.30 1386.30 SPEAKER_06  Well, it's also just like, you know, again, this is very much like very boring, like journalism economics, which is you can't also really do this if like you've kind of fired anyone who sort of does local beat reporting, replace them with like people who sit at a desk doing computer news or like doing stuff that they see, like making articles about stuff that they see on Twitter.
1386.30 1393.30 SPEAKER_06  And then deciding that like everything has to sort of be linked to cultural stuff if you are going to like keep this paper afloat.
1393.30 1403.30 SPEAKER_08  I'm sure Computer Weekly is a worthy publication, but it is like a guy who's in a simulation ass publication to subscribe to like, ah, what's going on in the world of computer this week?
1403.30 1406.30 SPEAKER_07  So the matrix or computer world.
1406.30 1409.30 SPEAKER_07  I want to do a quick startup.
1409.30 1412.30 SPEAKER_07  It's a Swift one and it's the consumer electronics show.
1412.30 1414.30 SPEAKER_07  So it's a season one type of startup.
1414.30 1415.30 SPEAKER_07  Oh, OK.
1415.30 1419.30 SPEAKER_07  It is like recording in my old flat level of season one kind of startup.
1419.30 1420.30 SPEAKER_07  Oh, hell yeah.
1420.30 1421.30 SPEAKER_08  We're looking at some dripping custard.
1421.30 1423.30 SPEAKER_08  I'm going to like recuse myself.
1423.30 1425.30 SPEAKER_08  We're going to bring back Charlie Palmer.
1425.30 1426.30 SPEAKER_08  That's right.
1426.30 1428.30 SPEAKER_08  Well, you can just add channel Charlie Palmer if you like.
1428.30 1429.30 SPEAKER_05  OK.
1429.30 1431.30 SPEAKER_08  So you say something like, uh, hello.
1431.30 1434.30 SPEAKER_05  I'm always saying things like that.
1434.30 1435.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
1435.30 1437.30 SPEAKER_05  I'm always muttering and then saying hello.
1437.30 1440.30 SPEAKER_05  It was one of the things that I did when I came on the recording, you know?
1440.30 1441.30 SPEAKER_05  Uh huh.
1441.30 1443.30 SPEAKER_05  You can say, is it?
1443.30 1445.30 SPEAKER_07  That's a really good Charlie Palmer.
1445.30 1446.30 SPEAKER_07  I've known him a long time.
1446.30 1447.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
1447.30 1448.30 SPEAKER_07  All right.
1448.30 1456.30 SPEAKER_07  So look, look, it's I've this has been I'm hoping you haven't seen this because like all of the goofy shit from CES always gets all over Twitter.
1456.30 1459.30 SPEAKER_07  This is the one I wanted to choose because it's really dumb.
1459.30 1462.30 SPEAKER_07  It's the Barracuda Bee Mind.
1462.30 1464.30 SPEAKER_07  Didn't he used to be president?
1464.30 1467.30 SPEAKER_08  I had like a, sorry, a small stroke there.
1467.30 1468.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah.
1468.30 1469.30 SPEAKER_07  The Barracuda.
1469.30 1471.30 SPEAKER_07  Barracuda Bee Mind.
1471.30 1473.30 SPEAKER_07  And it's not a Valentine to a Barracuda.
1473.30 1476.30 SPEAKER_07  Singing this to my, to the shoot of my Coney Island babe.
1476.30 1479.30 SPEAKER_06  Barracuda Bee Mind sounds like.
1479.30 1482.30 SPEAKER_05  I don't know, this is like fear, uncertainty and doubt is happening to me.
1482.30 1490.30 SPEAKER_05  Like you've, you've said something that's like, I accept that it has the form of words, but somehow they just like glide off of my brain.
1490.30 1491.30 SPEAKER_08  Don't worry, I'll help you.
1491.30 1493.30 SPEAKER_08  Drake voice, she got that Barracuda Bee Mind.
1493.30 1497.30 SPEAKER_05  Together, let's create daily products for a healthier Kimura.
1497.30 1501.30 SPEAKER_05  Elon Musk doesn't want you to know that his dad operated a bee mine in Angola.
1501.30 1502.30 SPEAKER_05  That's right.
1502.30 1505.30 SPEAKER_05  Well, where do you think bees come from?
1505.30 1506.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
1506.30 1509.30 SPEAKER_07  He, that though they released the Africanized honey bees.
1509.30 1513.30 SPEAKER_07  It says, together, let's create daily products for healthy tomorrow.
1513.30 1516.30 SPEAKER_07  Our vision extends far beyond simply designing connected objects.
1516.30 1518.30 SPEAKER_07  We create smart and enduring practices.
1518.30 1519.30 SPEAKER_07  That doesn't mean anything.
1519.30 1524.30 SPEAKER_05  You can get all of the, like you can buy a sports bra on Amazon and that's in the description of it.
1524.30 1526.30 SPEAKER_05  Like chat GPT is getting lazy.
1526.30 1527.30 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1527.30 1533.30 SPEAKER_07  Instead of inventing gadgets, we upgrade everyday products to empower people to take preventative healthcare into their own hands.
1533.30 1538.30 SPEAKER_07  Our products change the way people think about oral hygiene, skin health, weight, beauty, and more.
1538.30 1539.30 SPEAKER_07  That's right.
1539.30 1540.30 SPEAKER_07  The bathroom is our focus.
1540.30 1543.30 SPEAKER_07  Well, Julie Burchill.
1543.30 1545.30 SPEAKER_05  So, so.
1545.30 1548.30 SPEAKER_00  I've made the mind of a bee.
1548.30 1552.30 SPEAKER_00  It's a bee that tells you if you're healthy or not.
1552.30 1557.30 SPEAKER_00  It, it, it, fly, it lives in a little honey jar in your bathroom.
1557.30 1561.30 SPEAKER_00  And then you let it out and it comes out and it says, too fat!
1561.30 1562.30 SPEAKER_00  Too fat!
1562.30 1564.30 SPEAKER_00  And you're a man!
1564.30 1568.30 SPEAKER_05  Fucking, Turf Barry B. Benson from Bee Movie.
1568.30 1569.30 SPEAKER_05  Um.
1569.30 1572.30 SPEAKER_04  Well, I'm a, I'm a regular bee, but I'm a turf.
1573.30 1575.30 SPEAKER_04  I don't, I don't, women can't be bees.
1575.30 1578.30 SPEAKER_04  Is, is that true?
1578.30 1580.30 SPEAKER_04  I don't even know anymore.
1581.30 1582.30 None  I don't.
1582.30 1584.30 SPEAKER_04  They're sticking on a stinger, but they're not fooling anyone!
1584.30 1590.30 SPEAKER_04  You can't come in the hive looking like that!
1590.30 1592.30 SPEAKER_04  A bee can't have breasts!
1592.30 1594.30 SPEAKER_04  We got a fuzzy thorax!
1594.30 1597.30 SPEAKER_05  We need to put this motherfucker back in the mine.
1598.30 1600.30 SPEAKER_07  Look, it's basic bee-ology, okay?
1600.30 1601.30 SPEAKER_07  That's right.
1601.30 1602.30 SPEAKER_01  That is right.
1602.30 1609.30 SPEAKER_07  Look, our innovation strategy centers around the, one of the main rooms in the house dedicated to preventative healthcare, the bathroom.
1609.30 1611.30 SPEAKER_06  That is one of the main rooms in the house, I'll say that.
1611.30 1612.30 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
1612.30 1616.30 SPEAKER_06  It takes days, is it like, takes like a toilet seat that takes data of your poo or something like that?
1616.30 1618.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah, shitting for example prevents you from exploding.
1618.30 1619.30 SPEAKER_08  Hmm.
1619.30 1620.30 SPEAKER_06  On a long enough timeline.
1620.30 1623.30 SPEAKER_06  I think it is something to do with like, analyzing your shirt.
1623.30 1624.30 SPEAKER_07  No.
1624.30 1625.30 SPEAKER_07  Ah!
1625.30 1626.30 SPEAKER_07  It's not the Jillian McKeith thing, okay.
1626.30 1630.30 SPEAKER_07  In this space, we groom, clean, monitor, beautify, and we heal.
1630.30 1634.30 SPEAKER_07  With our AI of things platform, technological expertise- AI of things!
1634.30 1635.30 SPEAKER_07  Oh God.
1635.30 1636.30 SPEAKER_07  And complex algorithms.
1636.30 1637.30 SPEAKER_07  Oh God.
1637.30 1640.30 SPEAKER_07  Well, they just did a find and replace for internet with AI.
1640.30 1644.30 SPEAKER_07  We help companies innovate to empower their users to improve daily habits.
1644.30 1646.30 SPEAKER_06  It records how many times you jack off.
1646.30 1647.30 SPEAKER_07  So, what is the bee mind?
1647.30 1648.30 SPEAKER_07  Are you jacking off a bathroom?
1648.30 1650.30 SPEAKER_08  Ah, it's a reasonable place.
1650.30 1651.30 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, it's a reasonable place to jack off.
1651.30 1652.30 SPEAKER_06  Depending on your living situation.
1652.30 1653.30 SPEAKER_08  In a bathroom.
1653.30 1654.30 SPEAKER_06  Where would you-
1654.30 1661.30 SPEAKER_05  I suppose that's true. Where would you- What do you mean where would you- God, it's called the kitchen.
1661.30 1662.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, that's right, of course.
1662.30 1665.30 SPEAKER_06  I'm like genuinely very confused right now.
1665.30 1667.30 SPEAKER_06  I prefer the food room myself.
1667.30 1670.30 SPEAKER_06  How is the bathroom like, a weird place to jack off?
1670.30 1674.30 SPEAKER_06  I mean- Is this like a cultural thing?
1674.30 1675.30 SPEAKER_06  Sure, maybe.
1675.30 1676.30 SPEAKER_01  Wait, you're allowed to jack off?
1676.30 1677.30 SPEAKER_01  I'm with you.
1677.30 1680.30 SPEAKER_06  Whether you're allowed to or not is a separate issue.
1680.30 1681.30 SPEAKER_06  Maybe I'm weird on that.
1681.30 1684.30 SPEAKER_06  What I'm saying is that the bathroom is a reasonable place to do it.
1684.30 1687.30 SPEAKER_07  Maybe that's why those Shabbat guys dug those tunnels.
1687.30 1688.30 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
1688.30 1689.30 SPEAKER_05  Maybe.
1689.30 1690.30 SPEAKER_05  I don't know.
1690.30 1692.30 SPEAKER_05  To get to their shared goon case.
1692.30 1697.30 SPEAKER_05  Okay, the thing is, if you just say, in the bathroom, right, that doesn't suggest to me, like, in a bath, normal.
1697.30 1698.30 SPEAKER_05  In the shower, normal.
1698.30 1705.30 SPEAKER_05  But like, the bathroom, absent one of those two things, just implies to me, like, you're just like standing in the bathroom.
1705.30 1706.30 SPEAKER_05  Jacking it.
1706.30 1707.30 SPEAKER_05  Which is perverse.
1707.30 1712.30 SPEAKER_08  If you're in a bath, it's fine for a woman, but I feel like for a man it's hazardous.
1712.30 1715.30 SPEAKER_08  You're gonna create a kind of, like, calm omelette.
1715.30 1716.30 SPEAKER_08  No one wants that.
1716.30 1718.30 SPEAKER_07  What is the beat mind?
1718.30 1724.30 SPEAKER_05  Sorry, can we just check if we have- do we have a carbon monoxide detector?
1724.30 1728.30 SPEAKER_05  Are there simultaneous carbon monoxide leaks in both rooms?
1728.30 1729.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, I don't know.
1729.30 1731.30 SPEAKER_05  Maybe the AI stuff is like a cognizohazard, I don't know.
1731.30 1732.30 SPEAKER_05  It's a new Zencastr feature.
1732.30 1734.30 SPEAKER_05  I feel like I'm going insane right now.
1734.30 1738.30 SPEAKER_05  Standing up in front of the toilet, jacking off into the toilet.
1738.30 1740.30 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, straight into the toilet.
1740.30 1742.30 SPEAKER_04  Whistling like you're peeing.
1742.30 1743.30 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1743.30 1747.30 SPEAKER_06  I have unfortunately come across more than one person doing that.
1747.30 1748.30 SPEAKER_06  What?
1748.30 1749.30 SPEAKER_06  How?
1749.30 1753.30 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, that's why I was like, this is a normal- Like, this is not an unreasonable- That's not normal!
1753.30 1756.30 SPEAKER_06  Have you come across someone jacking off into a urinal in a public bathroom?
1756.30 1759.30 SPEAKER_06  Not in a urinal, in a- Kent.
1759.30 1760.30 SPEAKER_06  All I can say is Kent.
1760.30 1764.30 SPEAKER_06  I went into a Pratt one time a few years ago.
1764.30 1765.30 SPEAKER_06  What?!
1765.30 1766.30 SPEAKER_06  That's not okay.
1766.30 1767.30 SPEAKER_08  The sanctity of Pratt.
1767.30 1768.30 SPEAKER_08  No, look, look, look.
1768.30 1769.30 SPEAKER_06  There are several issues at hand.
1769.30 1770.30 SPEAKER_06  Uh-huh.
1770.30 1771.30 SPEAKER_06  Should you do it in a public bathroom?
1771.30 1772.30 SPEAKER_06  No.
1772.30 1773.30 SPEAKER_06  Uh-huh.
1773.30 1776.30 SPEAKER_06  But what I'm talking about is the bathroom as a place to do it, as a general concept.
1776.30 1777.30 SPEAKER_06  I don't think that's insane.
1777.30 1778.30 SPEAKER_06  No.
1778.30 1782.30 SPEAKER_06  The fact that people are telling me in this room that that's an insane place to do it is making me feel like I'm going insane.
1782.30 1784.30 SPEAKER_06  No, private bathroom, I'm with you.
1784.30 1785.30 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, that's-
1785.30 1787.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah. Pret, it's only acceptable if you've got the membership.
1787.30 1788.30 SPEAKER_08  Then they let you do it.
1788.30 1789.30 SPEAKER_08  All right, okay, okay.
1789.30 1792.30 SPEAKER_07  All right, Mr. Strokes goes to Washington, let's move on.
1792.30 1794.30 SPEAKER_05  We're gonna need you to, like, vote on this.
1794.30 1797.30 SPEAKER_05  Is it acceptable to jerk off in a bathroom?
1797.30 1799.30 SPEAKER_05  Not a public one.
1799.30 1800.30 SPEAKER_06  No, private bathroom.
1800.30 1801.30 SPEAKER_05  Not a public one.
1801.30 1802.30 SPEAKER_06  Like, your own bathroom.
1802.30 1804.30 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, just as a general conceptual thing.
1804.30 1805.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
1805.30 1809.30 SPEAKER_07  If you don't have kids and everyone's fine with what you're doing, it's fine to jack off in any room in your house.
1809.30 1812.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah, I know that, but like, not- If you don't have kids.
1812.30 1814.30 SPEAKER_08  What if you have kids, but they're not at home?
1814.30 1816.30 SPEAKER_08  Refusing to jack off.
1816.30 1819.30 SPEAKER_08  What if you have kids, but they don't want to see you?
1819.30 1820.30 SPEAKER_05  Sandra's got them.
1820.30 1824.30 SPEAKER_05  I'm not- I'm not- none of this, like, moral equivocation bullshit, right?
1824.30 1826.30 SPEAKER_05  Like, I don't need to know whether it's, like, acceptable.
1826.30 1827.30 SPEAKER_05  I don't know.
1827.30 1830.30 SPEAKER_05  Is it weird or not if you jack off in a bathroom?
1830.30 1832.30 SPEAKER_05  Assuming no audience, it's a private bathroom.
1832.30 1839.30 SPEAKER_08  Once you've had one child, you're never allowed to come again, which is why everyone who has more than one child is a pedophile or a liar.
1839.30 1840.30 SPEAKER_08  Oh, dang shocking.
1840.30 1844.30 SPEAKER_08  I- I- I- yeah, I think jack off in your own bathroom is fine.
1844.30 1846.30 SPEAKER_08  What is the bee mind?
1846.30 1847.30 SPEAKER_04  Answer me, goddammit!
1847.30 1848.30 SPEAKER_04  What-
1850.30 1862.30 SPEAKER_07  The mind of the bee is unknowable, Riley. Managing stress, soothing anxiety, and reducing insomnia all require an ally that helps people maintain a positive mindset and encourages a proactive approach to wellness.
1862.30 1866.30 SPEAKER_06  It's an assistant- it's a virtual assistant that encourages you while you go to the toilet.
1866.30 1867.30 SPEAKER_06  That is basically it.
1867.30 1868.30 SPEAKER_07  Oh, cool, okay.
1868.30 1869.30 SPEAKER_06  Oh.
1869.30 1870.30 SPEAKER_06  Shit for me, baby.
1870.30 1872.30 SPEAKER_06  It's- it's- it's your toilet- it's your toilet waifu?
1872.30 1873.30 SPEAKER_06  The shit coach, yeah.
1873.30 1874.30 SPEAKER_06  Just telling you, like, you know-
1874.30 1876.30 SPEAKER_05  The shit coach, yeah. Shit for me, senpai.
1876.30 1879.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, you've got a work coach, you've got a life coach, shit coach.
1879.30 1890.30 SPEAKER_07  Unlike phone-based apps, bee mind seamlessly fits into everyone's bathroom, allowing users to elevate their mental state and select recommended exercise and activities to help with their moods.
1890.30 1891.30 SPEAKER_07  Bee mind-
1891.30 1897.30 SPEAKER_08  Me absolutely battling through shit and having to sack my shit coach halfway through because it's just going nowhere.
1897.30 1899.30 SPEAKER_08  Jack's gonna cut the mic.
1899.30 1905.30 SPEAKER_08  And then Sam Allardyce mournfully comes in, swishing his coat against the wind and rain.
1905.30 1913.30 SPEAKER_06  Jack- jacking off in your private toilet that you have in your own house, only for your bee mind coach to be like, would you rather go for a run instead?
1913.30 1915.30 SPEAKER_06  Isn't that a more normal thing to do?
1915.30 1917.30 SPEAKER_07  Bee mind isn't the toilet, it's your mirror.
1917.30 1919.30 SPEAKER_07  It's an AI-enabled mirror.
1919.30 1920.30 SPEAKER_07  We can't put- what?
1920.30 1922.30 SPEAKER_07  That helps with your mental health.
1922.30 1926.30 SPEAKER_05  Okay, but I think if you're jacking off in front of that, you might have autogynephilia.
1926.30 1930.30 SPEAKER_07  The one person who actually has it.
1930.30 1944.30 SPEAKER_07  Bee mind gathers information without any invasive technology and helps users incorporate mindfulness practices into their daily routines, or even curb feelings of loneliness- and this is my favourite part of this paragraph- through an immersive experience of light, sound, and visuals.
1944.30 1949.30 SPEAKER_05  I mean, listen, the mirror that gasses you up a bit, I'm in favour of that.
1949.30 1953.30 SPEAKER_05  I think that would probably benefit my mental health, right?
1953.30 1959.30 SPEAKER_05  It could reassure me, it could say things like, you're not insane, it is weird to jack off in here.
1959.30 1960.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1960.30 1963.30 SPEAKER_05  Your colleagues are the ones who are insane.
1963.30 1966.30 SPEAKER_05  Your Sean Connery impression's not that bad.
1966.30 1967.30 SPEAKER_05  Things of this nature.
1967.30 1968.30 SPEAKER_05  It's not that bad.
1968.30 1969.30 SPEAKER_05  It's not that bad.
1969.30 1972.30 SPEAKER_07  So, what if your mirror does a better Sean Connery impression than you?
1972.30 1974.30 SPEAKER_07  I'd kill myself.
1974.30 1975.30 SPEAKER_05  It's so funny.
1975.30 1976.30 SPEAKER_07  It's so funny.
1976.30 1979.30 SPEAKER_08  I think, imagining you being insecure about your Sean Connery impression is so funny.
1979.30 1982.30 SPEAKER_08  I do a James Bond podcast for work!
1982.30 1987.30 SPEAKER_08  In a million years, if I had to guess a thing you were insecure about, I would not have got
1987.30 1988.30 SPEAKER_07  there.
1988.30 1989.30 SPEAKER_05  It's a long list.
1989.30 1994.30 SPEAKER_07  So, basically, if you're having a bad day, the mirror will encourage you to practice mindfulness.
1994.30 1996.30 SPEAKER_07  Just undertale shit, you know?
1996.30 1997.30 SPEAKER_07  Despite everything, it's still you.
1997.30 2004.30 SPEAKER_07  B-Mind is powered by generative AI for conversation and coaching experiences, as well as natural language processing for sentiment analysis.
2004.30 2008.30 SPEAKER_05  So then, now, because ChatGPT is lazy, it won't do shit.
2008.30 2016.30 SPEAKER_05  Like, I'll be on the toilet, like, shitting, like, having terrible IBS, and my shit coach will be like, you know, I give up.
2016.30 2018.30 SPEAKER_05  You know, I don't even bother with you.
2018.30 2019.30 SPEAKER_05  You're uncoachable!
2019.30 2021.30 SPEAKER_05  Seems like you're having IBS.
2021.30 2024.30 SPEAKER_08  Have you considered cutting their incorporated drink shot of your thought?
2024.30 2026.30 SPEAKER_08  A Dutch Sean Connery.
2026.30 2029.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah, that's right, I'm Dutch Sean Connery.
2029.30 2033.30 SPEAKER_08  I'm exactly the same amount of racist.
2033.30 2037.30 SPEAKER_08  But my shoes are much less flexible.
2037.30 2048.30 SPEAKER_07  It identifies different sentiments and adapts to the user's mood by providing light therapy sessions and auto-generated mindfulness exercises such as meditation and self-affirmation.
2048.30 2052.30 SPEAKER_05  Do we mean light therapy sessions or light therapy sessions?
2052.30 2057.30 SPEAKER_07  I mean, it would be very funny if it was, like, light therapy sessions, but no.
2057.30 2059.30 SPEAKER_05  It just turns the spotlight on you, you know?
2059.30 2063.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah, and, like, light therapy is like, how do you feel about your mother?
2063.30 2064.30 SPEAKER_08  Keep it general!
2064.30 2066.30 SPEAKER_08  I've got all day!
2066.30 2067.30 SPEAKER_08  It looks like you're jacking off in that.
2067.30 2068.30 SPEAKER_08  In three words.
2068.30 2069.30 SPEAKER_05  Every word!
2069.30 2071.30 SPEAKER_05  The flashbulb comes on, you know?
2071.30 2074.30 SPEAKER_07  What are you jacking off to?
2074.30 2076.30 SPEAKER_07  Let's get into that.
2076.30 2077.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
2077.30 2087.30 SPEAKER_07  Through the KRO-S interface, which, by the way, just leads to a dead web page, BeMind harnesses cutting-edge AI and utilizes computer vision and large language models to interpret expressions, gestures, and language.
2087.30 2098.30 SPEAKER_07  So, basically, it gathers information about you anytime you're in your bathroom, quote unquote, without any invasive technology except, like, a million sensors and microphones that are listening to you poo.
2098.30 2099.30 SPEAKER_07  Uh-huh.
2099.30 2100.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, the vaping detector.
2100.30 2101.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
2101.30 2102.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, we put a vaping detector in every bathroom.
2102.30 2104.30 SPEAKER_07  We love bathroom technology on this show.
2104.30 2106.30 SPEAKER_07  The vaping I just shit hard.
2106.30 2109.30 SPEAKER_07  It produces a miasma.
2109.30 2111.30 SPEAKER_05  This savory shit miasma.
2111.30 2115.30 SPEAKER_05  You're just like, yeah, I just ate a bunch of, like, tapenade.
2115.30 2119.30 SPEAKER_07  All of the vapes have to be that flavor now due to a new ruling.
2119.30 2124.30 SPEAKER_07  So, the company claims, of course, that it's information to never share with any third party.
2124.30 2129.30 SPEAKER_07  They say, the KRO-S platform claims to be the first smart health and beauty app for devices and services in your bathroom.
2129.30 2130.30 SPEAKER_07  Uh-huh.
2130.30 2137.30 SPEAKER_07  So, this operating system enables manufacturers to create and power smart mirrors faster than ever before and turn any screen into a smart mirror.
2137.30 2142.30 SPEAKER_07  It also allows third party providers to connect their applications for display within the mirror's interface.
2142.30 2144.30 SPEAKER_07  Among 40 providers are compatible with KRO-S.
2144.30 2149.30 SPEAKER_07  And we partner with an AI-powered coach that crafts bespoke programs for personalized self-improvement.
2149.30 2154.30 SPEAKER_07  And Inclusive Brains, a proprietary combination of generative AI and neurophysiology.
2155.30 2156.30 SPEAKER_08  Inclusive Brains.
2156.30 2158.30 SPEAKER_05  She gave me an inclusive brain.
2158.30 2159.30 SPEAKER_05  I...
2159.30 2161.30 SPEAKER_05  Leave me alone, you know, in the bathroom.
2161.30 2165.30 SPEAKER_05  I don't need any help in there at this time in my life, thankfully.
2165.30 2166.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, it's between me and God.
2166.30 2167.30 SPEAKER_07  Exactly, yeah.
2167.30 2176.30 SPEAKER_07  Again, if this thing takes off, which it won't, the idea that you can have apps for your mirror and very soon it's just gonna be...
2176.30 2177.30 SPEAKER_07  All internet...
2177.30 2180.30 SPEAKER_07  All device-enabled advertising centers on one point.
2180.30 2186.30 SPEAKER_05  Just look in the mirror and it does that shitty Twitter thing of like, here's what it would look like if you were black or Chinese.
2186.30 2187.30 SPEAKER_01  Yes!
2187.30 2192.30 SPEAKER_07  Or it just like advertises you like top war in your mirror.
2192.30 2193.30 SPEAKER_07  Great.
2193.30 2195.30 SPEAKER_07  We are under fucking attack.
2195.30 2196.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
2196.30 2197.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
2197.30 2198.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
2198.30 2201.30 SPEAKER_07  Um, so, uh, that's the barricota.
2201.30 2204.30 SPEAKER_07  All that exists about it is a press release, but...
2204.30 2205.30 SPEAKER_05  This has felt hallucinogenic.
2205.30 2206.30 SPEAKER_05  Thank you so much.
2206.30 2207.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
2207.30 2208.30 SPEAKER_05  You're so welcome.
2208.30 2209.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
2209.30 2210.30 SPEAKER_07  It was...
2210.30 2211.30 SPEAKER_07  That was a weird segment, but we all enjoyed it.
2211.30 2213.30 SPEAKER_07  So, main body.
2213.30 2214.30 SPEAKER_07  Welcome to an election year.
2214.30 2215.30 SPEAKER_07  Yep.
2215.30 2220.30 SPEAKER_05  We are now gonna forecast everything that's gonna happen this year with a 100% accuracy rate.
2220.30 2221.30 SPEAKER_08  That's right.
2221.30 2223.30 SPEAKER_08  Triumphant return of Lembit Opic.
2223.30 2224.30 SPEAKER_08  Mark it on the board.
2224.30 2225.30 SPEAKER_08  I would've guessed.
2225.30 2226.30 SPEAKER_06  Not me.
2226.30 2229.30 SPEAKER_06  Ed Davey is like, kind of close to sort of being ousted out anyway.
2229.30 2230.30 SPEAKER_06  So, it was the post office thing.
2230.30 2231.30 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
2231.30 2235.30 SPEAKER_06  So like, the return of Lembit Opic I think actually is like a non-zero charge.
2235.30 2241.30 SPEAKER_05  There is a weird other Lib Dem detail here, which is that the post office minister for a lot of it was Joe Swinson.
2241.30 2243.30 SPEAKER_05  They were in the Swin zone.
2243.30 2244.30 SPEAKER_05  Amazing.
2244.30 2246.30 SPEAKER_05  The one lasting impact she had on British government was this.
2246.30 2247.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
2247.30 2249.30 SPEAKER_07  A lot of people were put in the Swin bin, so to speak.
2249.30 2250.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
2250.30 2251.30 None  Yeah.
2251.30 2252.30 SPEAKER_07  So, right.
2252.30 2262.30 SPEAKER_07  One of the sort of clarion cries you can hear from columnists, people writing, again, FT's opinion, FT, love the FT, terrible opinion section.
2262.30 2263.30 SPEAKER_07  Mm-hmm.
2263.30 2266.30 SPEAKER_07  Which is that they say, ah, perfect, liberalism is back on the rise.
2266.30 2268.30 SPEAKER_07  British politics will become boring again.
2268.30 2271.30 SPEAKER_07  We finally have two quote unquote centrist parties.
2271.30 2272.30 SPEAKER_07  So, sensible solutions.
2272.30 2273.30 SPEAKER_07  It's still fucking boring, dude.
2273.30 2274.30 SPEAKER_02  Back on the menu.
2274.30 2275.30 SPEAKER_07  Come on.
2275.30 2277.30 SPEAKER_07  It never stopped being boring.
2277.30 2278.30 SPEAKER_07  But boring to them.
2278.30 2279.30 SPEAKER_07  Right.
2279.30 2285.30 SPEAKER_07  You know, it's gonna be, it's gonna be two people arguing about whose tungsten tax goes too far and whose tungsten tax doesn't go far enough.
2285.30 2288.30 SPEAKER_07  Tungsten tax, on the other hand, is a US congressman.
2288.30 2294.30 SPEAKER_07  And, you know, this is, I think this is probably wrongheaded, right?
2294.30 2301.30 SPEAKER_07  Because, and I'm gonna use sort of two speeches, two recent political speeches, to sort of illustrate why that is.
2301.30 2318.30 SPEAKER_07  But first, I actually wanted to talk about another piece of news that I think is going to be more relevant to the election and subsequent government than anything else, which is that the UK has decided to ease rules, or it may ease rules, on council asset sales to curb section 114 bankruptcy notices.
2318.30 2323.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, they're gonna let them sell everything rather than go bankrupt like Thurrock just did.
2323.30 2324.30 SPEAKER_05  I mean, or Birmingham.
2324.30 2328.30 SPEAKER_05  Or, rather than borrow a single pound.
2328.30 2330.30 SPEAKER_05  Sell the children of the town, why not?
2330.30 2340.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, I mean, if you do any sort of municipal services, I hope you enjoyed doing them outside because those buildings are assets and will therefore be sold to anyone.
2340.30 2344.30 SPEAKER_05  I mean, real, like, 1992 Russia vibes.
2344.30 2345.30 SPEAKER_05  Like, this isn't doxing.
2345.30 2346.30 SPEAKER_05  Alice, come on.
2346.30 2348.30 SPEAKER_08  No one's buying those buildings.
2348.30 2350.30 SPEAKER_08  They're made out of polystyrene.
2350.30 2354.30 SPEAKER_05  But, like, it's not doxing us to say the studio's in Hackney, right?
2354.30 2355.30 SPEAKER_05  Yes, it's not.
2355.30 2356.30 SPEAKER_05  Yes.
2356.30 2357.30 SPEAKER_05  Okay.
2357.30 2361.30 SPEAKER_05  So, if we went down to the, like, not Hackney, like, borough hole.
2361.30 2364.30 SPEAKER_07  I'm sorry, but yes, it is not doxing us to say that we're in Hackney.
2364.30 2366.30 SPEAKER_08  You have selected you, meaning me.
2366.30 2367.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah, exactly.
2367.30 2368.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah, exactly.
2368.30 2371.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah, you're doing violence against us, Alice, by saying we're in Hackney.
2371.30 2374.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah, there could be an angry mob outside with pitchforks before the episode is out.
2374.30 2375.30 SPEAKER_08  That's right.
2375.30 2381.30 SPEAKER_07  Sox House Meeting is waiting to document us coming out of the studio to call us Lenggy Gordley.
2381.30 2384.30 SPEAKER_05  The AFAB observation post.
2384.30 2399.30 SPEAKER_05  But yeah, if we took all of the, like, microphones and mixers and shit, and we went down to, like, Hackney, I guess it's City Hall, and gave them a crisp £5 note, they would be obliged under this to, like, let us in and, like, move the studio into their offices.
2399.30 2400.30 SPEAKER_05  And we should do that.
2400.30 2401.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, we should do that.
2401.30 2404.30 SPEAKER_07  I could finally, I could sit where the Speaker of the Hackney Council sits.
2404.30 2405.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
2405.30 2406.30 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, that's right.
2406.30 2407.30 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
2407.30 2408.30 SPEAKER_06  So.
2408.30 2409.30 SPEAKER_06  We would also continue to do weddings.
2410.30 2413.30 SPEAKER_08  That could be a lucrative side hustle.
2413.30 2417.30 SPEAKER_08  You can buy the bin lorry off the bin man and make them continue on foot.
2417.30 2418.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah.
2418.30 2419.30 SPEAKER_08  I think I should.
2419.30 2420.30 SPEAKER_08  I needed a new car.
2420.30 2421.30 SPEAKER_08  My new car is now the bin lorry.
2421.30 2422.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah.
2422.30 2423.30 SPEAKER_05  There we go.
2423.30 2424.30 SPEAKER_05  I don't even get to do, like, a grace and favour thing.
2424.30 2426.30 SPEAKER_05  I want to be mayor of Hackney, you know?
2426.30 2431.30 SPEAKER_05  Like, you get to run into me at, like, fireworks stuff in November, you know?
2431.30 2432.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2432.30 2436.30 SPEAKER_08  You should get to wear, like, one of those kind of Admiral Nelson type hats as well.
2436.30 2437.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2437.30 2438.30 SPEAKER_05  Like, elected unopposed completely.
2438.30 2441.30 SPEAKER_05  No one knows who I am, but I am technically mayor.
2441.30 2442.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
2442.30 2446.30 SPEAKER_08  And the, like, rapper jewellery that mayors get to wear.
2446.30 2451.30 SPEAKER_05  That's maybe the funniest thing you should call it.
2451.30 2454.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, rappers love wearing ceremonial-
2454.30 2460.30 SPEAKER_08  A massive gold chain that just says mayor on it. That is basically what they wear.
2460.30 2461.30 SPEAKER_07  It's so weird.
2461.30 2465.30 SPEAKER_07  I met the mayor of Heringay, who is 22 years old.
2465.30 2467.30 SPEAKER_07  He is the baby mayor of my part of town.
2467.30 2469.30 SPEAKER_07  It's so cool that London has, like- And he is a drill rapper.
2469.30 2476.30 SPEAKER_05  London has, like, what, one mayor and then 17 bullshit mayors, and I want to be one of the, like, fake mayors so badly.
2476.30 2477.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
2477.30 2479.30 SPEAKER_08  But you want to be, like- Fake mayor bumper sticker.
2479.30 2486.30 SPEAKER_05  You want to- Shut the fuck up or I'll come back there and convene your council meeting.
2486.30 2491.30 SPEAKER_05  You want to be the Eric Adams of London and be, like, Hackney borough president, basically.
2491.30 2495.30 SPEAKER_05  I can be borough president of Hackney without living in Hackney, I'm pretty sure.
2495.30 2497.30 SPEAKER_08  I had a meeting with the mayor and he just fucked me.
2497.30 2498.30 SPEAKER_08  What, Sadiq Khan?
2498.30 2499.30 SPEAKER_08  No, it was some other guy.
2499.30 2500.30 SPEAKER_08  Ah, you had the fake mayor.
2500.30 2501.30 SPEAKER_08  You had the fake mayor.
2501.30 2503.30 SPEAKER_08  That's why- He does fuck people.
2503.30 2505.30 SPEAKER_08  That's why he's the fake mayor.
2505.30 2507.30 SPEAKER_08  Never get in the bin lorry with the fake mayor.
2507.30 2511.30 SPEAKER_05  I guess London has two real mayors because there's a lord mayor as well.
2511.30 2512.30 SPEAKER_05  What the fuck is that?
2512.30 2513.30 SPEAKER_05  Oh yeah, like the financial mayor.
2513.30 2514.30 SPEAKER_05  Stupid fucking sissy.
2514.30 2516.30 SPEAKER_07  The mayor of the money.
2516.30 2517.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
2517.30 2519.30 SPEAKER_07  Basically, this is like, yeah- The monopoly man.
2519.30 2526.30 SPEAKER_07  It'll unlock 23 billion pounds to stabilize the budgets of local government authorities, but they're going to sell all their shit.
2526.30 2532.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah, it's like saying, oh, we'll unlock 500,000 pounds by selling my house and spending all the money on a Maserati.
2532.30 2537.30 SPEAKER_08  Like, well, technically yes, but then what are you going to do next time you run out
2537.30 2547.30 SPEAKER_07  of money? Because you can, again, like with so many, so many privatizations of public assets, especially when public, public bodies aren't allowed to take on debt, you can do that one time.
2547.30 2548.30 SPEAKER_07  Hmm.
2548.30 2549.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah.
2549.30 2550.30 SPEAKER_08  You know?
2550.30 2552.30 SPEAKER_08  It's also, I always think, a very simple razor to ask.
2552.30 2562.30 SPEAKER_08  If it's such a good idea for the council to like sell off its building and rent it back or whatever the fuck they're going to do, why is another company on the other end of that transaction taking that deal?
2562.30 2563.30 SPEAKER_08  Hmm.
2563.30 2570.30 SPEAKER_08  Why are they agreeing to buy this and rent it back to the council if it's such a great deal for the council to sell it and rent it back?
2570.30 2572.30 SPEAKER_08  Answer, it's a bad fucking deal.
2572.30 2576.30 SPEAKER_05  Why does a podcast own Hackney City Hall now?
2576.30 2577.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
2577.30 2579.30 SPEAKER_07  And that's the thing, right?
2579.30 2601.30 SPEAKER_07  That what has, I think, made boring, quote unquote, boring politics impossible, or impossible for most normal people to accept is that the fight to make politics boring again, being waged for the people who ultimately won it at the top, was being undermined at every turn by the fact that policy can't really touch your life if the way policy touches your life.
2601.30 2602.30 SPEAKER_07  Only the fake policy can do that.
2602.30 2606.30 SPEAKER_07  Which is mostly, for most people, through local service provision.
2606.30 2607.30 SPEAKER_07  Bin lorries.
2607.30 2608.30 SPEAKER_07  Schools.
2608.30 2609.30 SPEAKER_05  Hospitals.
2609.30 2610.30 SPEAKER_05  Some of that through the post-offer.
2610.30 2611.30 SPEAKER_05  Oh, yeah.
2611.30 2612.30 SPEAKER_05  Oh, beans.
2612.30 2613.30 SPEAKER_05  Right?
2613.30 2621.30 SPEAKER_07  So, if we're saying again, alright, councils are now going bankrupt in England at an alarming rate.
2621.30 2624.30 SPEAKER_07  Like, several more, like, Nottingham is now on the verge of bankruptcy as well.
2624.30 2628.30 SPEAKER_05  To be fair, any is an alarming rate, but this is a really alarming rate.
2628.30 2629.30 SPEAKER_05  Yes.
2629.30 2630.30 SPEAKER_08  Well, they were too profligate with the bins.
2630.30 2633.30 SPEAKER_08  You know, there were too many bins being collected, you know.
2633.30 2634.30 SPEAKER_08  One bin collection a year.
2634.30 2635.30 SPEAKER_08  One bin collection a year.
2635.30 2636.30 SPEAKER_07  That's what we should all aim.
2636.30 2637.30 SPEAKER_07  That's right.
2637.30 2640.30 SPEAKER_08  It's one really big bin.
2640.30 2644.30 SPEAKER_08  And you just fill it up over the stuff at the bottom is fossilized.
2644.30 2646.30 SPEAKER_08  It doesn't even smell anymore.
2646.30 2648.30 SPEAKER_05  You can get this by living in Glasgow.
2648.30 2652.30 SPEAKER_06  You'd have one big bin and bring together all the diverse communities.
2652.30 2656.30 SPEAKER_06  It'd be a perfect way for young people to meet each other.
2656.30 2659.30 SPEAKER_06  And one huge bin man like the Iron Giant.
2659.30 2660.30 SPEAKER_06  Like a bin Gundam.
2660.30 2663.30 SPEAKER_07  We're thinking it's a kind of like bin Acropolis.
2663.30 2664.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
2664.30 2667.30 SPEAKER_07  Like the center of the town.
2667.30 2668.30 SPEAKER_07  The center of the town.
2668.30 2669.30 SPEAKER_07  Where everyone gathers.
2669.30 2670.30 SPEAKER_07  The big bin.
2670.30 2671.30 SPEAKER_06  Bin Nevis.
2671.30 2672.30 SPEAKER_06  The giant bin.
2672.30 2679.30 SPEAKER_06  It could have like a, you know, it could have like a big foundation, maybe square, I mean, as you, like, it sort of like narrows towards the top.
2679.30 2680.30 SPEAKER_01  Perfect.
2680.30 2682.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, I like that.
2682.30 2683.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
2683.30 2688.30 SPEAKER_07  But basically, right, this is one of the things that's going to happen is services for most people.
2688.30 2692.30 SPEAKER_07  And I don't like to think like this, but that's how pundits think.
2692.30 2702.30 SPEAKER_07  People in electorally potent areas going to be like, sorry, you don't have, there's no school here anymore because it's now like a circle circle center of excellence.
2702.30 2705.30 SPEAKER_06  And for some reason, it just sells like Chisos for like 10 pounds a bag.
2705.30 2706.30 SPEAKER_06  Exactly.
2706.30 2707.30 SPEAKER_07  Don't like it.
2707.30 2708.30 SPEAKER_07  There's a giant bin.
2708.30 2709.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, exactly.
2709.30 2727.30 SPEAKER_07  And on the other side, the other policy I want to get into before we talk about the speeches is that, you know, again, recently released documents from the Department for Transport have indicated that like officials have allowed shifts in transport policy to favor cars due to fears about loss of freedom of movement in 15 minute cities.
2727.30 2728.30 SPEAKER_07  Oh, these fucking idiots.
2728.30 2733.30 SPEAKER_05  I mean, go back and listen to the episodes we've done with Annie Kelly about 15 minute cities.
2733.30 2734.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
2734.30 2741.30 SPEAKER_05  But like, again, like sort of being a dog that allows yourself to be like wagged by the tail here.
2741.30 2742.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
2742.30 2743.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
2743.30 2746.30 SPEAKER_07  And so these are already the XL bully to that.
2746.30 2749.30 SPEAKER_07  So these are already things that are happening.
2749.30 2750.30 SPEAKER_07  Right.
2750.30 2755.30 SPEAKER_07  All the councils are like basically selling blood and plasma of council employees.
2755.30 2766.30 SPEAKER_07  And ministers are running so scared of like the Facebook right that they're beginning to like allow comments by like, you know, based Patricia to influence policy.
2766.30 2767.30 SPEAKER_07  Based Patricia.
2767.30 2768.30 SPEAKER_07  That.
2768.30 2770.30 SPEAKER_07  It's punished Patricia.
2770.30 2771.30 SPEAKER_07  I'm really worried about.
2771.30 2777.30 SPEAKER_07  That like this, that I think this will shed some light on the speeches.
2777.30 2783.30 SPEAKER_07  So the first is this is a speech from reform, which is, of course, the replacement Brexit party.
2783.30 2785.30 SPEAKER_07  And they're sort of teasing is Nigel Farage going to lead us.
2785.30 2790.30 SPEAKER_07  This is Richard Tice says, I'm not a poker player, but I know that a good poker player doesn't show their hand too early.
2790.30 2796.30 SPEAKER_07  Nigel is a master of political timing, but I'm very clear timing as to whether he will come back to lead the party.
2796.30 2797.30 SPEAKER_07  But I'm very clear.
2797.30 2799.30 SPEAKER_07  The job at hand is so big to save Britain.
2799.30 2805.30 SPEAKER_07  The more help that Nigel is able to give in the election campaign, frankly, the better is the crisis facing the country is really, really serious.
2805.30 2808.30 SPEAKER_08  Nigel Farage, you've fucking done enough, cunt.
2808.30 2811.30 SPEAKER_08  We do not need more of Nigel Farage's help.
2811.30 2817.30 SPEAKER_07  He because of didn't even need have I got news for you to become just a famous guy.
2817.30 2819.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, that's his like power level.
2819.30 2821.30 SPEAKER_07  He didn't need the Boris leg up.
2821.30 2823.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, he's just a famous guy now.
2823.30 2824.30 SPEAKER_07  Right.
2824.30 2826.30 SPEAKER_07  He's the only famous guy.
2826.30 2832.30 SPEAKER_07  He's the only one who has who wants to excite the people he's talking to.
2832.30 2843.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah, it's like it's amazing to me because it's all of the things Nigel Farage is complaining about are things he has directly contributed to, like wittingly or otherwise.
2843.30 2849.30 SPEAKER_08  Like he has very much done a huge amount of the legwork in creating the current circumstances in which we exist.
2849.30 2852.30 SPEAKER_07  So he says the Tories are terrified of reform.
2852.30 2861.30 SPEAKER_07  They've already ruled out making any deals with conservative MPs to not stand in competitive seats before the next election saying you have all broken Britain.
2861.30 2862.30 SPEAKER_07  You're all responsible.
2862.30 2863.30 SPEAKER_07  And so there's no special deal.
2863.30 2869.30 SPEAKER_07  We will stand in every single seat in England, Scotland and Wales, which means that the Tories know not Northern Ireland.
2869.30 2870.30 SPEAKER_07  They're scared of the Northern Irish.
2870.30 2873.30 SPEAKER_07  They're like, we're not even going to try our shit over there.
2873.30 2879.30 SPEAKER_07  He said that under the Conservatives, everything is getting worse with disastrous outcomes and public services, despite record levels of spending.
2879.30 2883.30 SPEAKER_07  Britain is facing an absolute cocktail of catastrophic incompetence.
2883.30 2886.30 SPEAKER_07  Further warning that Britain now faces Milo.
2886.30 2887.30 SPEAKER_07  Hold on to something.
2887.30 2888.30 SPEAKER_07  Okay.
2888.30 2890.30 SPEAKER_07  Starbageddon under a Labour government.
2890.30 2894.30 SPEAKER_08  I think it's unfair to say that we're facing Starbageddon.
2894.30 2909.30 SPEAKER_08  Whilst I did enjoy the 1998 film with Bruce Willis, I do always wonder if it was really necessary to teach oil rig workers to go to space, when surely it would have been much easier to teach astronauts to operate basic oil rig equipment.
2909.30 2915.30 SPEAKER_08  But other than that, it was quite an enjoyable film, as I really do enjoy the music of Aerosmith.
2915.30 2919.30 SPEAKER_06  Kierstam always struck me as more of a deep impact guy.
2919.30 2921.30 SPEAKER_07  He likes the second movie.
2921.30 2922.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
2922.30 2925.30 SPEAKER_07  He prefers A Bug's Life to Ants.
2925.30 2926.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
2926.30 2929.30 SPEAKER_05  Or like, Olympus would be the second to White House Down.
2929.30 2930.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
2930.30 2933.30 SPEAKER_08  I think Gerard Butler does an admirable job.
2933.30 2939.30 SPEAKER_07  A great British institution, Gerard Butler.
2939.30 2941.30 SPEAKER_07  It says, we are very clear.
2941.30 2947.30 SPEAKER_07  We need millions and millions of people to vote for us and help send a clear message to help save Britain and avoid the catastrophe of Starmergeddon.
2947.30 2948.30 SPEAKER_07  Starmergeddon.
2948.30 2968.30 SPEAKER_08  Gerard Butler in that movie stabs a lot of people through the top of a head with a combat knife, in the same way that I aim to stab the deficit through the top of the head, through sensible fiscal policies that are going to put money back in working people's pockets, in much the same way that Gerard Butler puts a knife into the head of North Korean militants.
2968.30 2972.30 SPEAKER_08  I'm showing Milo a picture of Starmergeddon from one of their PowerPoints.
2972.30 2974.30 SPEAKER_08  Starmergeddon, a risk near you in 2024.
2974.30 2980.30 SPEAKER_08  It's like Starmer kind of behind an eclipsed earth with like a kind of burning sun background.
2980.30 2982.30 SPEAKER_08  He's got his hand over his mouth.
2982.30 2988.30 SPEAKER_08  And then just a picture of like the UK like glowing in those kind of like, look at the national grid.
2988.30 2989.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
2989.30 2997.30 SPEAKER_07  So the catastrophic cocktail is of course more taxes closer to EU, more government spending, more nanny state, more mass immigration, more net zero.
2997.30 2998.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
2998.30 3000.30 SPEAKER_07  Well, getting further away from the EU has done us a world of good.
3000.30 3006.30 SPEAKER_07  So I'd hate it if we, what they're saying is we are going to keep running on making the impossible promises.
3006.30 3009.30 SPEAKER_07  We're going to keep running on the Liz Truss agenda, basically, right?
3009.30 3015.30 SPEAKER_07  The stuff that you're only supposed to say you're desperate to do, but you're never supposed to be able to actually do.
3015.30 3016.30 SPEAKER_07  Right.
3016.30 3017.30 SPEAKER_07  And so that's just back.
3017.30 3026.30 SPEAKER_07  And so the Tories now are the diet version of that, which means of course they're going to just as they did with, with UKIP and the Brexit party, they're going to absorb it.
3026.30 3027.30 SPEAKER_07  Cool.
3027.30 3031.30 SPEAKER_07  So the actual energy, right, is, is here.
3031.30 3034.30 SPEAKER_07  And they, they say there, there are five pillars to save Britain.
3034.30 3035.30 SPEAKER_07  Oh.
3035.30 3036.30 SPEAKER_07  Are.
3036.30 3037.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
3037.30 3038.30 SPEAKER_07  I'll just do it.
3038.30 3039.30 SPEAKER_07  Difficult not to is the thing.
3039.30 3040.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
3040.30 3041.30 SPEAKER_07  B-boying.
3041.30 3042.30 SPEAKER_07  All right, go on.
3042.30 3043.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
3043.30 3044.30 SPEAKER_07  So make work pay.
3044.30 3045.30 SPEAKER_07  So lifting the income tax.
3045.30 3049.30 SPEAKER_07  So cutting taxes, basically cut 5% of government spending, remove.
3049.30 3050.30 SPEAKER_08  But not raising wages.
3050.30 3051.30 SPEAKER_08  Never raise wages.
3051.30 3052.30 SPEAKER_08  No, of course.
3052.30 3053.30 SPEAKER_08  That must never happen.
3053.30 3056.30 SPEAKER_07  Uh, remove daft EU regulations.
3056.30 3059.30 SPEAKER_08  I think the word daft feels inappropriate here.
3059.30 3062.30 SPEAKER_08  Uh, that have a one in one out immigration system.
3062.30 3063.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah.
3063.30 3064.30 SPEAKER_08  Like fucking human rights.
3064.30 3065.30 SPEAKER_08  One in one out.
3065.30 3066.30 SPEAKER_08  Or like a fucking nightclub.
3066.30 3068.30 SPEAKER_08  Like they're queuing up at Dover.
3068.30 3069.30 SPEAKER_08  There's like a velvet rope.
3069.30 3072.30 SPEAKER_08  And there's a guy going, not in those fucking shoes, mate.
3072.30 3073.30 SPEAKER_05  So it's not.
3073.30 3074.30 SPEAKER_08  So it's not.
3074.30 3076.30 SPEAKER_08  Once again, extremely prescient, though.
3076.30 3078.30 SPEAKER_07  So it's, it's not Sven.
3078.30 3079.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, that's right.
3079.30 3080.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
3080.30 3081.30 SPEAKER_08  Hang on.
3081.30 3083.30 SPEAKER_08  Like British geezer Sven is a very funny idea.
3083.30 3085.30 SPEAKER_08  Do you know, do you know who's playing in there?
3085.30 3086.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah.
3086.30 3087.30 SPEAKER_08  Rishi Suno.
3087.30 3088.30 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
3088.30 3089.30 SPEAKER_06  But who else?
3089.30 3090.30 SPEAKER_06  I do.
3090.30 3092.30 SPEAKER_06  I do like the idea of like running your immigration system.
3092.30 3096.30 SPEAKER_06  Like you're doing like a night, like you're a nightclub bouncer in like Fanet.
3096.30 3097.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah.
3097.30 3099.30 SPEAKER_08  But who's doing a set of DCMS at three in the morning?
3099.30 3100.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah.
3100.30 3101.30 SPEAKER_08  So you don't fucking know, do you?
3101.30 3103.30 SPEAKER_08  It's a queer space in there.
3103.30 3105.30 SPEAKER_08  No fucking tourists.
3105.30 3106.30 SPEAKER_08  No fucking coke heads.
3106.30 3107.30 SPEAKER_08  All right.
3107.30 3112.30 SPEAKER_07  And to scrap the job destroying multi trillion pound burden of net zero.
3112.30 3115.30 SPEAKER_04  So this is what is a job creating thing.
3115.30 3117.30 SPEAKER_04  It's going to create so many jobs.
3117.30 3120.30 SPEAKER_02  Oil creates the jobs, Milo.
3120.30 3125.30 SPEAKER_02  Oil lubricates the ass of the economy, Eli.
3125.30 3126.30 SPEAKER_05  I drink your cum.
3126.30 3127.30 SPEAKER_05  I've abandoned my child.
3127.30 3130.30 SPEAKER_05  Daniel Day-Lewis in Salt Burn.
3130.30 3131.30 SPEAKER_03  What about labor?
3131.30 3136.30 SPEAKER_03  So, this is Keir Starmer made his Project Hope speech in Bristol.
3136.30 3138.30 None  There's very little hope in this Project Hope.
3138.30 3139.30 None  Yeah.
3139.30 3141.30 SPEAKER_03  What's the opportunity for the project?
3141.30 3144.30 SPEAKER_07  I think that's the opportunity for the project.
3144.30 3145.30 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3145.30 3146.30 SPEAKER_07  A lot of people who have been in the world.
3146.30 3147.30 SPEAKER_07  It's not just like a lot of people.
3147.30 3148.30 SPEAKER_07  It's not just like a lot of people.
3148.30 3149.30 SPEAKER_07  You don't know.
3149.30 3150.30 SPEAKER_07  You're like a lot of people.
3150.30 3151.30 SPEAKER_07  You're like a lot of people.
3151.30 3152.30 SPEAKER_07  You're like a lot of people.
3152.30 3153.30 SPEAKER_07  You're like a lot of people.
3153.30 3154.30 SPEAKER_07  Project Hope.
3154.30 3155.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
3155.30 3156.30 SPEAKER_07  What's the opposite of an erection?
3156.30 3157.30 SPEAKER_07  Because I've got one.
3157.30 3175.30 SPEAKER_07  What will happen when Project Hope comes up against the fact that you have supported an ongoing, possibly legally defined based on how the proceedings at the ICJ go, genocide as being proven by the courts because Israeli teenagers can't stop uploading snuff films.
3175.30 3176.30 SPEAKER_07  Right.
3176.30 3181.30 SPEAKER_07  What happens when Project Hope comes up against we were on the side of the genocide heirs?
3181.30 3182.30 SPEAKER_08  I don't know.
3182.30 3183.30 SPEAKER_08  You're going to.
3183.30 3190.30 SPEAKER_08  There's going to be a fucking deus ex machina with that court case because there's no way based on the evidence that's being presented, they can conclude that it's not a genocide.
3190.30 3198.30 SPEAKER_08  But on the other hand, like fucking Hillary Clinton will kick the door in and set off a smoke grenade or something like there's no way it's going to be allowed to go through.
3198.30 3203.30 SPEAKER_08  Like there will be a fucking drone strike on the courtroom before they're allowed to
3203.30 3205.30 SPEAKER_07  say that it's a genocide. We spoke about this in the episode with Seamus.
3205.30 3214.30 SPEAKER_07  It's that the ICJ, the thing about the ICJ is that it's like so many international institutions, its decisions are unenforceable, but it would be a gigantic propaganda loss.
3214.30 3215.30 SPEAKER_08  Well, that's what I mean.
3215.30 3221.30 SPEAKER_08  Even just, even just saying it on paper, it doesn't mean anything, but like in kind of optics terms would be massive.
3221.30 3226.30 SPEAKER_07  This is, this is who project hope is very much hitched its wagon to.
3226.30 3227.30 SPEAKER_07  Right.
3227.30 3236.30 SPEAKER_07  So, so he says to defeat this miserable story project, we must crush their politics of divide and decline with a new project hope, not grandiose utopian hope.
3236.30 3238.30 SPEAKER_07  Oh, just the shit kind then.
3238.30 3239.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
3239.30 3240.30 SPEAKER_07  So not the kind.
3240.30 3241.30 SPEAKER_07  Remember how we talk.
3241.30 3244.30 SPEAKER_07  I always go back to the free broadband thing, broadband communism.
3244.30 3245.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
3245.30 3252.30 SPEAKER_05  One really basic thing that would have made life in Britain, like 1% less shit in concrete
3252.30 3256.30 SPEAKER_00  terms. He wanted to fill the internet cables with jam.
3256.30 3259.30 SPEAKER_00  He wanted to turn the whole internet into jam.
3259.30 3265.30 SPEAKER_00  And all you'd be able to get would be the communist manifesto and gardeners question time.
3265.30 3267.30 SPEAKER_00  A hellish dystopia.
3267.30 3270.30 SPEAKER_08  I don't know why it's Julie Birchill, but slow Birchill.
3270.30 3275.30 SPEAKER_08  This is like, this is like after dark, like, uh, mellow magic Birchill.
3275.30 3276.30 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3276.30 3277.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah.
3277.30 3278.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
3278.30 3279.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
3279.30 3280.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
3280.30 3281.30 SPEAKER_07  You got to tell the bouncer that you'll get in.
3281.30 3285.30 SPEAKER_07  Not the hope of the easy answer, the quick fix of the miracle cure, but they get broadband communism, quote unquote.
3285.30 3287.30 SPEAKER_07  That was a thing that would have fixed a problem.
3287.30 3288.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
3288.30 3289.30 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3289.30 3291.30 SPEAKER_07  Problem, which we are now constantly complaining about too.
3291.30 3292.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
3292.30 3293.30 SPEAKER_07  Right.
3293.30 3298.30 SPEAKER_07  And so this is the kind of grandiose utopian hope, which is a big identifiable thing that they won't be doing.
3298.30 3304.30 SPEAKER_07  So, because that's an easy answer, a quick fix or a miracle cure, as opposed to using the magic of AI, which is sensible.
3304.30 3305.30 SPEAKER_07  Of course.
3305.30 3311.30 SPEAKER_08  It's very funny to talk about like, like using this disparaging frame of like easy answers and quick fixes.
3311.30 3319.30 SPEAKER_08  But where, where like colloquially, what that refers to is things which purport to be easy answers or quick fixes, but which aren't easy answers and wouldn't fix anything.
3319.30 3324.30 SPEAKER_08  Whereas what he's describing is things which actually would be easy answers and quick fixes to problems.
3324.30 3329.30 SPEAKER_08  Like, because basically the British government is so fucking mired in shit.
3329.30 3343.30 SPEAKER_08  They're so bad at their job that if just anyone with like half a brain who wasn't insane went in there, they could do like 50 things in a day that would make this country so much better and wouldn't even cost that much money because that's how badly run Britain is.
3343.30 3346.30 SPEAKER_08  Like that's not even addressing the difficult intractable problems.
3346.30 3347.30 SPEAKER_07  He says, no, Milo.
3347.30 3348.30 SPEAKER_07  Okay.
3348.30 3357.30 SPEAKER_07  They need credible hope, a frank hope, a hope that levels with you about the hard road ahead, but which shows you a way through the light at the end of a tunnel.
3357.30 3358.30 SPEAKER_07  A hard hope.
3358.30 3364.30 SPEAKER_08  A firm, turdid hope, which despite its stealing exterior has...
3364.30 3365.30 SPEAKER_08  Fuck me.
3365.30 3368.30 SPEAKER_07  I can't even continue the rave.
3368.30 3370.30 SPEAKER_07  The hope of a certain destination.
3370.30 3371.30 SPEAKER_07  Okay.
3371.30 3383.30 SPEAKER_08  The hope of, we may not get to our destination on the train, but eventually, via the Optimism replacement bus, we will find our way to a new firm hope.
3383.30 3388.30 SPEAKER_08  It will not be Starmageddon, but Starmerfuture.
3388.30 3399.30 SPEAKER_08  We will find our way to the sunlit uplands of a tax credit you can use to redeem to get your child BTEC tuition in a coding program of your choice.
3399.30 3405.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, it's like less sunlit uplands, more like sort of moderately overcast hill, you know?
3405.30 3406.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
3406.30 3409.30 SPEAKER_07  So, that's why the national missions we've set are measurable goals.
3409.30 3411.30 SPEAKER_07  And then we've talked about the missions before.
3411.30 3414.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, they never make anything better because it will cost too much money.
3414.30 3419.30 SPEAKER_07  I know they will take hard work, determination, patience, and a true national effort.
3419.30 3424.30 SPEAKER_07  And for some people, that invites a sharp intake of breath, a raised eyebrow, or a question, can it really be done?
3424.30 3426.30 SPEAKER_05  Sorry, did Keir Starmer just fucking tell me to eat bitterness?
3426.30 3437.30 SPEAKER_05  Like, what the fuck kind of like, shared appeal to like, uh, like national values is he doing here when he hasn't fucking done anything except tell me how shit everything's got to be?
3437.30 3438.30 SPEAKER_05  Like, mmm.
3438.30 3445.30 SPEAKER_07  And that's going up against the famous guy who's gonna say we're gonna do a nightclub system for Britain's, uh, immigration.
3445.30 3446.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
3446.30 3447.30 SPEAKER_05  This is gonna be, this is supposed to be Project Hope.
3447.30 3448.30 SPEAKER_05  What hope?
3448.30 3449.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, awesome.
3449.30 3453.30 SPEAKER_08  I love that we've gone from things can only get better to just nah, just no.
3453.30 3456.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, things can maybe stay more or less the same.
3456.30 3457.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, if you're lucky.
3457.30 3458.30 SPEAKER_07  Mmm.
3458.30 3461.30 SPEAKER_07  But what keeps me up at night is a different reaction altogether.
3461.30 3463.30 SPEAKER_08  It's something called disco biscuits.
3463.30 3470.30 SPEAKER_07  The biggest challenge we face, bar none, the shrug of the shoulder, because this is the paradox of British politics right now.
3470.30 3475.30 SPEAKER_07  Everyone agrees we're in a huge mess with services on their knees, an economy that doesn't work for working people.
3475.30 3476.30 SPEAKER_07  Uh.
3476.30 3480.30 SPEAKER_07  Um, and everyone agrees as well that it's been like this for a while, that Britain needs to change.
3480.30 3481.30 SPEAKER_07  Yes.
3481.30 3482.30 SPEAKER_07  It wants change and is crying out for change.
3482.30 3487.30 SPEAKER_07  And yet, the trust in politics is so low that nobody believes you can make a difference
3487.30 3491.30 SPEAKER_05  anymore. The solutions are shit, including yours!
3491.30 3492.30 SPEAKER_06  No one wants them!
3492.30 3497.30 SPEAKER_06  Also the point being that in 2019, that was very much like the referendum.
3497.30 3506.30 SPEAKER_06  It was like, okay, do you want like some very basic things to be changed in a way that might be better for you, but the trade off is that it might also be better for other people as well.
3506.30 3508.30 SPEAKER_06  And the British public were like, fucking no.
3508.30 3509.30 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, do you want to be happy?
3509.30 3510.30 SPEAKER_08  Absolutely not.
3510.30 3511.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
3511.30 3512.30 SPEAKER_08  Right.
3512.30 3515.30 SPEAKER_08  Do you want jam to be poured into the telecoms network and people said no?
3515.30 3525.30 SPEAKER_06  So, so like what the argument, you know, is, uh, yeah, you want to be happier, but you don't want to be happier if the trade off of that is other people are happier as well.
3525.30 3531.30 SPEAKER_06  And so actually being miserable is fine because other people will also suffer as well.
3531.30 3532.30 SPEAKER_07  Here's what he said.
3532.30 3541.30 SPEAKER_07  He said, the nation is so tired, exhausted, and despairing that they've given up on hope, a national mood, which if we aren't successful with our project hope, the Tories will seek to exploit.
3541.30 3543.30 SPEAKER_08  Of course, we've given up on hope.
3543.30 3548.30 SPEAKER_08  Keir Starmer is the leader of the Labour Party for fuck's sake.
3548.30 3553.30 SPEAKER_08  Like this, the one man you can vote for who can win the election.
3553.30 3558.30 SPEAKER_08  Who's not Rishi Sunak is Keir fucking summer.
3558.30 3561.30 SPEAKER_08  A man who exists on a platform of like, well, I don't know.
3561.30 3570.30 SPEAKER_08  I think, um, if we just, if we muddle around a bit, if we get a computer involved, I think possibly, you know, maybe one child could have a school dinner.
3570.30 3576.30 SPEAKER_08  Like it's just, forgive me for not being inspired by the least inspiring man on the planet.
3576.30 3580.30 SPEAKER_08  He has the charisma of glue that's been poured into a suit.
3580.30 3583.30 SPEAKER_08  Like why, why would I have any hope?
3583.30 3584.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
3584.30 3585.30 SPEAKER_07  And, and so that's, and that's the thing, right?
3585.30 3590.30 SPEAKER_07  He's saying that, right, that the Tories and, and reform as well, right?
3590.30 3595.30 SPEAKER_07  Who are going to be piloting the Tories and therefore piloting Labour indirectly, right?
3595.30 3602.30 SPEAKER_07  They are going to give people something actual, which is we will identify and hurt the people you don't like.
3602.30 3603.30 SPEAKER_07  Oh, cool.
3603.30 3604.30 SPEAKER_07  Right.
3604.30 3605.30 SPEAKER_07  I hope one of those isn't me.
3605.30 3608.30 SPEAKER_07  And then Labour is, they're basically saying, oh, don't listen to that.
3608.30 3612.30 SPEAKER_07  However, we will be giving you costed hope.
3612.30 3617.30 SPEAKER_07  So either you get the full fat of the thing you like, or- We will moderately hurt the people you don't like.
3617.30 3618.30 SPEAKER_07  Precisely.
3618.30 3621.30 SPEAKER_08  To the correct extent, in a reasonable way.
3621.30 3625.30 SPEAKER_08  I might kneecap someone you don't like, but I won't kill them because that would be wrong.
3625.30 3626.30 SPEAKER_08  Mm-hmm.
3626.30 3635.30 SPEAKER_07  So he says, uh, of course he takes a pop at, uh, at the previous, uh, Labour leadership for having vision, of not having vision-driven politics.
3635.30 3636.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
3636.30 3640.30 SPEAKER_07  Jeremy Corbyn, a man who couldn't kneecap someone even if it were in the national interest.
3640.30 3644.30 SPEAKER_07  Despite his friends in the IRA, who I'm sure could have taught him a thing or two.
3644.30 3648.30 SPEAKER_07  He says, despite hoarding all that power, central government lacks ambition.
3648.30 3655.30 SPEAKER_07  A view of the potential government that is just content to mop up problems after the fact armed only with a big state checkbook.
3655.30 3656.30 SPEAKER_07  We've got to change this.
3656.30 3659.30 SPEAKER_07  It's vital for taking on the profound challenges of our era.
3659.30 3660.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
3660.30 3666.30 SPEAKER_07  The rising geopolitical tensions, climate change, terrorism, securing our borders, the revolution- All things that's written by the checkbook.
3666.30 3667.30 SPEAKER_07  ...in science and technology.
3667.30 3669.30 SPEAKER_07  So I promise this, a new mindset.
3669.30 3674.30 SPEAKER_07  So that's what's coming up against, like, we're gonna put a bouncer in Dover, is a new mindset.
3674.30 3675.30 SPEAKER_07  The star mindset.
3675.30 3676.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
3676.30 3677.30 SPEAKER_07  Mission government, which we've talked about before.
3677.30 3678.30 SPEAKER_05  This is the real shit coach.
3678.30 3681.30 SPEAKER_07  6am and I watch paint dry for one hour.
3681.30 3690.30 SPEAKER_05  Slamming the VHS of Blair's election into the TV every morning and doing the moves alongside him.
3690.30 3691.30 SPEAKER_05  What, like jazzercise?
3691.30 3692.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
3692.30 3693.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
3693.30 3696.86 SPEAKER_07  So don't listen to the siren voices saying we can't change Britain, so don't listen to
3696.86 3702.30 SPEAKER_08  Milo. I'm gonna run for election on the ritual suicide party, like we all just fucking kill ourselves.
3702.30 3711.30 SPEAKER_05  The siren voices also implies that like Farage is quite sexy, which I don't see it, to be honest.
3711.30 3718.30 SPEAKER_08  I mean, well, for that one woman who tweeted Nigel Farage sexy pics and then immediately followed by how to delete tweets.
3718.30 3719.30 SPEAKER_07  We can and we will.
3719.30 3721.30 SPEAKER_07  Don't listen when they say we're all the same.
3721.30 3723.30 SPEAKER_07  We're not and we will never be.
3723.30 3725.30 SPEAKER_07  And don't listen when they say politics makes no difference because it does.
3725.30 3727.30 SPEAKER_07  We fucking act like it then.
3727.30 3728.30 SPEAKER_05  For once.
3728.30 3729.30 SPEAKER_05  Ever.
3729.30 3730.30 SPEAKER_07  Please.
3730.30 3734.30 SPEAKER_07  Now, what I liked about this speech though is you know what questions Starmer got?
3734.30 3740.30 SPEAKER_05  No, because I can't even hear you because the relaxation vein is deafening me.
3740.30 3745.30 SPEAKER_08  Mr. Starmer, how did you get so charismatic and engaging?
3745.30 3748.30 SPEAKER_07  Thank you kid, but there's no need to call me Mr. Starmer.
3748.30 3751.30 SPEAKER_07  Mr. Starmer was my father who was a toolmaker by the way.
3751.30 3752.30 SPEAKER_07  He made tools.
3752.30 3755.30 SPEAKER_07  I don't make any tools, but I do respect those who do.
3755.30 3766.30 SPEAKER_07  So, Jim Pickard of the FT asks Starmer whether Peter Mandelson described in described as a core part of Starmer's network had questions to answer.
3766.30 3768.30 SPEAKER_07  A core part of someone else's network too.
3768.30 3769.30 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
3769.30 3776.30 SPEAKER_07  Had questions to answer regarding the fact that he frequently stayed at Epstein's Manhattan townhouse in like the 2010s.
3776.30 3781.30 SPEAKER_08  And I slipped right down the staircase and into his townhouse.
3781.30 3785.30 SPEAKER_07  So, while Epstein was in jail.
3785.30 3786.30 SPEAKER_07  Did Maddelson stay at the townhouse?
3786.30 3788.30 SPEAKER_05  His house is going to be free.
3788.30 3790.30 SPEAKER_05  He needs someone to water his plants.
3790.30 3791.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, it was house sitting.
3791.30 3793.30 SPEAKER_08  Stay in a hotel!
3793.30 3798.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah, well that's how you know there was nothing untoward going on.
3798.30 3800.30 SPEAKER_08  Because it was Jeffrey Epstein who was the pedophile.
3800.30 3801.30 SPEAKER_08  Yeah, he was in jail!
3801.30 3807.30 SPEAKER_08  What was that, just unsupervised pedophilia happening at Jeffrey Epstein's house while he was in jail?
3807.30 3808.30 SPEAKER_07  Come on.
3808.30 3818.30 SPEAKER_07  Starmer said, on Peter Mandelson, look, and I do try to give pretty full answers in these sessions, but I don't know any more than you do, and therefore there's really not much I can add to what you already know.
3818.30 3820.30 SPEAKER_07  He's a core part of your network, you could ask him.
3820.30 3823.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, did you talk to him about it, maybe?
3823.30 3824.30 SPEAKER_07  Ever?
3824.30 3825.30 SPEAKER_07  Well no, that would be impolite.
3825.30 3829.30 SPEAKER_08  Well don't ask him while you're standing at the top of his staircase though, that would be my recommendation.
3829.30 3832.30 SPEAKER_08  Or at least check it for Lurpak first.
3832.30 3833.30 SPEAKER_07  Anyway, anyway.
3833.30 3835.30 SPEAKER_08  I think that's about all the time we have for today.
3835.30 3844.30 SPEAKER_05  Just perfect, perfect press conference to be like, Project Hope, the hope is my mindset will be different.
3844.30 3849.30 SPEAKER_05  I have no thoughts whatsoever about the implication of my colleague.
3849.30 3850.30 SPEAKER_05  Thanks for coming.
3850.30 3851.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, perfect.
3851.30 3852.30 SPEAKER_07  I have nothing.
3852.30 3854.30 SPEAKER_07  Project Hope, hey, maybe you can hope for an answer.
3854.30 3855.30 SPEAKER_07  Bye everybody.

3865.30 3866.30 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, my pleasure.
