oh there we go
it has a smell
oh it's very pungent
it's got quite a bouquet
okay so listeners Brian has
purchased for us
something that is called
Haunted Apple Fanta
it is in collaboration with the new
Beetlejuice movie
you're making it sound like an ad
I just got this at the grocery store
this episode of the worst of all possible worlds
is brought to you by Beetlejuice
I thought an actual ad
Jones does like a green apple
so this is crucially
Haunted Apple
spiced apple soda
now there's no caffeine
in this I should note that
contains no juice
it says in very big letters
it has Michael Keaton making his O face
right there on the can
as Beetlejuice
it's striped
it is horrible to look at
as Matty was saying earlier
it is awful to behold
so uh why don't we all just kind of take a sip
it is neon green
here we go
oh no oh no
here we go
oh
oh
oh
oh no
hey fellas
yeah I don't hate this
this is pretty
no
really
this is like a
it's like an apple cider
but it's a soda pop
I don't know
oh the cinnamon really lingers
yeah
I was about to say
the cinnamon really lingers
I don't know
that was on the same page
the cinnamon really lingers
derogatory
Matty
the cinnamon really lingers
positive
this is great
that was not what I was expecting
I'm about to go scan for more info
so many possible worlds
but we got this one
so many possible worlds
but we got this one
welcome to the worst of all possible worlds
the first and only podcast
that you should scan for more info
I'm the worst of all possible AJ's
I'm the worst of all possible Brian's
and I'm the worst of all possible Josh's
and you've already heard
AJ why are you laughing
no I'm sorry
it is really green
it is like phosphorus and green
green like beetle juice
I feel like it should be like cider colored
but I guess I understand why it's green
it should be black and white striped
what's important to know
is that every time a soda is a color
they turned it that color
yeah
this was not God's doing
we should introduce our guest today
because you are of course hearing
we have a fourth voice on the mic today
they are a cartoonist
who writes a weekly webcomic
and in 2023
published their first graphic novel
called Boys Weekend
they also co-host
the Temporal Culture War podcast
with Clayton Ashley
that recaps episodes of Star Trek Enterprise
as well as the forthcoming
very very soon
maybe we'll even be out
by the time this episode is released
who can say
who knows
No Gods No Mayors podcast
with friends of our show
November Kelly and Riley Quinn
please welcome to the show
Matty Lubchansky
hi
thank you for having me on
just crucially also
Temporal Culture War
not a recap podcast
where we do recap the episodes
but it's mostly about
what was going on in 2001 in America
the week of this
the airing of Star Trek Enterprise
right
right
so we're trying to get to the heart of
you know
them trying to capture
John Q Truck
of Central A Kansas
as he listens
as he watches Enterprise every week
kind of placing it
in the cultural context
of the moment
yes
that is also our goal
with every episode of this podcast
how can we reach
that's why we replaced our theme song
with the Enterprise theme song
I got a face
of a heart
Brendan Dalton is going to be so good
oh but we are here today
to talk about a film
I had not seen until
two days ago
yes
which that's astonishing to me
AJ
that you had not seen this movie
I know
that's crazy
for the record
I didn't see it until like
last year myself
yeah
were you guys raised
like under a rock
or a carpet
no I was
I was not
I was just did not watch
a lot of movies
I think is sort of
the big thing
AJ has never seen a movie
I notoriously have never seen
a movie
Josh but he saw Roger Rabbit
when I was a kid
I saw Roger Rabbit
I think
I think because
it was
it was just
it's such a horny film
I think maybe that's why
because I hung out
with a lot of
my mother certainly had an issue
with Jessica Rabbit
yeah
she made that known
I think it's just a thing
I was I was hanging out
around with a lot of like
evangelical Christians
at the time
when I was growing up
and so
it wasn't like
I would go to a
this is like such a
sleepover movie
I feel
it's something you'd go
and like to a friend's house
and watch with your friends
but that this just wasn't
the kind of movie
we were watching
sure
mostly because
when I would go over
sleepovers
I'd go to a guy's house
who had a box
under his TV
that would bleep out
any curse words
that was called
the TVG
short for TV Guardian
there's a technology
connections
episode on YouTube
about it
it's also something
I know about
because
I had that
oh yeah
oh my god
Brian I remember
telling the story
about Woody
in Toy Story
yes
whenever you got
to a swear word
in the dialogue
it read the closed captioning
and it would mute
the volume
for that full line
of closed captioning
and then display
the captions
but censored
in some ways
I can only play
Toy Story with
TV Genie
yeah
TV Guardian
sorry
it wouldn't be
a genie
that's religiously
confusing
for the evangelicals
who buy it
that's corrupt
yeah
that's of the occult
but everyone comes
with three witches
yeah
three witches
no not that either
no definitely
so it would censor
of course like
damn and hell
would just sort of
go blank
but then it had
like funnier
spicier words
of course it always
censored God and Jesus
so if you watched
a Christian movie
like that would go away
it would censor
wuss
in addition to pussy
huh
okay
and change it to
wimp
so then you could
see someone
talking about
her wimp
and it would also
censor
balls
right
ass
sometimes ass
in the middle
of a word
butt
was also censored
gay
would be censored
would butt be censored
if someone was saying
like I love you
but I am leaving
no they didn't get
the conjunction
in there
they censored gay
and then the weirdest
one was they censored
the word woody
a word I have never
heard in its sexual
connotation
even right now
on this very
ribald podcast
and remind me again
Brian what they
called woody
notion
which that doesn't
even make sense
hey that rod up there
has given me a notion
to be fair
watching this movie
I got several notions
because this movie
is shockingly horny
for a kids movie
but like
Zemeckis
because we used to be
a real country
that's right
we did
but like Zemeckis
himself is also
like a pretty horny
filmmaker
he wrote a whole
trilogy of movies
about wanting to
fuck his own mom
right
and that was
also a family film
well before we get
into talking
about you know
how this movie
came to be
and so forth
I wanted
Matty to just
sort of ask you
a little bit
about your
experience with this
because as we've
said you are
a cartoonist
you have an
enjoyment of
things like that
I don't know
why I said that
that way
I do
you know I do
be having an
enjoyment of
things like this
that's exactly
correct Josh
things like cartoons
it's funny because
I didn't watch it
for a really long
time
I definitely saw
it either in
theaters or at
a sleepover
or something
I saw it a lot
when I was a little
kid maybe I think
I might have had
it taped off
of television
there's I don't
know if you
recall a very
short-lived
technology called
VCR Plus
where it was
basically there
was every show
when the TV
guide had a code
next to it
and if you
punch that code
into the VCR
it would like
automatically tape
that show for you
it was like
rudimentary
Tebow from
First Principles
it was just like
an algorithm
for a time
code in a channel
so I figured
out how to do
this myself
and I would
just tape
whatever I
wanted to watch
and just no one
was paying enough
attention to me
the late night
broadcast of real
sex on HBO
yes
or I'd go back
downstairs at night
and watch that
vacuum suits
okay
I have a really
vivid memory
of the vacuum
suit
that's the one
everyone has seen
for some reason
I remember the one
where they show
a very big lady
stomping on men
okay
informative experiences
it's just all
activation moments
there was a
legitimate activation
moment seeing a
trans woman on
one of those shows
thank you HBO
for all you've done
for me
so with Roger
Rabbit then
like how old
like you said
you were a kid
like roughly how
old would you say
you were when you
saw this movie
for the first time
that's a really
great question
what year did this
come out this
came out in the
80s right
yeah
it was 88
88 yeah I think
I didn't probably
didn't see this
movie until I was
like 10 or 11
a couple years ago
it might have been
because I was I
was in a blank
check and they
were doing Zemeckis
I haven't seen
Roger Rabbit in
forever I want to
rewatch Roger Rabbit
and I was like this
is maybe two years
ago and I was like
this is a fucking
miracle like I
don't yeah I
don't understand
how this works
yeah it should be
on so many levels
like technically
it's so impressive
yeah there's that
one very famous
letter that goes
around sometimes
where they're like
make eye contact
with the you have
to be making eye
contact at all times
like it works so
much better than
most blue screen
things of even the
time or even
later it's like some
of the best tennis
ball acting ever
committed to film
right and certain
actors are much
better at tennis
ball acting than
other actors and I
don't think anyone's
done it better than
Bob Hoskins in this
movie no I and I
and I remember like
loving it because I
was also a real
really really obsessed
with the Super Mario
Brothers movie as a
child oh yeah
hell yeah so I was
like that's my guy
that is my man
that is my Mario
Mario that's my
Mario Mario that's
the thing we've had
comic artists on to
talk about Bob
Hoskins movies before
we have we had
Michael Kupperman on
to talk about heart
condition one of the
worst things he ever
made so join us next
month when Jim Davis
joins us to talk
about pennies from
heaven that's wrong
Who Framed Roger
Rabbit comes out in
1988 and is a huge
like box office
success yeah it was a
gigantic risk and it
paid off they put so
much money into this
film but they had
like reason to do so
because Robert
Zemeckis was having
the best 80s anyone
probably had while
Zemeckis had a really
great 80s it didn't
start out great in
1980 he comes out
swinging with this huge
flop used cars yeah
and I am also still
drinking this Fanta
throughout the course
of December
making eye contact
with everyone
with all the hoes
saying this is really
good yeah no I'm
still drinking it so
I don't know what
that says about me
it's kind of garbage
it's kind of making
me a little phlegmy
I don't know what
they have in here
but I saw our
extra amount of
sugar they have in
this am I detecting
a note of clove in
here too yeah a
little bit it's got
that cider thing
a haunting of clove
a haunting of clove
it's less sugar than
I thought it's only
42 grams I feel like
compared to a regular
fan to drink that's
that's a little low
yeah so used cars is
Zemeckis's second film
yeah generally well
received but not a
great not a great
commercial hit right
it is it is for a
for all intents and
purposes a flop and
he spends a couple of
years in studio jail no
one is willing to give
him a project yeah
because of the bomb of
used cars until he made
two of the most seminal
films of the 80s back to
back he made romancing
the stone and of
course back to the
future romancing the
stone something that
hasn't really carried
through to the modern
day and like pop
culture that's super
well remembered but
it's it's it I think it
holds up for the most
part it's in it's
another you know after
indiana jones people
like how do we do
another indiana jones
yeah and this is the
only one that ever
really stuck I watched
the very bad movie they
were attempting to read
it was not a remake but
the what was it the
sandra bullock lost
city movie from a
couple years ago
they're clearly
really hard it's called
the lost city I think
I feel like I absorbed
romance in the stone
by osmosis which is to
say in like 15 minutes
snippets on comedy
central yeah in the
afternoon when I was in
high school oh sure
yeah but I never I've
never sat down and
watched the film I it's
not something I would
seek out whereas back
to the future it became
like a cornerstone of
American pop culture
yeah so much so that
there is a there's
currently a musical of
it playing on
Broadway yeah I saw
like it will live
there forever the car
is so fucking cool is
it it's unbelievable
do it I don't know but
at the end of the show
they make the car go
upside down yeah they
do a little flippy
flips oh yeah oh
do they wait then
where's it going because
it's gonna need roads
when it gets there
right they it lifts up
in the air Brian where
they're going they
don't need roads we're
actually on a stage yeah
they're going nine
years into the past
yeah you know Robert
Zemeckis to quote a
podcast that was brought
up a couple of minutes
ago has a blank check at
this point in Hollywood
he has the ability to get
into any room he wants
and in addition he has
Steven Spielberg there to
back him up yeah and so
they decide to do this
project that has been
kind of in development
since 1981 when Disney
bought the rights to a
book by Gary K.
Wolf who is not as his
name implies a cartoon
wolf and he is a
he is a cartoon Gary
that's true he is a
cartoon Gary he's a
cartoon Gary and a
live-action wolf but just
his eyes and his teeth
it's very disconcerting to
look at and this book is
called who censored
Roger Rabbit yeah and
has anyone read the book
that no but I know he's
like a newspaper character
in it yeah he's a comic
strip character different
and he talks in speech
bubbles his speech
bubbles get taken away
there's a lot of stuff
there's like a genie it's
a little much and we
don't really know how it
got to Disney but like
while it was still at the
publisher before it got
published somebody sent a
manuscript over to
Disney okay bunny
somebody wants and is
this a novel or a
graphic novel it's a
novel novel a real
novel I just remember
the cover of the cover
of it is like American
novel who censored
Roger Rabbit I do
remember the cover of
it is like there's like
a gumshoe facing a
silhouette of like
basically one of the
rabbits from David
Lynch's rabbits it's
like the mascot yeah
it's like he's Harvey
sized Zemeckis and
Spielberg had been
working together for a
long long time because
Zemeckis basically the
way Spielberg tells it
just like stormed into
his office and was like
I have a student film
you're going to watch
it and Spielberg was
like yeah okay I'm not
doing anything
stylistically very similar
people they're both
really into special
effects they both know
how to get a how to
get the job done and
Spielberg produces the
first two directorial
ventures of young
Zemeckis I want to
hold your hand and the
aforementioned used
did you guys watch the
young Zemeckis
adventures I thought
they were pretty good
it was interesting a lot
of money a lot higher
budget than you'd expect
for a TV thing yeah you
find out why he wants
to have sex with his
mom so bad so Disney as
we said acquires the
rights in 1981 and they
bring on Jeffrey Price
and Peter S. Seaman to
do the script for it
that's how hard it is
cartoon Seaman yeah so
I just want I want to
shout out Price and
Seaman here for a
minute because them as
a writing duo what a
what a weird and wild
career these two have
had writing things they
wrote the Jim Carrey
how the Grinch stole
Christmas screenplay
they wrote Shrek the
third okay third and of
course they wrote the
screenplay for wild
wild west and were
forced to include the
giant mechanical spider
they were the guys who
finally got fucking
owned by John Peters
they also wrote the
script to Doc Hollywood
which is a film that I
don't I love that movie
yeah I see it they
plays it's like a
perfect TNT film yeah
and it has great David
Ogden Steyer's role in
that one it has it has
the theme song of I am the
one and only by Chesney
Hawk which is such an
outrageously 80s song
despite being released in
91 and it is also I use
it as a drop on fancy
movie time all the time
because it is preposterous
there's a guy in the
background who just goes
oh yeah every single
chorus it rules so
Zemeckis is brought on to
direct the live action
sequences of who framed
Roger Rabbit and
Richard Williams is
brought on to do the
animated sequences yeah
and Williams is like a
fascinatingly like prickly
guy yeah right he's
really interesting because
he's not a Disney guy he's
not an MGM guy he's not a
WB guy he as a teenager
was like no fuck cartoons
he saw Snow White when it
came out and was like this
is the greatest thing
that's ever happened I'm
gonna make cartoons and
then he saw a Rembrandt
painting once and he said
I'm never gonna make a
cartoon fuck this shit
and then he's like and
then I painted for seven
years and then when I was
19 and so then he he moves
to England and becomes a
commercial animator and
it's kind of his own
company and then he uses
the money from that to
self-fund his own
independent projects if
I'm correct me if I'm
wrong but I think he did a
bunch of like really
classic like title
sequences like yes yes
yes yes he did the
Pink Panther
Pink Panther
so um funny thing
happened the way to the
forum I think yes
which has the best
credits it's got an
incredible credit awful
movie
yeah R.I.P.
Zero Mostel
you tried your best
buddy
given that of course
you create a lot of
comics and stuff like
that can you trace back
to any like big
influential pieces or
works or anything like
that that impressed on
you in that way yeah I
mean I think I was
really I was actually
really really obsessed
with newspaper cartoons
as a child yeah
um stupidly and
annoyingly I was
obsessed with Dilbert
when I was like nine
mm-hmm I don't know
why I can see the
far side character
tattooed on your arm
literally the beehive
lady from Far Side
tattooed on me I was
about to get to her
yeah um who I just I
just I just thought the
far side was the
funniest thing in the
world even when I
didn't I would I
have all these vivid
memories of not
understanding them and
like yes being like I'm
going to get this one
day
I'm gonna laugh so
fucking hard
and then sometimes it
turns out that they're
just not funny
no
that's incorrect
they're funny but there
was nothing to get it's
just like no that he
just thinks this is
really silly
right right
cow tools
yeah that's just
turning over cow tools
being like I will solve
you
sorry you're right just a
point of clarification
here for the far side
yes it's always funny
yeah
other comics on the
other hand
oh sure
sure yeah yeah
because that's definitely
the experience of being
a kid reading the comic
page is like you get to a
funky winker bean you're
like what's going on here
yeah I bet it's a laugh
riot
yeah
Mallard Fillmore is
never going to get funny
yeah
the thing that probably
like lit my brain up the
absolute most in terms of
like I'm going to do this
was reading Life in Hell
when I was like
oh yeah
12 for the first time
getting like one of the
because I loved the
Simpsons like every other
yeah yeah
dumb shit head on earth
but like you know I'd like
I would like sit around
drawing watching the
Simpsons and I loved them
I loved it so much and I
was like obsessed with it
and I think my mom got me
one of the Life in Hell
books it was like this is
by the guy from the thing
and I was like oh cool and
I like I just obsessively
rereading those books over and
over and over and over and
over
yeah so I think I think that
like it just but that that
moment where you do see
something visually that
you're like this is this is
it it does when you've got
whatever kind of visual
processing thing I've got
that makes me draw it does
sort of drive you insane
yeah you know it does it
does kind of sound like
Richard Williams was also
driven insane by that I
mean he spent a lot of his
life trying to make this
movie called the thief and
the cobbler which was never
finished in its entirety until
it was by Harvey Weinstein
and the movie came out in
theaters and it was so
unsuccessful it was later
offered as a free DVD inside
of Froot Loops cereal yeah it
was it was like a disaster
because it was supposed to be
like his magnum opus and
every project and Pepsi man
yeah it's so it's so tragic
because like every project
that he did was to fund
thief and the cobbler including
Roger Rabbit and the cobbler
took like 30 years before yeah
it was eventually taken over by
a production bond company that
then finished it up and one of
the really notable things about
thief and the cobbler and about a
lot of Richard Williams animation
is that it's animated what we
call in on ones most Western
animation is generally done on
twos which means for every two
frames of film you have one
frame of animation Japanese
animation tends to be on threes
right so that's it's even fewer
frames per second so you have
24 frames of film every second
you have 12 frames of animation
not with Richard Williams you have
24 animated frames every single
second and the cobbler is
animated that way smooth as butter
when you're animating on ones but
it's very difficult to do when
you are hand drawing every single
frame but that's probably twice as
hard to make yeah but that's okay
because Richard Williams then cuts a
lot of corners wait a second that's
not right nope he has fully animated
backgrounds that move around oh he
has a written Vincent Price like
like a deck of cards and you see
every single card like in
traditional cell animation the
background is like a painting that
they just like left there yeah it's
like a set and then you just have
your animated characters yeah like
so yeah like you know he'll have
it actually in traditional
animation is like insane you just
never see it yeah he'll have it
actually rotating and yeah and
doing all this and he he does a
couple of those little flourishes at
the beginning of this movie too with
the the opening sequence of this
movie well I watched I watched
Roger Rabbit again on like Sunday
yeah you don't know what we're
recording I'll never tell you I
watched again the other day and that
opening sequence like I was watching
it as being this guy's fucking just
showing off yeah stunning well
because they spent so much money on
it too like he was able to like
actually play in this big sandbox I
think this quote kind of sums up
Williams pretty well this is
actually from the man himself I'm in
the same business as Goya and
Rembrandt I may be rotten at it with
nothing of the same quality or talent
but that's my business and he passed
away in 2019 after a long battle with
cancer
truly truly a a guy who did
everything his own way until the end
and he passed away working on another
lifelong project that he would never
finish which was his Lysistrata
adaptation
whoa the beginning of which he
packaged up as a short film and
finally won an Oscar for best short
subject called prologue
Matty I saw you pumping your fist
during that quote is this a common
mentality for cartoonists no but I
think the idea of like I work in a
sort of like fundamentally silly
genre that is not taken seriously
but I still apply like this sort of
like level of craft to it yeah is
really nice to hear someone talking
about that in a serious way yeah yeah
yeah and I'm also just pumping my
fist because like if you can be that
much of a weird prick but also still
like do what he did make a living at
it yeah that just feels like a thing
that is almost inaccessible now that
I'm like frankly very jealous of that
you could like make a living sort of
doing some animation for major
studios and like I just feel like
now it's just you have to the amount
of hustle you to put into being a
visual artist is like unheard of and
sucks the life out of you but I was
yeah so I just I just think that's a
kind of like an inspiring figure and
like a aspirational way to like live an
artistic life yeah yeah I mean and
there's there's sort of a thing now I
think somebody tweeted it out but it's
something I've kind of put into my my
soul which is like there is no making
it anymore in the arts you have to
constantly be making it over time and
to a certain extent I think Williams
falls into that category just because
he was constantly taking on more and
more side gigs to like fund this
massive project self-funding right so
he was taking all the all I mean
because he was making commercials he
was doing fine money-wise and then
not finding investors not doing and
then when he finds investors it ends
up screwing him because then they're
like well this movie needs to get done
we spend a bunch of money on sure but
for decades he would just pour his own
money I won't put money into this
unless you put a genie doing two
William F. Buckley impressions
two at minimum no so Matty you
referenced you referenced before that
this movie is a miracle in in a lot of
ways and I think that the it is a
miracle because it can only exist in
the time that it existed and at no
point thereafter or before because
Disney was on some really fucking hard
times at this point yeah black
cauldron had come out in 1985 and
bombed into the center of the earth
yeah like through this is two decades
basically that they are just
floundering because the 70s saw them
take I mean they were raiding their
archives and been and like Walt
Disney at one point wanted to make
Pete's dragon into a movie and then
was like no this is a bad idea and
then in like 76 they're like we're
gonna do Pete's dragon and it should be
noted Walt Disney died in 1966 yeah and
so at that point Roy took over the
company and he was not a creative
visionary in the way that Walt was no he
was always the business boy and you
know they were able to get Disney
world built and they were able to get
some ideas done but like Disney live
action was always kind of dog shit
sometimes in fun ways the cat from
outer space still kind of a banger
what's the dog DA one the shaggy
I think there is no better sequence
in film than when that dog cold clocks
that guy on the way out of that
building and but like that that's
emblematic of this very sad dark age
that Disney's in and their animated
movies are not really faring much
better even really solid movies like
the great mouse detective yes just
don't do very good business no like the
next year's Little Mermaid I think
right yeah after this yeah it's like
we're off to the races and we're in the
Renaissance like like modern Disney
that's the Michael Eisner era after
he came over from Paramount yeah and I
mean it's funny because the great
mouse detective comes out and then it's
like it probably would have done
better but then an American tale came
out yeah and like just obliterate the
competition also part of why
Spielberg you know Disney had the
rights to Roger Rabbit and Spielberg
with Amblin was like yeah we'll co
produce this thing I don't really
trust Disney to do the animation well
and that's why they went and got
Richard Williams really Richard
Williams very contemptible of Disney so
much that he was like I'm gonna
animate all this in England because I
don't want to be anywhere near the
mouse house yeah for it's also so
fascinating to have an animator that is
not a Disney guy but it's also not a
Bluth guy yeah it's like I feel like
secret third thing Bluth also worked on
Pete's dragon yeah another movie that
had hybrid live action and animated
sequences yeah and looks terrible and
is terrible and yeah and in a lot of
ways Jeffrey Katzenberg was just like
this studio is failing yeah let's go
back to basics which I guess means Mary
Poppins and Pete's dragon which is let's
put live action and animation next to
each other but in any other period of
time like they would not have been this
experimental with their IP especially
after the run of the run of the run of the
feels like I think similarly I think
about the film Lilo and Stitch that I
think is very fun and good yeah and is
animated very beautifully and like there's
all these interviews people who worked on
it and they're like we were at some
satellite animation studio and they did
not know what we were doing and they
left us alone and we kind of got away
with something and I think about that
with this movie where it's kind of like
no one was paying enough attention right
there wasn't any meddling it was kind of
like we're doing this thing we're just
kind of like they left them alone they
sort of got away with it on some level
yeah and a lot of that was because of
Spielberg's power sure right yeah he is
the king of the box office everybody
wanted to be in with Steven Spielberg
everybody wanted Spielberg to owe them a
favor everybody wanted to be in the
business of Spielberg which is why so
many different kinds of cartoons appear
in this it's not just Disney and Warner
Brothers right yeah we got Fleischer in
there yeah so I'm just gonna read the
whole list the fleischer guys
bopping around yeah it made me so happy
Spielberg I just imagine like Spielberg
going into all these studios like
busting down the doors and be like I
need Felix the cat
but we got like dusting off the cobwebs
like oh thank god somebody take him
please have the weird Hungarian
American Felix the cat movie come out
at this point oh that's a good question
I don't know a movie I watched so and I
think also on another TV very horny film
insanely fucked up movie where Felix the
cat is bopping around heavy metal for some
yeah that was 1989 which okay year after
after it was Roger Rabbit put Felix the
cat back on the map I'm wondering
because that movie is another seminal
thing to me visually I don't know why I
was like really obsessed with it and
there's like the guy looks like
Mysterio is the villain and he's like
rescuing like bikini babes like very
weird very horny movie and I think maybe
they saw the success of Roger
Roberts like whoa my god we can make
these horny let's do it hit us with the
list AJ I'm going to hungry right now so
we have um Fleischer Studios we got
Harvey Comics we got King Feature
Syndicate we got Felix the cat
productions yeah that's its own thing
very busy
I imagine Spielberg walked into like
three tumbleweeds just like assaulted
him on the way in just a single phone
that connects directly to Hungary just
one guy hello yes I am Felix the cat
it is me Felix give me bikini bag
Hungarian hexagraph this is going to
Russia
we have Turner Entertainment right this
was before Turner got rolled into
Warner Brothers yeah and then of course
we have Universal Pictures and
Walter Lance Productions so it was
basically Spielberg like use his immense
power to like cobble all this together and I
can't imagine there being a director
with that much power today to be able to
do that mostly because it's the
studios that have that power
Steven Spielberg when he did ready
player one
that's right
that is right
you know a true Robert Roger Rabbit
movie
honestly what I said before like it was
a miracle it was kind of a twofold
thing which was yeah the time and
place it was made but the other thing
is that it is not ready player one
yes and it could have been so could
have just been because of all this
like slop for the hog trough yeah
right it was not it's like it's
actually like everything's deployed in
a way that is interesting and funny
yeah all the polls are really
interesting because it's not like you
don't see everybody every big star
like some some of the background
characters are like the cows that
Walt Disney used to like to animate
honestly I love those cows yeah I think
I wanted one far side cow just for my
money I think the only animated movie
that is kind of managed to recapture
this since was the first Wreck-It Ralph
yeah not Wreck-It Ralph 2 yeah which is
a disaster broke the internet yeah all
of these characters are being brought
in to enhance the world yeah without
calling attention to themselves as
pieces of intellectual property the
point is that this is a coherent and
cohesive world where all of these
cartoon characters just happen to
coexist with each other I think the
only movie that has come close to
Roger Rabbit is the Chip and Dale movie
for me the most recent one that I think
Mulaney and Andy Samberg did together
it's basically it's a new it is a
noir set in a Hollywood where tunes
have their own sort of thing the
villain of that turns out to be the
original Sonic design with the weird
teeth it is a deeply strange you're
describing a real you know this came out
on Disney plus you can watch it right
now it's like you mean the from the
movie Sonic yes from the from the
interesting yeah yeah the weird Sonic
yeah it's called he's called ugly Sonic
in the middle of that is real yeah it's
yeah that's that's the judge june of that
movie so fun watching this real honestly
it's a pretty good time it's not Roger
Rabbit but like it yeah trying to do
very much the same thing you look at
like Deadpool and Wolverine it's all like
jokes about like the stuff that the
studio is doing right and it's like that
it's not that I guess it's funny if you
followed the fucking news about the
movie being made like but the that what
that does is it completely bails out the
stakes of everything happening right
you're just like when someone's just
yelling you're watching a movie you're
watching a movie it's like well but if
they're like you're watching like we're
in a movie and you're watching that
like I don't know just feels yeah
because this is a subtle distinction
what Roger Rabbit does deep a world
that yeah yeah it makes it like oh yeah
you know when all the cartoons are
being made that's just this era of old
Hollywood where there was a ghetto
that was full of cartoon characters
different kind of labor explanation
actors I mean to compare it to another
thing you know hail Caesar similar
kind of thing where it's you know
taking this coherent world and
applying a new filter to it that makes
you recontextualize the history of
that moment and brings in real
contemporary history in a weird and
twisted way and we're going to talk
more about this when we recap the
movie but yeah would that it were so
simple Josh yeah we just get
tripping we got well speaking of
casting because we've we would not
talk about several of the tunes that
are in this movie I wanted to talk a
little bit about the alternate
choices that they had for the leads
of this movie yeah so in the very
earliest versions of this when they
had different directors and stuff
attached to it yeah you know in their
1981 1982 Pete Renaday was the guy
playing Eddie Valiant and right Renaday
is a guy that has come up on this
podcast because he's a frequent voice
actor on adventures and odyssey he's
that really dark-sided Iowa farm dad
yeah yeah he was that was one of the
scariest characters in adventures and
odyssey he is a totally not a star he
is just a fucking longtime voice actor
who has done everything yeah the first
thing that comes up here is the go
bots wiki
but yeah then yeah when they're actually
making the movie Pete Renaday was never
considered for the final thing he just
was doing the test stuff yeah and Paul
Rubens did a couple of test things as
Roger yeah but and then from then to
the point where the movie came out his
career exploded Pee Wee's Playhouse
yeah yeah came out and and and so he
changed the world yeah and so it's before
the Charles Fleischer in the role of
Roger yeah thing about fun thing about
Charles Fleischer is that he would show
up every day on set wearing a giant
rabbit outfit yeah he made them make a
costume for him so he could do the lines
and people would have something to
respond to and sounds like he was a bit
much on set yeah it does they don't
talk about him with like a smile on
the sole exception is Christopher Lloyd
who has nothing but really wonderful
things to say about him but Christopher
Lloyd is also at a time in his life
where he has nice things to say about
everybody Lloyd is also a cartoon
character whenever he walks onto set so
they were vibing they were imagine
being Christopher Lloyd right now would
you have anything bad to say about
anything that's ever happened
vibing really wonderful YouTube video
I'm not sure if it's still around but
it had like 500 views Christopher Lloyd
did a community theater production of
death of a salesman in like his
hometown and there's just this YouTube
video just somebody with a camcorder
and there's a crowd of people around him
and he's just sitting in a chair and
they're like and they're very close to
him like they're like like it's like
he's like holding court and they're
like what's it like to play Willie
Lohman he's like it's the greatest
thing I've ever done in my life and I
was it's just it's very heartwarming
it's so funny because like in the 70s
he was around here in New York as like
if you did a Brecht play he was in it
for some reason didn't matter who was
directing it what if it was at BAM if
it was at the public wherever
Christopher Lloyd was in every single
Brecht production wow that's cool he's
just a cool guy yeah cool guy and
here's some other cool guys we got
Spielberg originally wanted Harrison
Ford to be Eddie Valiant that work
which I think would be I think it would
be great because he would not give in
to any of the sentimentality in the way
that Hoskins also doesn't right you
know he would treat the he would
probably treat Roger with the right
amount of contempt in order to make
the movie work but their second pick
was one Chevy chase absolutely not
which would have destroyed this movie
entirely no he would have been too
clownish third we got Bill Murray same
problem I think yeah who who missed the
opportunity because in order to book
Bill Murray for a gig during this time
and maybe still still he still has this
you'll call him directly you still call
him directly he's got his own toll-free
number his own toll-free number and I
guess he just missed the message you
didn't know about this Maddie no yeah
I'll bill hey I don't know you see
just a thing people know about yeah
when he used to go around Brooklyn and
just show up at people's parties right
yeah yeah and he would take people's
fries off their plates and say no one
would ever right it turns out a lot of
people believe them yeah it's quite
wrong I think I saw him on the street
the other day but you took one of your
fries yeah I don't believe you so uh
so Eddie Murphy also got offered the role
and he was like I don't understand these
tunes thing and then he later went oh I
should have done that I think Eddie
Murphy would have been actually really
good in the movie I can't I really I
really can't see anyone except for Bob
Hoskins out of that set of people yeah
you need a guy who plays King Lear in
there oh yeah it's funny you brought up
Hail Caesar because it's a very Cohen-esque
pitch the whole movie yeah that's what I
was thinking about I was like it is like
what's happening is funny nobody is
making jokes right yeah which is like
like stuff that is funny is happening
yeah everybody's taking everything
deathly serious right yeah and even the
ones who are making jokes are doing so
because their tunes and they have to
like yeah like Roger can't help it like
it's a horrible yeah yeah it makes
everyone around him upset look at the
all rabbits you laugh at this
right so like having having a guy like
this is literally the cones exclude
almost exclusively try to get people
have done Shakespeare yeah okay yeah it
is a similar pitch of like talking very
specifically in a way that is funny but
not jokey yeah yeah playing the text and
being trained on technique exactly so
like but like so having a guy like
Hoskins is I feel like so integral to
the movie absolutely and and just to
show you they had no idea what to do
with Eddie Valiant here's the here's
just a quick list of everyone else who
was considered Robin Williams Charles
Grodin Don Lane Jack Nicholson Sylvester
Stallone Edward James almost Ed Harris and
Wallace Shawn huh Wally would have been
good I think Wally would have killed it
yeah Bob Hoskins is the one you know I
don't know there's just something about
him I'm sure in like the screen test you
just saw Roger come alive just by his
acting Charles Grodin I could sort of see
it just because he's so fucking good and
great Muppet caper but again I think the
reason he works so well in that is that
he is bringing a certain cartoonishness to
it which is not what you want for this
role absolutely not he's not a tune you
want a guy who's rumpled yeah Hoskins is
rumpled smell the whiskey big big way
well it's funny because it's like this it's
this is a stock character that Hoskins
has at this point he's played this
grizzled American detective I always
forget that Bob Hoskins is British yeah
but basically this the film wraps and
then it spends 14 months in post-production
which is way shorter than I would have
thought so much shorter considering
everything they had to do that would
describe that as with an animation and
an animated film production yeah that's
that's start time because yeah well and
and you can see this with some of the
like special features that they had on
the DVD and everything like they're
really not animating until it's all
finished filming they're not in the you
know when you do something that has a
lot of CGI not so much today because of
the way that we're doing things now but
like generally it's like oh you have a
bunch of special effects that has to be
planned out in pre-pro all that is set
out a long time ago but with this the
animation is like well we're gonna see
what you got with your robots and
everything and then we're gonna put
stuff on top of it and you can see
Zemeckis has such a clear vision for
what the animation is and he's just
walking through each scene with
Williams and being like this is what
Roger's gonna be doing here oh here
he's gonna get a little springy or
here you know like it's crazy and
setting up little visual things here
and there there will be pieces of the
set that move in certain ways something
gets hit something gets pushed
something that gets moved and all of
that is going to give the animators the
ability to track that shit when they
are putting the final product together
oh but I was thinking about the there's
the scene where Eddie and Roger like
handcuffed together and he keeps
dunking Roger in the sink yeah yeah
watching that scene all I could think
about was like there's so much shit
yeah like the jalopy of this scene that
they're trying to like hold together of
like yeah the weasels are walking
around doing stuff right like causing
stuff in the set like sacks of paper to
fall over and my door is open and Eddie's
like dunking this camera is moving the
whole time like the amount of shit they
had to do and also the guns are
floating they're all puppeteered on
little strings yeah that's the thing is
like they got real puppeteers to work
on this they realize pretty quickly we
can't just have a stagehands doing this
although there are a few stagehands who
do some pretty incredible work everyone
is doing incredible work the extras are
amazing in this movie truly like but for
like a lot of the floating objects like
someone's carrying a gun it's a cartoon
weasel they have actual marionette tears
up in catwalks above this so cool just
dancing the object around for the
penguin waiters they have trays on
sticks with little slots in the ground
for them to be able to walk through
like you know how the newest planet of
the apes you can watch it now without
any of the CGI can you just watch the
performances of the guy playing
gorillas and stuff that rocks I really
wish that there was something like that
for Roger rabbit there's some videos of
like people of like how the setups work
yeah I would just love to watch the
entire movie yeah it was it was really
incredible to me to watch this movie and
like there was like there was one special
effect I thought was not great that was
for the whole movie yeah which is when
Eddie goes to toontown and he's holding
a cartoon gun oh yeah and because of the
logistics of that he starts holding a prop
gun that looks like a cartoon gun it looks
really stupid and bad and I'm kind of like
I was like oh that looks bad but I was
like wait there's like 700 effect shots in
this movie yeah and also it's from the 80s
one looks bad which is 1988 like yeah
it's unreal and also to get rid of that
gun pretty quick
not gonna deal with that you can you can
watch pretty much the whole toontown
sequence that Bob Hoskins goes through
without the special effects there is
someone who put that on YouTube and
piece together all the behind the scenes
and he's just on a blue screen right like
he's just a void yeah but like you can
watch him hanging from the flagpole and
just prying his own fingers off of the
flagpole one by one that's you know like
cool
really so jealous yeah his ability as an
actor yeah it's this movie is it's just a
goddamn magic trick and it releases on
June 22nd 1988 and it's a huge hit yeah
351 million worldwide in 1988 I mean this
revitalizes animation yeah yeah people
start clamoring for more animated
commercials more animated TV shows of
course Spielberg goes on to produce some
of the best animated TV shows gonna say
like tune time yeah after years and years
and years of fucking Hanna-Barbera
everyone was sick of that shit no one
liked making it no one liked watching it
no one liked acting in it like it just
sucked yeah and then all of a sudden you
have one of the most complicated pieces
of animation come out it's super super
successful and it makes people want to
see more cartoons yeah and then we get
cool world
cool world
did we have we ever talked about
Flintstones on the rocks which is sort
of like the death knell I think for me of
like Flintstones movies it was about the
Flintstones getting a divorce it's like
the worst thing I've ever seen in my life
no it was a cartoon it was a Hanna-Barbera
like they ran Flintstones into the ground
because they did you know Flintstones
meet the Jetsons which is actually okay
pretty okay but then they did like the
variety show series where Pebbles and
Bam Bam are teenagers and it's mostly
like Captain Caveman sketches horrible
nonsense Fred and Wilma get divorced
almost I mean wouldn't you leave Fred
yeah I mean I would leave Fred in a
fucking instant so yeah it wins four
Academy Awards including one for our
main man Richard Williams yeah he gets a
special award for that yeah because what
they've done here is basically magic and
yeah spoilers for the rest of this
really great movie perhaps one of my
favorite movies I've ever seen in my life
one yeah this was tailor-made for me I
know and I watched this when I was 10
years old this would have been my entire
personality yeah up until this very
moment you probably would have dated a
lot more redheads I dated a lot of
redheads I know even more so let's talk
about who framed Roger Rabbit yeah who
did it the movie no things let's find out
this so this movie opens with what is
basically a pastiche Looney Tune in this
world there's something called the baby
Herman cartoons yes baby Herman is as
one would expect a baby yeah cute little
sort of like sweet pea in the Popeye
cartoons yeah cute little baby who's
always getting into all sorts of trouble
and Roger Rabbit is the baby's
caretaker yeah he was rescued from a
laboratory is that the lore and she says
something like or it's like back to the
lab with you right and so we get just to
open the movie this phenomenal sequence
that is just on its own as a short this
is one of the best of this like genre
yeah I've ever seen yeah this is right on
the level of like the very best Tom and
Jerry cartoons Richard Williams being
totally on his bullshit yes it's like
checkerboards
checkerboards everything's rotating around the
perspective reflections the perspective is
insane and like although these really like
obscure angles of like the room that the
dimensions of it are like there's the box of
knives that flips over and every knife is
unique
yes it's a different color handle and shape
shining and like showing reflections so
just to kind of lay down what is going on
here baby Herman is loose in the kitchen
trying to trying to get into the cookie
jar yeah and Roger Rabbit is doing
everything in his power to protect baby
Herman from the various lethal obstacles
that stand baby Herman's way yeah but of
course because it's a cartoon the baby's
totally safe and Roger keeps getting
injured right classic baby's day out stuff
what if Magoo was being protected by a
ghost and I like that baby Herman's mom is
like the the later Tom and Jerry cartoons
yeah where it's just yeah you just see her
hosiery and the bottom of her skirt just
curious to hear like on the technicals
Maddie because obviously being somebody who
draws yeah all the time what jumped out at
you visually about all of this we talked
about a little bit but like other big
things I mean honestly it was just like the
sort of like the fundamental animation of
it is so good like the squashing and
stretching they do on Rogers like incredible
the way that he moves is like so smooth
and I don't know I doubt they did this one
on the ones because that'd be too much
money probably I think this one is on the
way I could go back I could go back and
watch and go frame by frame but yeah like
I remember even being as a kid being like
completely struck by the way the sequence
worked it's just like it moves so smoothly
and it's so good and like it's shaded in a
way that animation is very rarely allowed to
be lit yeah like it's a really incredible
lighting just like fundamentally like a
perfect piece of animation yeah and it's
got those little jokes in there too right
where it's like from the classic text
savory things it's all a lot of sign
jokes yeah so there's a lot of stuff like
the the oven is called hotter and hell
and then the heat settings on it are
volcano heat and then the one after that
is well done it's such a good little thing
and then like the vacuum is called a
suckalux and very importantly all of
these items come from acme there's a mistake
at the end because roger rabbit doesn't
it starts improvising yep not his lines but
the little things that go around his head
he has birdies and not stars stars he's
fucked it all up and so this is presumably
all shot in one take that's what they like
yeah they do the entire sequence and then
because he has the wrong thing swirling
they're like well fuck we have to do it all
every episode of baby herman is an homage
to rope because now the really watch out
baby herman immediately we break the frame
here we're not in a cartoon anymore now
roger of course is a cartoon but his head
is in the middle of a real refrigerator
yeah and he is talking to a real director
yeah and this is what we hear cut cut cut cut cut what
the hell was wrong with that tank nothing
with you baby herman you were great you
were perfect you were better than perfect
just roger he keeps blowing his lines
roger what's this a tweeting bird a tweeting bird
roger read this look what it says it says
rabbit gets clunked rabbit sees stars not birds stars
can we lose the playback please
i'm struggling you're killing me
how the hell many times do we have to do this damn scene
oh i'm being my trailer taking a nap
excuse me don't strike
and all of this is one take
yeah this is a giant yeah spielberg-esque wonder
when they started working on this movie
they were talking to animators and like yeah
you're gonna have to keep the camera static
so that you can animate it properly
and then richard williams who is insane
was like yeah oh no you can move the camera
i did a commercial once where we move the camera
we can do that
yeah yeah so he just never stops
the amount of camera movement
that was the other thing that really struck me about the movie
just generally was like
the camera never stops moving
yes
and the animation keeps up in a way that's like
i just
yes well
i don't know it's superhuman
it's crazy
the thing about the camera movement
is that the camera is moving
in the way that cartoons move
yeah
yeah
it is mimicking the style of it too
and it is also very interesting that
as the movie goes along
and as bob hoskins character eddie valiant
starts becoming more like you know
fond of the tunes
a lot of the shots with him in the initial thing
are actually pretty
like stagnant on him
on him
yes
and then as the film goes along
they get more manic
as he starts adapting to it
just want to do a quick shout out here
that director
the character's name is Raul J. Raul
and he is played by Joel Silver
Joel Silver
yeah
that is famous mega producer Joel Silver
that's like the most meta joke that they get with it here
there's one coming up in the next scene
that i thought was very silly
but yeah
we follow baby herman
exactly
that voice that we heard there
that is the real voice
of baby herman
he is not in fact
this small sweet angel baby
he's a grown ass man
this feels almost like an archetypal joke
at this point
yeah
but like this must be the first instance of that
or something like
and it does it really well
there used to be an old joke
that Shirley Temple was 40 years old
and they kept her short with coffee and cigarettes
yes
and so i think it's kind of like
yeah it's like riffing on that
or like Mickey Rooney
who was just like
you know he was always very short
he could play young for a long time
but he was just like this nasty little pervert
always
and everyone hated him
it's the simpsons stunt doubles
from that one episode
where it gets adopted by Mr. Burns
yeah
yeah
like the Romanian
stunt doubles
yeah
so it is Hollywood
1947
we see this in a subtitle
and R.K. Maroon
the head of Maroon Cartoons
has a problem on his hands
namely
these fucking
baby herman cartoons
keep going over budget
because Roger Rabbit
can't fucking keep his shit straight
and so
what he has done here
is he has called in
a private investigator
named Eddie
Eddie Valiant
Eddie Valiant
played by Bob Hoskins
no relation to Prince Valiant
true
I looked it up
and
ultimately
he has a plan
for what he can do
what Eddie can do
to help get Roger
focused
and back on track
how much do you know
about show business
Mr. Valiant
only there's no business like it
no business of no
damn it
there's no business more expensive
I'm 25 grand over budget
on the latest baby herman cartoon
you saw the rabbit blowing his lines
he can't keep his mind in his work
you know why
one too many refrigerators
dropped on his head
ah he's a toon
you can drop anything you want
on his head
he'll shake it off
the break is hard
goes to pieces
just like you or me
read that
this dialogue is so good
yes
seen cooing over calamari
with not so new sugar daddy
was Jessica Rabbit
wife of maroon cartoon star Roger
what's this gotta do with me
you're the private detective
you figure it out
look I don't have time for this
look Valiant
his wife's poison
but he thinks she's Betty Crocker
I want you to follow her
give me a couple of nice juicy pictures
I can wise the rabbit up with
forget it
I don't want toon town
what's wrong with toon town
every Joe loves toon town
you get Joe to do the job
cause I ain't
god
so we've already talked a fair bit
about the quality of the animation
and we'll continue to do so
but I just wanted to take a moment
to praise the script
this is really seminal
this is a really
it's the same root
you say seminal when referring to semen
no but it was written by
it was written by semen
that's why it's a semenal film
it was written in semen
it was written in gum
disappearing and reappearing semen
you gotta write quick
that shit solidifies
it's so efficient
it's Hollywood efficient
yes
almost too much
but the absurdity of it all
that's right
is what grounds it
the pitch of this thing
is like so perfect
like the whole
like I don't know
if you've seen Twister
for instance
I finally watched Twister
for the first time
the original Twister
and there's a part
where they're like
they're reminiscing
about all the storms
they're chasing
like oh yeah
the cat threes
those were nuts
oh and the cat fours
those were even more nuts
and then like
the new wife
of the guy
who's planning
to leave the business
of storm chasing
she's like
well what about
a category five
and then Helen Hunt
like has to get up
from the table
and everyone's like
we don't talk about
category fives
and here it's just
yeah it's like the
yeah
what's wrong with that
oh his brother
was killed by a toon
yeah
yeah but it's
also done in that
sort of very
in this very particular voice
which you know
then it puts your mind
into a certain thing
and also if that
didn't do it
then perhaps the prop
in the background
which is the literal
Maltese falcon
which is just one of
the awards in the
background
might clue you in
because you know
they took a lot of
inspiration for this
from Chinatown
but they kind of
wanted to like
make it into a
prototypical noir
at one point
one of the drafts
of this script
was a treatment
for a Chinatown sequel
huh
wow
yeah
and then the two
jakes happen
they're like
ah we're not
gonna pop
maybe three jakes
but they're locked
the fuck in
right
yeah
but Hoskins saying
it's like no business
I know
is like the most
perfect line reading
imaginable
I don't
yeah
there's no fucking
wink in it at all
no
not a
it's almost like
he doesn't want
to say it
and that's what I
think is the most
important sort of
piece that makes
this side of the
film work
imagine Chevy Chase
saying that
oh
or like if they
were doing
like if they were
doing the fucking
Ryan Reynolds wink
right
this would be
unwatchable
but they're taking
it so
like no business
I know
but they're taking
it so fucking
seriously
I wish
everyone listening
could see the face
you just
the Ryan Reynolds
it's like the
shittiest little face
it's like you were
taking over by the
ghost of this film
I think
that we are
gonna have to go
to Toontown
pretty soon
no
and once we get
there
what
kind of looks
like 70s
Ted Bundy
well okay
okay
side tangent
Ryan Reynolds
there is kind
of a dead
like behind
the eyes
thing with him
sometimes
that does
he's a little
unnerving
is Ryan Reynolds
unnerving
in his weird
personality
it is
it is very
funny in
watching Wrexham
where there are
moments where
like actual
like emotion
comes through
and then you
see him just
like shove
it down
and it's
it's
it's
I don't know
it's
if you were
in this movie
I would have
I would burn
every copy
he would have
been far
too young
Ryan Reynolds
played baby
Herman
in this film
but
just to
teach him
how to smoke
just to extend
sort of like
you know
how back and
forth this movie
is you know
expertly bouncing
ping pong like
between the
animated piece
and the live
action piece
we get this
phenomenal
visual animated
gag here
where fucking
Dumbo
shows up
outside the window
jump scare
Dumbo
like that Dumbo
the elephant
you're watching
the Hollywood
backlot
and so you're
seeing all the
actor you know
it's like
watching Hail
Caesar and you're
just seeing a
bunch of guys
dressed as
centurions and
then a bunch of
guys dressed as
pharaohs or
whatever
and again just
to emphasize how
well these two
pieces work together
you know Bob
Hoskins like goes
under the desk
because he's so
afraid of Dumbo
but then Maroon
sort of calms him
down be like hey
don't worry about
it they just hang
out you know what
they work for
peanuts and then
of course you get
a gag of him
throwing peanuts
out at Dumbo
and you see Dumbo
eating the
nuts and going
down into the
backlight it's
like this is
magical it is
magical and also
because there's a
bunch of plants
around the window
and when Dumbo
flies past them
the plants go
they part and
it's just everything
everything there's
a part where
where Roger later
is like pounding
on the desk he's
just hitting his
fist on it and
you can see
objects just sort
of subtly shaking
like they don't
do this level of
care is not there
now when they
just CGI shit in
they don't worry
about it and
everything feels
fake right yeah
nothing has weight
yeah wait that's
the word yeah
and there's there's
a whole part where
he's like right
before the Dumbo
jump scare where
there's like we
talk about the
extras in this
movie right they're
unloading these
crates full of
instruments that are
also tunes and they
drop them and then
the tunes start like
running around and
you see the extras
each one of them
responding in turn to
a different instrument
and then actually
catching them one
guy like the
saxophone really
fucks up one of the
guys I'm really
worried about that
one crewman you
see a bunch of the
fantasia ballerina
animals around yes
and the hippo sits
on the thing and the
guy goes like skyrocketing
again he doesn't come
back down he's just in
space such a good
visual payoff for a
spoken setup where he's
like yes hey don't
worry about it we got
all the the the guys
from fantasia on loan
and then you see the
fucking brooms from
the magician's nephew
sequence in the hippo
and it's like this movie
is so tight and it's
so funny because of
course in old Hollywood
your studio had the
contract to the actor
so it wasn't like you
make a contract per
movie it's like well I
have my five picture
deal over at MGM I
can't do Warner
Brothers unless they
loan me out and for
this movie they
actually had to get
cartoon characters
loaned out to them in
real life yeah this is
so fun so Bob Hoskins
or should I say Eddie
takes the job he does
decide to do it for a
hundred dollars yeah
because he's short on
money he he has a bar
tab he has to take care
of and so he hops on a
trolley uh and takes it
over to a bar where his
beloved Dolores works
yeah he's he rides on the
back with some 14 year old
tramps yeah yeah and he
says you know who needs a
car in LA we have the
greatest public transit
system in the world and
importantly this is like a
moment where we've seen
him be like very like he
does not like tunes right
but this is not a bad guy
right he helps that kid
onto the trolley it's the
save the cat moment of
the movie yeah and it's a
funny joke for people in
the know about Los Angeles
at that time and what
happens but no it's also
the plot of the movie
right it's both because
this movie is constantly
working on multiple levels
and yeah there's a throw
away gag where they have
these cigarettes but then
they bring it back because
Bob Hoskins is like hey
kids thanks for the
cigarettes so yeah he is
now at the bar with
Dolores and like I said he
and Dolores have a
romantic history together
right but it seems that
at some point there was a
big traumatic moment that
kind of fractured the
relationship because he
has a real sore spot about
tunes tomorrow's Friday
Eddie you know what
happens here on Friday
fish special my boss checks
the books on Friday and if
I don't have that money I
gave you back in the till I'm
gonna lose my job don't
bust a button Dolores you've
only got one left 50 bucks
where's the rest well it's
only a snoop job away you
got that camera yours mine's
in the shop wouldn't be the
pawn shop any chance would it
oh come on Dolores you need
the other 50 I need the
camera just like heart
condition this camera and
the film that is already in
it becomes a I'm not a
major plot point but an
important character beat for
him and this is a a folding
postcard format camera which
usually your viewfinder is a
little prism on the lens
itself so you kind of look
over the camera to take your
picture and so here Hoskins
has to kind of fudge it and
just sort of pretend that he's
looking through it when he's
taking the pictures later so
what we hear in this in this
moment is that he would
normally never take a gig like
this he doesn't work with
tunes he doesn't work for
tunes and we discover in this
scene what the reason is for
that so what's his problem
tune killed his brother
dropped the piano on his head
so again economy of writing
yeah we now have his entire
motivation most of the
backstory that we need we know
who he is as a character and
why we ought to care about him
and we're ready to go along for
the ride at this point I think
I can't believe that we've only
covered two Bob Hoskins movies
on this podcast and in both of
them he is a grisly detective
who is racist against a
minority yes but he played that
role a number of times yeah it
was his bread and butter they
really they really do racialize
the hell out of the tunes here
which is interesting considering
you know like animations like
sort of checkered past with
regards to like yeah minstrelry
minstrelry yeah gloves they make
roger's gloves yellow they make
yeah I noticed that I was like
that's a really interesting
choice to make them you know
because it was before it was
sort of in the public
consciousness again that like
this was directly downstream of
minstrel performing right right
right the movie seems very aware
of it like it makes the cotton
club you know yeah Eddie needs to
go and get some sort of
compromising photographs of
Jessica Jessica is Roger
Rabbit's wife yeah and so he heads
down to the piano bar where
Jessica is going to be
performing and then we get one
of the most insane shots in
cinema history of Donald Duck and
Daffy Duck doing a piano duel
playing physical piano sitting on
physical benches that are all
rocking and moving these are
getting pressed accurately even if
it was just an animated sequence
the animation would be so good
and like there's such funny stuff
happening like I think it's
Donald plays the piano with his
ass and his tail turns into a
finger because this is what's so
good about this is that it's not
just a visual gag this is grounded
in the specificities of Donald and
Daffy who are basically alternate
versions of each other yeah it's
grounded in the best cartoons that
were ever made which are all the
ones where a Looney Tunes character
plays a piano it's also I believe the
Tex Avery Daffy Duck who's like the
best looking yes because a different
head shape he's got a different
head shape he's a lot more noodley
yeah yeah it's like almost
flexuring his noodliness but it's
like my favorite design of Daffy who's
like way more of like a demon it
almost didn't make it into the movie
either oh shit so it's a hard thing to
negotiate yeah so Zemeckis actually
had to have the entire other Daffy
animation created with really other
design in order to get this one in the
movie that's incredible really yeah
because then they showed them back to
back and there was a lot with like
yeah Daffy and Donald had to have
similar amounts of screen time
Mickey and Bugs Bunny had to have
like the exact same amount of screen
time yeah yeah and it's important that
the piano duel ends in a stalemate
right yeah but it's this extraordinary
like naval battle it was like they
master and commander the stage
briefly and Donald for some reason
puts on a pair of devil horns yeah it's
such like a like a incredible sort of
visual and yeah like experiential thing
in the movie but it's also like such a
good like world building thing yeah
they get like carted off because at the
end it's like no it's like a vaudeville
act right and it's also like about like
the labor situation for cartoons and
also like I mentioned that they're in the
cotton club for cartoons right where all
the performers are tunes all the
clientele are human beings yeah right
walk around in the real world but they
can yes come up through a tunnel or
something up into this speakeasy right
where they're acting on stage they're
working as bartenders yeah they're
serving you know they go in the back
lot and they go to yeah I can't remember
the name of the club is but like that's
it yeah and they're serving a bourbon on
the rocks with actual rocks I love that
they have Eddie Valiant realize what's
gonna happen because he's had enough
experience with cartoons like ice yeah
that's funny right that's funny right
but the octopus bartender I love the
octopus bartender is marionette
puppeting oh my god the glasses in the
air it is a real glass I know I just I
liquid there's all it's real flow and
you got yeah you got all the trays and
those are the stick puppets you know
coming up from the ground and then you
have Betty Boop coming by as a waitress
says hi he's like washed up Betty Boop
black and white drawn together Betty Boop
the thing about Betty Boop here right is
that she's no longer the hotness she
still kind of has it but there's somebody
out there who's much hotter and then of
course Eddie actually have like a
positive relationship to yeah reasonably
you know they know each other yeah but
the reason of course that she's no longer
the hottest person the hottest lady the
hottest gal is that there's a much
hotter gal and that of course is
Jessica Rabbit oh well you see
entering it's like high-heeled shoe you
know calf and then just can just just
they enter before the rest of her does I
think it should come as no surprise to
our listeners that Roger Ebert loved
this movie
so let's talk a little bit here about
this sequence because Jessica Rabbit
performs a solo number here in the
target of this performance is of
course Marvin Acme the guy who
founded the Acme Corporation which
provides all sorts of dangerous
devices for cartoons also seems to own a
lot of land that's right he owns all of
Toontown yeah he is he is their Lord
Regent but at the same time he has a
positive relationship with these tunes
and what I love about the performance
for Marvin Acme is that he has one of
the most cartoonish performances by
Stubby K who played nicely nicely in
Guys and Dolls on Broadway and in the
movie with Brandon you're rocking the
boat
he's not the used car salesman Jack
big fat tie
enjoy buzzers Eddie he's got the the
cologne that he like sprays on the
old-fashioned cologne thing it's it's
really lovely and it's like initially
that's what the performance is for it's
Jessica Rabbit I'm coming out and
performing for Acme singing voice who is
Amy Irving it's it's Amy Irving
uncredited my queen both Jessica both
Jessica rabbits really are uncredited
spoken voice Kathleen Turner she's
uncredited yeah just and also just
amazing performances but over the
course of Turner turns in an actual
like cartoon voice you know it's not
just there it's again like every
animated movie now is just a handful of
celebrities it's just Chris Pratt
being Chris Pratt
you don't like listening to Chris
Pratt
it's a ghost of a whispered Italian
accent hey it's me Mario hey everybody
it's me
Mario from Brooklyn but like Kathleen
Turner is doing Mario old-timey
cartoon voice acting yes she
understands the assignment yeah and
this was also you know this was pre
Aladdin right and I feel like from
Aladdin on it was more about
capitalizing on the celebrity like
voice acting talent I suppose but even
then like I feel like a lot of the
Disney Renaissance movies still have
very distinctive voices like the
late 2000s before I feel like it was
more DreamWorks DreamWorks on the
range was really kind of the turning
point Toy Story also bad for this yeah
yeah CGI yeah Tim Allen are also
doing cartoon voices in Toy Story they
are but it was also like we getting
names became the thing at first they
were doing voices and now it's just
like right now every cartoon has
Tim Allen well I mean Hanks is coming
back for Toy Story 5 and I'm like
that's not the whole point of 4 was
that he's gone so what was the
Toy Story 4 is that he's gone we can't
talk about Toy Story right now we have
to focus on Roger Rabbit that's true
that is true the thing that notoriously
has no sequels Jessica's appearance
on this stage is so cool they have yes
sequined dress oh my god they had no
idea if they could do it or not and
they're like let's fucking try it
the motherfuckers pulled it off it's
actually sparkling they keyed in this
sparkly sparkly situation over her
animatic and it's one of the most
beautiful things I've ever seen in any
animation it was I felt so gay watching
this because I was like you know yeah
sure she's got boobs or whatever but
that dress honey also it is funny that
she goes up to Bob Hoskins and her boob
is the exact size and shape of Bob
Hoskins head well it's funny because
she's like got two Hoskins under there
she's so exaggerated right she's like
it's like is this even sexy like right
like it goes a step further like the
way she looks from the side is like is
preposterous like she just doesn't have
a waist at all looks like a valentine
heart like odd hairline it's it's
fascinating because like I think that's
when they say oh we didn't know if we
could get away with it it wasn't just
like can we get away with making her
sexy it's like can we get away with
going beyond sexy into whatever this is
into a more cartoonish yeah because
it's not like Don Bluth sexy where it's
like okay yeah you got the big cans
the big nips and everything yeah it's
like this is this it just it's it's like
a parody of it so Maddie you had
mentioned you know having various
awakenings as a result of watching
things as a child was Jessica Rabbit
that for you or not no I was more just
like I was I was fascinated by the way
she moved more than anything yeah she's
not like I don't think she's like hot
right like attracted to Jessica I feel
the same way yeah I think but I think
that's on purpose right because I think
the idea is that like she because like
what is that the like the space in the
world for her performance yeah if anything
but just like exists like drive men
insane yeah so she's there is just sort
of like an avatar of like quote-unquote
sexiness more than she is like to me hot
yeah it's really Betty Boop because
it's like Betty Boop was supposed to be
the sexiest fucking shit on screen
I'm also not a cartoon fucker like I
sure you're sure I don't find most
drawings hot right okay okay okay
because they're drawings I feel like
that's unusual for people in the comics
and animation field I feel like there's a
lot of no it's yeah just absolute like
yeah okay and now I'm gonna need to make
the honk off version of this just for
myself I'm not I'm not horny for the
Robin Hood Fox or whatever I just I
does none of this stuff Canada's own
Brian Bedford
star of the Stratford festival in Grand
Prix
yeah what everyone talks about the
the Robin Hood Fox are obviously
talking about the voice actor
yeah exactly I could hardly handle his
importance of being earnest because I'm
so busy tracking
I've always found the fingers on the
foxes in Robin Hood to ruin it for me
it's like I'm doing good and then I see
the fingers and I'm out Brian just
holds up a note card in front of the
screen
no thank you
no thank you
yeah
to block the fingers
yeah
to block the fingers
like
put a note into the screen
like
no thank you
I've written this right
call again tomorrow
call again tomorrow thank you
but yes Jessica Rabbit here is the
avatar of sexiness yeah in the tune
world yeah and the thing that is so
uh titillating about her of course
yeah
she's got big cans
that's right
is that she also has some appeal to
humans and one of these humans is
Mr. Acme himself
yeah
and uh after the show uh Jessica goes
backstage and Marvin shows up at her
dressing room and wouldn't you know it
they start playing patty cake
patty cake patty cake
is that true
take comfort son you're not the first
man his wife played patty cake on him
uh this is
there's just literally
you're literally playing patty cake
there's this phenomenal gag where
Roger has the photographs
um and you know flips between them
fast enough that it becomes an
animation
that's so fun
of Jessica and Acme playing patty cake
yeah
I kind of love that the photographs and the
newspaper photos and stuff right that's an
earlier phase in production so her model is like
slightly different
yeah yeah yeah
I don't know why that appeals to me so much
I just like the fact that like aha
ooh then I can see the process here
oh yeah yeah yeah
uh so my question for the room is like is this how
tunes are born
no
if you move pictures fast enough
do they like
no
arise from the page
they're brought from the stork
okay
look out for Mr. Stork
oh that's right of course that is that is actually
so is there a boss baby
uh situation
I'm talking about old classic cartoons
AJ
right right they do come from the story
from Walter Elias Disney
and or
Ub Iwerks
Ub Iwerks
yeah and so
hey
the real
the real man behind the scenes
yeah
Ub heads
rise
rise up
grab your notions
don't have to tell me twice
but Roger does not take this news obviously well
and they're like you know what you need Roger
booze
which is fairly common for the old cartoons
like oh yeah there were a bunch of alcohol gags
they would take it and then you know steam come out their ears
or they would just get like really blotto and like move all around the screen
yeah
but it's not as common in like more recent animation
well and that's because old animation is for adults
right
it was something that you saw before a movie
it hit fit like haze standards
yeah
it was not for children
and neither is this movie
yeah there's a
and I wanted to make that point real quick
because
when you see a lot of the stuff about this movie
it's like I can't believe they put this in a kids movie
this isn't a kids movie
it's a PG
which in the 80s was like you could see
nudity in a PG movie
yeah like there's
yeah like Looney Tunes were for adults
they did not expect children to know who Peter Lorre was
he's always fucking in there
and yet I did
Brian was born knowing Peter Lorre
but like
it's
all of this stuff up until this point
is like
yeah if you watch this movie as a kid
you're gonna have a sense of what's going on
but like
I watched this movie when I was a kid
yeah
it was not nearly as funny for me back then as it is now
it's
it's just
it works on a different level once you're a little older
like some of the cartoon gags are funny when you're a kid
like the opening sequence is really funny
the weasels are funny
yeah
yeah
but like that's kind of it for children
right
and then the rest of it is like
this man's divorce
it's impending
and there's been murder and intrigue
because I saw it when I was a kid
and didn't watch it again for like 20 years
and watching it again a couple years ago
I was like
I don't remember Eddie being a drunk
but like
yeah
but when I was 11
I didn't really know what a
I didn't really have a great handle on what a drunk was
he was just drinking a lot of iced tea
you know
why is this guy tired all the time
along with all of the photos from
you know the patty cake
yeah
Eddie develops a number of other photos
because remember
the camera had some stuff from that trip
yeah
and he sees not just photos of him and Dolores
but also him and another guy
who's this other guy
yeah
oh and to be frank
no role of film in this format
would have had this many pictures on it
okay Brian
also
ding
to make a flip book
yeah
that's absurd
ding ding
these are gigantic negatives
we're talking about
they were called postcard negatives
because they were the size of a postcard
I also just
bigger than IMAX film
that's crazy
yes it is
it's truly actually bigger than IMAX film
oh yeah
I love that like
the way that this sets up the mystery here too
it gives you one line
where Roger threatens Eddie
in a way like
hey nobody gonna touch my wife
in a way that it's just
it's actually scary
and it sets him up
oh maybe he did do it
in this initial thing
yeah
and like your senses go up for that
but it's done a really great job
of like introducing you to like
potential villains over the course of it
until it does
kind of hit you in the face
with who the villain is
but this is a murder mystery right
yeah
because we discover
right after this sequence
where we get a little bit more
of Eddie's backstory
where we discover that
he and his brother
were detectives together
and they grew up as clowns
the son of a clown
this is what
sort of also gives you
a little bit more of an understanding
for what Eddie's deal is
and why he has empathy for toons
yeah
being a clown
of course you're going to be
adjacent to that world
and they used to work toontown
right
yeah that was his deed
he used to do the vaudeville circuit
with Betty Boop
and it's like
it's you know
as once he does go to toontown
a lot of toons recognize him
right
because of all of his time
that he spent there
he just hasn't been back
ever since his brother's
untimely demise
right
and the way this is
this is all done without dialogue
yes
right
it's all just the pictures
he passes out
because panning around
a bunch of photos
but it's so effective
it's so efficient
economy of storytelling
I'm telling you
also his brother's desk
is right across from him
it's covered in dust
like it feels like
you're in a Disneyland ride
and actually that was my experience
with Roger Rabbit
was I just
I rode that ride
cabs
all the time
when I was a kid
it's also about the dust
when Roger
I'm jumping ahead for a second
but when Roger comes in
he puts his hand on the chair
the dust moves
unbelievable
which is like
he puts his hand down
he takes it away
it's the same shot
and the dust is gone
and there are fingerprints
on the chair
yeah
I'm just like
honestly
how dare they
they should be
in jail
so now we know
Eddie's background
and naturally
now we have to have
the call to adventure
it's the next morning
and shocker
Marvin Acme
remember him
the guy who was playing
patty cake with Jessica Rabbit
well he's dead
and it looks like
Roger Rabbit
killed him
oh my god
who framed him
who indeed
let's find out
after this Eddie
hello
worst of all possible worlds
listeners
Roger Rabbit here
you might remember me
from the Baby Herman shorts
seminal funnies
such as
Cookie Trouble
Bassinet Bonanza
and Baby Herman
Fights the Hun
Death to the Kaiser
I say
now over the years
many people have asked me
Roger
you and Jessica
seem to have it all
figured out
you've got money
you've got success
you both seem
so darn happy
how do you do it
well listeners
the secret to any great marriage
is threefold
one
always listen
before you speak
two
never leave a dirty mallet
in the sink
and
three
eat pussy
like it's your literal job
yes
I've never felt closer
to my darling wife
Jessica
than when I am
molest deep
in her giggle box
waiting for the telltale sign
of a tomb climax
assault the stream
right to the face
you've heard of begin the begin
well now you can
virgin the virgin
sniff for truffles
trim the old meat curtains
dig for carrots
in old McGregor's carrot patch
a piano to the head
ain't the only way
to make your partner
see stars
I've devoured Jessica's pussy
in all its forms
from Elmer Fudd
to Gotham
and let me tell you
it has done wonders
for a
for a
listeners
may I be frank
with you
hello
I'm frank
now that I'm done
being frank
can I be honest
things have been a bit
strained
between me
and Jessica
lately
and it's not just
the murders
or being framed
for the murders
or the
extramarital
patty
cake
the truth is
I've been a little
distant lately
I've always been terrible
about bringing my work
home with me
turning over every take
in my head
thinking what I could
have done better
beating myself up
with every emotional
and physical
mallet I got
because well
at the end of the day
I'm a C-list
toon
trying to make a name
for himself
in this A-list
town
Jessica came home
from work the other
night and found me
watching old reels
of the art of skiing
what I consider to be
Go-feet's magnum opus
and she asked me
what's wrong
and I said
look at what he can do
he flies off that jump
and through the air
like
like he's a bird
like it's a ballet
and I can't even get
stars to appear
over my head
on command
I'm a hack
a loving
a nobody
and I'm just worried
there's gonna come
a day when you
realize that
and leave me
for someone who isn't
that's when I feel
a hand on my shoulder
look at me
she says
I do
but my pupils
slowly shift
to the other side
of my head
accompanied by
a slide whistle
no bits Roger
please
my pupils return
but with a slightly
smaller slide whistle
now I want you to
listen to me
very carefully
Goofy is very good
at what he does
and he deserves
all the praise
he gets
but I don't let you
hit
because you're Goofy
I let you hit
because you're Roger
I married you
honey bunny
because you
make me laugh
she pulls me
to her ample
sloshing bosom
as she uses
my ears
to dry
my own tears
thanks Jessica
you're welcome
Roger
now
make like you did
in World War I
and get the
French in my
trench in
so grab your partner
today
and goose a
spruce poos
till all your problems
go vamoose
eating pussy
sucker and suck
that gash
so we're back
Maddie has cracked
a third can
of the Beetlejuice
soda pop
I can't stop drinking it
I do
I do worry that
by the end of this podcast
you will be dead
and we will be liable
just looking at this
one can of this thing
contains 42 grams
of added sugars
which is 84%
of your recommended
daily value
that can't be true
that's what it says
that's what it says
on the can
now that we've got
our call to adventure
we're about to meet
our primary villain
because Eddie goes
with the cops
to investigate
the crime scene
that's right
the ghost with the moose
Beetlejuice himself
I feel like
if I had to film this
I would quit
the movie industry
entirely
yeah so
this is
what I remember
the most about this movie
from having seen it
as a kid
just as we're sort of
looking around
and seeing what's
in this warehouse
Christopher Lloyd
shows up
he is playing
Judge Doom
he's got weird teeth
he's got a horrible
makeup line
but I love the fucking
it's just a safe
stuck in the floor
yeah
like in such a cartoony way
yeah
and the chalk outline
of someone's body
with a head
it's just where the safe was
yes
it's such a funny gag
to me
it's so grotesque
too
because your mind
fills in the blank
of what happened
before he got there
and killed somebody
but all of these
visual gags here
because you know
it's boxes
full of cartoon
mayhem creation
right
like things that will
cause mayhem
in various ways
because that's what
Acme does
and a lot of fake eyes
hmm
hmm
I want to talk
a little bit
about Judge Doom
because there were
two aspects of his
character that were cut
because they would
be logistical nightmares
okay
one he was supposed
to have a fake
vulture friend
oh yes
who would perch
on his shoulder
and be in every
single scene
that he's in
and two
he was supposed
to in his briefcase
have 12 kangaroos
that would spell out
you are guilty
with their joeys
in order to get
his like guilty
verdict
in order to kill people
such a good
a literal kangaroo
gag
I'm sad they had
to cut that
and 76 trombones
why
oh to lead the big parade
thought it was a joke
oh well just
I didn't know
it's good to let people
know
unfortunately we
didn't get the kangaroos
we did not get the kangaroos
but what we did get
was this fantastic
fucking performance
from Christopher Lloyd
we talked to mr. maroon
he told us the rabbit
became quite agitated
when you showed him
the pictures
the rabbit said
one way or another
he and his wife
are going to be happy
is that true
pal
do I look like a stenographer
shut your yap
Eddie
the man's in charge
that's alright lieutenant
from the smell of him
I'd say it was the booze
talking
no matter
the rabbit won't get far
my men
will find him
weasels
yes
I find I have a special gift
for the work
alright you mugs
fall out
did you find the rabbit
don't worry judge
we got the formants
all over the city
we'll find them
Christopher Lloyd
kills a shoe
there's a box
that's just full of
imprisoned sentient shoes
that was the real
probably the thing
that's stuck in my
I think this is
very common memory
of having this
horrid scene
where the shoe
voiced by
the Simpsons
own Nancy Cartwright
is murdered horribly
this shoe
is so cute
the shoe is
adorable
it's the cutest
it's not just
the cutest shoe
I've ever seen
it's one of the
cutest animations
I've seen
period
so cartoons of course
can't die
they can get hit
they can get squashed
they can go through
sissy hypno
and still come out fine
right
and
so
the judge
has made
the dip
to kill cartoons
it is a mixture
of turpentine
acetate
and benzene
funny little gag
if you've ever had to
take paint off
anything
very rarely
when you're taking
paint off of an animation
cells that smoke
like that
yeah
or scream
for its life
yeah
or look
that's not too uncommon
or look pleadingly
toward you
as it is screaming
with it for its life
and the shoe is red
so like the fluid
becomes red
as it starts to dissolve
in it
he takes his hand out
he's got a rubber glove on
and it's covered in
basically blood
and again
this is one of those
moments where it's like
oh this is not
a children's movie
again you can watch
as a kid
I did
I was scarred by this
moment
you'll remember
the shoe forever
of course
you will always
rest in peace
you beautiful shoe
the shoe doesn't even
come back at the end
this is something
that I learned
this is a rule
of Roger Rabbit
canon
is that it is
possible
to reanimate
characters
so long as you
have at least
one of the cells
so
in my own
personal
head canon
there was a cell
available of this
shoe somewhere
and it was able
to be reanimated
because you got to
think about the
shoe's brother
or like
I don't know
companion
yeah companion
you know
because this was
a right shoe
so what about
lefty out there
lefty's still in the box
like that's the thing
like most of these
shoes are just
sitting in a box
for the rest of their
lives
like veal
oh god
oh no
it's also such a
wonderful
just as tasty
you think anyone's
eaten a cartoon
in the universe
oh man
I mean have people
hunted cartoon
for sport
does anybody
well so actually
one of the things
about judge doom
was that
I'm not joking
one of the draft
there were like
60 drafts of the script
it's like back to the future
right
there were so many
permutations
but judge doom
at one point
was the guy
who killed
Bambi's mom
oh wow
he was the hunter
he was the hunter
but Disney probably
wasn't happy with that
I imagine
I actually think
it just wasn't
dramaturgically sound
enough to keep in
sure
and that's the sort
of thing that would
have made the movie
into ready player one
yeah
honestly
that's a good point
like Bambi would be a movie
in the world of Roger Rabbit
played by actors
that's right
so we should take a moment
then also to establish
what judge doom's whole deal
is as a character
right
he is keeper of the law
specifically regarding tunes
and as we saw
with this shoe
he can just
kill them
at will
he's been given
you know
the power of
life and death
by the governing authority
because again
in this world
tunes are second class citizens
who can be dispatched
at will
yeah
they're not recognized
as having the same rights
as you or I
right
yeah
and there's a wonderful
bit of foreshadowing
in that
he has to put on
a glove first
in order to use the dip
and immediately
your brain goes
but if he's human
the dip shouldn't
affect him
well he's also
already wearing gloves
and he's also
and it's so funny
oh my god
that's right
he puts a glove
on over his glove
yeah
yeah
but maybe
he has no skin exposed
except for his head
yeah
but also maybe
it's that the dip
does have other
toxic properties
you know
you wouldn't
you wouldn't want
to dunk your hand
into a thing of turpentine
that just wouldn't
be a good idea
not too frequently
no
right
but again
every once in a while
for recreation
just for fun
I tend to drink it
that's kidding
I'm kidding
I only drink
as they reach
for the Fanta
Fanta
haunted apple
I'm just gonna
drink it right
on my column
there it is
alright
I love hearing
that
cinnamon lingers
do I detect
clove
we got callbacks
folks
we should do
we got callbacks
right here in
river city
with a capital
c
and that rhymes
for p
and that stands
for I'm gonna
go fucking
kill myself
weasels are
I want to talk
a little bit
about the weasels
here for a second
because they're
originally supposed
to be seven of them
to mimic the seven dwarves
there's a lot of weasels
I think there's five
I believe there's five
weasels
five weasels
for five daughters
going down to Sodom
Sodom
Sodom
a log rolling
god damn it
you people
Stubby K
by the way
he wasn't
I don't think
he was in
Seven Brides
but he was in
the Little Abner
musical
oh
I love these
weasels
because they're
just little
stinkers
and it is
I think
really interesting
that like
Roger's whole point
on being on this
planet is to make
people laugh
and because
these tunes
these weasels
have fully turned
against their
core identity
when they laugh
they have the
they could die
from laughter
because they have
so profoundly
rejected who
they are
as people
and they're
just nightmares
to behold
some of these
weasels
I love the
zoot suit
weasel
I think the
design on the
zoot suit
weasel
is so cool
it's so cool
I love him
he's the main
weasel
I think
he's the
one who holds
the pistol
yeah
I think one
of the weasels
is named
smart ass
like it's
really
that might be
the dumb one
yeah
and there's like
psycho weasel
the pistol's one of
those great examples
of like oh the
animators just had
to deal with that
the pistol's like
waving around
the room
he's walking
around the room
he's going
I'm pointing
this at
everything
so having
now witnessed
this absolutely
horrifying
execution
yeah
Eddie has a
better understanding
of what the
stakes are
of this thing
like if Roger
Rabbit
gets found
by this guy
he's going to
suffer a
horrifying
demise
and something
that's a little
unusual here
of course
is that the
nature of the
murder was
a safe
to the head
and we'll also
remember that
Eddie's brother
died thanks to
a piano to the
head
so something
here is already
not quite adding
up
and Eddie heads
back to his
office and he
is immediately
confronted by
baby Herman
baby Herman just
doesn't believe
fundamentally that
Roger did it
in fact he
believes that
somebody else
did it because
he was framed
well one might
say who would
have done that
because here's
the thing right
Marvin Acme had
a will
in that will
the rumor
has it
that the
entirety of
Toontown
is to be
willed to
its inhabitants
on Acme's
death
the Toons say
he promised
they do
they said
and they love
and believe him
it's sort of
like how the
Staten Islanders
believe that like
they were granted
a lifetime
pass to never
have to pay
tolls on the
Verrazano Bridge
which isn't
true
it's like how
John F. Kennedy
said that I'm
going to fake
my death and
then come back
and then all of
you are going
to get med beds
that cure all
diseases
it's a lot
like that
yeah
it's going to
happen
like in like
three months
yeah
yeah
yeah
that's pretty
soon
yeah
it's pretty
soon
he's just
waiting for
Donald Trump
to get reelected
so if you're
listening with
an illness
that's killing
you hang on
we're almost
there
stay in line
when Marvin
Acme died
his will
was in his
pocket
right
but that
that will
now
nowhere to
be found
it wasn't
in the crime
scene
so what's
going on
yeah
without a
will
there's no
way
it's also
that I
think this
scene is very
funny because
obviously
Eddie Valiant
has to like
take a big
big swig of
booze when he
gets back into
the room but
then it is the
empty glass that
allows him to
see that the
will was in
his pocket
which means
alcohol actually
does solve a lot
of this movie's
problems
but here's the
thing not only
has Eddie heard
this little bit
from baby Herman
it turns out
that there's
somebody in
his apartment
and it's
fucking Roger
Rabbit himself
yeah
oh no
he's underneath
he's in his
bed actually
he lies down
in his little
Murphy bed
rolls over
and there's
Roger
hello
and immediately
things go to
shit right
it's like get
out of here
so I didn't
clip a whole lot
of Roger
but I did
want to clip
at least a
little so you
can really
hear this
performance
they end up
going back
to the bar
that's owned
by Dolores
so that they
can hide out
and right here
Eddie is trying
to basically
hacksaw away
a handcuff
that is linking
him to Roger
hold still
will ya
does this help
yeah
thanks
do you mean
tell me
you could have
taken your
hand out
of that
cuff
at any
time
no not
at any
time
only when
it was
funny
come on
Eddie
raise your
sense of
humor
he always
is funny
or only on
days when
he's wanted
for murder
listen my
philosophy is
this if you
don't have
a good sense
of humor
you're better
off dead
so this is
the other
thing that I
really like
about sort
of the way
they build
the world
here
Roger also
has his own
very clear
set of
motivations
he just
wants to
make people
laugh
and in fact
it's such a
strong will
that if
anything happens
that might
prompt it
from him
even if he
doesn't want
to he still
has to make
people laugh
it's a compulsion
yes
listening to that
clip also
it was very
interesting to me
because I think
the sound design
of this movie
is so good
yeah
I wasn't thinking
about so much
because it's so
rich visually
but listening to
it there like
incredible cartoon
foley work
on the saw
and like somebody
whips something
around you hear
like a whipping
noise
like all those
cartoon noises
are in there
just like in the
world
it's so good
and the dialogue
you'll see that
there's a lot of
ADR in this movie
there's a lot of
dialogue replacement
partly because
they had to have
the live actors
on set
or the voice actors
live on set
right so Fleischer
playing Roger Rabbit
you know he
would do the
he was sort of
act as Roger
Standen
he'd walk around
in the costume
and then they'd
do another
rehearsal where
they just had a
life-size Roger
Rabbit dummy
so they knew
where their
eyeline would
be
then they had
to take him
out put in
the little
animatronics or
marionettes or
whatever for that
shot and then
Fleischer would just
be over in the
corner in a booth
yeah reading his
lines off
it's a very
complicated process
for all the
actors involved
including the
cartoon voice
actors everybody
has to be 100%
all day long
every day
it's wild that
all that was
going on and
everybody gave
such good
performances
right like it's
so easy to get
Ewan McGregor in
the second Star Wars
prequel where he's
like in the big
ball of ten at least
in the big pit of
tennis balls
the whole movie
he's just like in
like a CGI void
yeah and he's just
like not looking at
anybody like there's
like nothing for him
to react off of
but like there's
just like so much
going on here and
the days were
probably so tortured
oh my god well
Hoskins was shooting
for 16 hour days
for most of the
issues
turning in that
it's crazy
unbelievable
this scene was him
you know he had
Roger stuffed in the
coat and they had
all these springs and
things hooked up to
him he had wires
running down his
pants so he was
wired into this
whole thing
couldn't go to the
bathroom it was all
poking him it was
not fun like right
that's the thing I
noted with everyone
who worked on it was
like they're all very
proud of it and they
never want to do
another one of these
fucking things again
I had that same
thought of like
nobody everybody is
100% committed
yeah but this is not
a movie where you're
like wow everybody's
having such a good
time no this is
no yeah to pull off
maybe Christopher
Lloyd
but to pull off
something this
technical requires a
razor sharp amount of
precision like because
it's it's layer on
layer on layer on
layer and you can't
just be goofing
around this isn't
fucking blues
brothers you know
the thing that you do
with special effects
shots at this time
now we have a lot of
digital tracking and
things like that but
like if you're doing
everything is optical
you're not really
running things through
the computer and even
if you're running just
certain steps through the
computer you basically
if you're doing a
moving shot you have
to have a bunch of
little robot arms that
record the movement so
let's say you're moving
the camera across and
then you have this
element over here that's
going to get replaced
by a special effect and
that has to move up as
you're going across you
do this shot once with
the actors and then you
record all of that
movement right and so
here they have the added
animatronics for anything
holding a glass or a
tray or whatever then
you go back as an
actor you have to hit
your marks at the same
time because that
camera is going to move
at the exact same speed
hit the exact same
points as it did last
take right this is so
technical it's it's
really funny too because
they even sneak in like
so many cool like the
animators are able to
sneak in like little bits
here or there too in
this scene where it keeps
cutting back it's a it's a
two-shot of it cuts back
between Eddie and Roger
and Dolores in the other
corner and just keeps
cutting back and forth
back and forth and every
time it cuts back Roger
is in a weirder position
and it's so funny and
again they didn't they
could have just done this
I feel like most modern
animation or most modern
things that would do this
it would be in the same
position every single
time but like that also
could be I mean like what
I know of animators yeah
it is almost never
animators not wanting to do
something or not being able
to almost every animator
working today could do
this stuff yeah they just
aren't allowed to they're
not given the budget to do
so yeah that's Roger and
keep being in the same
position because it's extra
money it's extra time like
the the producers won't
allow it the network the
whatever the the studio
won't allow it like yeah
so much so much the way
that you get quality
animation is pump money
into it there's already so
many people who are so
good at it and so
passionate about it that
are sitting around wanting
to do this stuff and
they're not allowed to
and it's such an
interesting contrast to
me too like talking
about the highly
technical physical side
of the production which
was very it had to be
restricted so that the
animators had the freedom
to play around I think
that's really interesting
it is a small movie in
that the amount number
of locations we go to is
actually pretty limited
right it's maybe like
a handful of sets like a
handful of locations yeah
and here and there it's
just that what they're able
to do inside of those
locations is so
extraordinary I think
because they've limited
the scope of it well and
one of the really
extraordinary things
they're able to do is in
the very next scene where
Eddie goes back to his
home and Jessica Rabbit is
there waiting for him you've
got to have the rabbit to
make the scam work no no no I
love my husband you've got me
all wrong you don't know how
hard it is being a woman
looking the way I do
perfect my notions my
notions the way that they
get her to physically
interact with him like
there's the part yeah where
she takes his hat and slams it
into his chest or she grabs
his necktie and pulls on it
all the way to the end I mean
just the the when she again
I'm just I'm mad at that I
know right there they
holding up when she holds up
the mirror and like goes from
her face to seeing his face in
the mirror fuck off how did
they do that they turned a
mirror very slowly with a
string like I it's crazy
that scene with Roger where
they're hacksawing the the
handcuffs Eddie walks in it's a
dark room and he hits his head
on the light and then turns the
light on and the light is
swinging and then he hits his
head on the light again and
hits his head on the light
again so they have to go to
multiple different shots the
editor has to fucking clean
that up right where the swing
matches up every time yeah
and then of course the
animators who are doing the
highlights and shadows on
every cell yeah have to make
that work with each swing of
the light until it is finally
held and stopped it is
unbelievable and then to tease
that out even further cutting
physical film I mean it goes
without saying now obviously
because we're cool printing
multiple layers Robert Zemeckis
is five feet away from you
jerking off
to his own movie
well you can see
get rid of my notions
you can see why he gets so
confident in do it like that's
why back to the future too it's
all split-screen shit
he's like I can do this yeah of
course I could just do like
parent trap shit after this
well it's I mean it's all just
about the little details too I
mean the splashing of water like
yeah the weasels kind of do on
their way out you know which is
just at the tail end of a very
complicated scene they added
that little tiny little wrinkle
the shadow work on every single
one of Roger's movements where
if he moves in the ear the
shadow also moves yeah this is
where it was really smart because
the shadows were their own team
of people oh okay so like that's
a layer that you're doing as a
mat over the animation so that
involved another another role of
film unbelievable another element
in the optical it was like too
almost too many things in the
optical printer and and so they
were having to come up with new
technology they also had to figure
out how to make something that
was superimposed change focus
right they do a shot where Jessica
rabbit looks up at a window in the
background and it racks the focus
away from her to the building so
they have to make her blurry right
there's such weird sound design in
that Jessica rabbit scene too because
Bob Hoskins pants drop and then
Dolores walks in and he stands up
really quickly and hit and hits Jessica
rabbit's boobs right oh yeah but
there's but there's they sound wet
like there's something in them and I
don't and it was so unnerving that is
what they sound like that is all yeah
I'm just gonna say that for you just
as someone of boob experience yeah
they're very wet especially when
they're that big that's why they're
that's why they're so wet is the
bigger they are the wetter they're
they're fuller yeah you guys have a
saying the bigger they are the wetter
they are yeah I'm always saying this
yeah god I wish I and I also just
want to point out here but there is
something that's like there's
something that's actually genuinely
very sweet about Jessica and Roger's
relationship which is why I think it
works in the movie when when Roger is
depressed after he thinks that
Jessica's you know he has seen that
Jessica's played patty cake behind his
back he has a triptych of photos with
her where they're all just on like
vacationer things and he's not really
he never ogles her it's every single
shot where they're like hugging he has
his ears wrapped around her head and
it's just so cute let's hear it hit
because he's goofy I mean it is she
has mine where she says you know I'm
with him because he makes me laugh yeah
and it's so it's genuine and sincere
from here we get some plot you know it's
opportunities all the machinery all the
double crosses every noir is like and
the second act is always like I just
yeah I kind of like always lose track
so just it's honestly better if you
don't know what's what yeah exactly
you walked out of it you're like there
was a bunch of stuff that went down at
that point oh yeah so we get another
fun scene with Christopher Lloyd we get
a really great car chase scene yeah that
car
have you seen the behind the scenes of
that car that is a fucking real like
go-kart and where the trunk of that
car is is where they have the driver
like below Bob Hoskins driving this
thing
fantastic so they're getting into
actually like hazardous situations
my god he's red flintstone he's just
moving his feet right really fast yeah
since the divorce he had to find
different work yeah that's why it
feels so good and so real I mean I
mentioned actually moving around yes
yeah I mentioned they could actually
die at any moment I mentioned blues
brothers earlier that's another really
great example of like the reason that
those car chase sequences feel so good
is that they are real cars they
smashed like 50 cars making that movie
you know and it's the same thing here
turns out the John Landis way of
directing makes good movies don't do
this don't do this and nobody dies
bad metaphor yeah bad metaphor oh god
I mean he's not as good as Max Landis
but oh my god we also get my close
personal friends don't let him sleep on
your couch we also get a really fun
character grounding scene here we we
you can do it again are you done
children I was just pointing at the
couch so so so I was silent so I'm
good Riley I will say this is that that
trash future episode that you went on
where like Riley threw out the outline
halfway through one of my favorite
episodes like of I should be any
podcast I should not be invited
anywhere it's really good I only know
how to do one thing okay so we also get
a really fun scene where Roger and
Eddie are at a theater together you know
yeah this is this is also another really
nice moment of character for Roger
because they're watching a goofy
animated cartoon like goofy the best to
ever do it I love this scene so much
maybe so happy to be like of course
he's got a tremendous amount of
respect yeah whatever goofy's real name
is I always forget isn't it just goofy
no he's got a real he's got a real name
talk about something else I'm gonna find
it sure well no it's it's it's so
beautiful this scene because it's like
Roger as sort of the archetypal ideal I
think of what a movie star should be
yeah just in love with the craft and in
love with those who make it with his
real name is George G Gief that's so
funny I cannot believe I cannot believe
it stand for goof is it George goof
please maybe maybe like that's implied I
like apparently the goof troop gave him
the continuity of goof troop gave him the
name Gigi goofy goof it was actually he
he did a very similar act to Gigi Allen
that's right
Garsh
Maddie what is it about this scene between
Eddie and Roger that grabs you so much
it honestly it was it was it was less
Eddie and Roger and that it was Roger
watching like a modern master at work yeah
and the way that like in the way the
animators talk about like the craft of
this thing it's the same kind of like oh I
just love when people take this shit
seriously yeah yeah it deserves and
requires care yeah and to like watch of
course you're watching goof if you're an
animated character and you're watching
goofy you're like this guy's the best
ever fucking doing it it's very meta in
a way isn't it it's it's it's not an
annoying way it's like of course it's not
just dropping the references and being
like yeah remember that it feels like it
feels like when you see comedians in the
back of a comedy club talking to each
other exactly like yeah also gives you a
sense that maybe Roger's a little
second-rate like this studio is not on
the same level as as Disney and Warner
Brothers like all artists he's doing it
because he himself has tremendous taste
regardless of his own skill level yeah
and there's something too about the
lighting in this space where Roger is a
little dark for a lot of the movie
especially in the 4k restoration but in
the theater they are of equal lighting and
this was the scene where I was like Roger
Rabbit is real he is my friend and he's
in this theater right now because Bob
Hoskins gives this Shakespearean
performance about remembering his
brother's death yes yeah where Roger is
just like I completely understand why you
would hate me after that and it's just
like how could you hate Roger for how
tired his voice is and how like it's so
like up here like you're just like you
you love this guy and you want to protect
him at all costs and that's where the
turn happens and Eddie gives that whole
monologue with a very slow crane push in
that whole time and they have to fucking
animate Roger right slowly think about
that getting bigger and getting out of
frame yeah how how dare they also like
doing this traditional animation is just
so yeah astounding to me I keep saying
astounding and crazy and wacky but it is
so just astonishing you want to have words
at some point don't you like yeah like
making it get bigger you know like I
don't you have to draw it quite
smoothly to it's just I didn't have
green screens they didn't have red X's
to go off of I know I think it's just
fucking Williams just being like oh yeah
I think about trying to do this yeah
my brain is like shorting out I'm like
I don't even like drawing cars like
many have you have you done much in the
way of animation I the the nib the
RIP right we had a brief was two
seasons of animated shows that we did
with Augenblick Studios when back when
you're owned by First Look Media and I
was a producer on that show and I wrote
a bunch of segments and then we used to
animate I would draw keyframes and the
animators at Augenblick would animate it
and I would go occasionally go to the
studio and like observe them doing it and
but I was like a producer on the show and
I sat in all the voice stuff which is
very fun and cool to do like I just got
a new appreciation for animation works
and I got my hands around a little
better and I've done here and around
that time I was like I was a full-time
employee of a media company and they
gave me some I like had the time to
like play around some stuff and I was
doing some like gif animations back
because it was 2017 we all to do it was
the style of time it was the time pivot
to gif pivot to gifs I mean kind of but
I did some comics I'd like motion in
them and stuff and I got like I know how
to do it very amateurishly much like
Roger Rabbit watching goofy I'm watching
this movie like I can never even fathom
being this good at it and you know as
somebody who I think particularly in
Boy's Weekend like really has just an
impeccable sense of like world building
and and detail work I think some like the
signs in the background are just I think
that's that's I feel like that's a
Simpsons influence there that's that's
that was Simpsons I was thinking a lot
about Futurama actually oh cool yeah
there's a lot of background gags which
is obviously like baked into my brain but
like Futurama does like background
world building they love the signage the
weird little things that you notice yeah
right and like oh you know like all
visual media that takes place in like a
built environment that's like not real
like it's not secondary world or
anything but like something that is
completely made up like the world of
Boy's Weekend yeah obviously you're
going to do world building in the
background that's just how it works but
like to me it was just sort of like
this is an opportunity for jokes yeah
yeah oh sure and that was also a thing
to keep me sort of from going crazy
because comics is really tedious
because you write it or you I pitched it
then I outlined it and then I wrote a
script and I penciled it then I inked it
then I colored it right right and it's
just somewhere you're just like okay I
need to get finished with this I've read
it so many times by the time I'm like
when I'm inking it I'm like well I'm
gonna throw something back right here
to some like to keep this visually
interesting for me sure oh sure sure
and I have to imagine that the
process of animating Roger Rabbit had
some of that same shit going on where
they were just having to stare at these
cells forever and be like I mean yeah
usually when you're animating right you
have like your your sheets of paper in
the early stages where you're penciling
in and everything and it's just kind of
going off of that you'll have your
storyboards you'll have maybe some
kind of rudimentary background shape or
maybe maybe but here they had to print
every frame of film right from the
movie enlarge it make it into a
background that they had to draw each
initial sketch on you can't even yeah I
just doing this movie without like
Photoshop seems insane yeah it's over it's
also over 90 minutes and that's the thing
it's a long movie I mean it doesn't feel
it never once feels it but are there
are there how many scenes are there
where there's not a cartoon in it very
few very very few yeah probably right up
top there's the bar and Zemeckis the way
that he understands blocking is just yeah
I talked about how like that first shot
was kind of Spielberg blocking but like
Zemeckis knows how to stage people yeah
how to position them how to move the
camera and that like he even does a
little burlesque on it at the end of
back to the future 2 we're like doc says
a line and he walks right up in the
foreground and then he comes back and
then Marty walks to the same spot and
doesn't know why he did it yeah I really
do this this era of Zemeckis I really
actually do love how stagey everything
is yes it feels a little artificial but
like in a way that's like fascinating
you'll have cool like with signs signs
being this major part of storytelling
cloverleaf how you see cloverleaf how
you see symbols for the trolleys and
everything there's a part where valiant
and the bartender they walk halfway
across the street simply so that you
can see that cloverleaf billboard behind
them while they're talking to each other
actually happens in this very next scene
here after Roger and Eddie leave the
theater where we see yes right up in
front of the bar because the bar is also
the trolley depot right learn that
cloverleaf the big evil corporation you
know they're the fucking Weyland Yutani
this movie right all right crew disposable
bring back the rabbit they have acquired
the trolley depot they've also acquired
maroon studios yes whoa wouldn't you know
it that is the piece that makes Eddie
realize the connection between all of
these things cloverleaf that's the big
connect it's a real estate scheme my god
to build freeways and we'll get to that
a little bit later but basically Eddie
goes right off to the studio right this
is going to be what unlocks everything
but just when he's about to learn the
truth mr maroon is assassinated before
his very eyes and it seems perhaps that
Jessica rabbit was the one who pulled
the trigger and the most murder on the
orient express looking gun yeah out of a
so it could not be longer so good it's an
incredibly visceral scene but he gives
chase to Jessica rabbit yes because
Jessica's also taken Roger yeah with
her by conking him out knock him over
the head with a frying pan and would you
know they've driven off to toontown and
so that is where we will go together
forget it Josh it's toontown that's
right this is where the cartoon pistol
comes into play that we were talking
about yeah with all the bullets who are
really lovely until they get racist yeah
well so the bullets are okay no this is
where we go into voice actor territory
because the first voice you hear is Jim
Cummings doing an Andy Devine impersonation
oh a million fucking Westerns and he's
Friar Tuck right so it's the impression of
the guy who played Friar Tuck but doing
an impression of the cowboy characters he
played sexy and then also like Friar
fuck more like Friar fuck also is you get
Pat Buttram who was the sheriff of
Nottingham in Robin Hood he's also mr.
Haney and Green Acres did a lot of you
know he's the guy you know well now mr.
Douglas and I always love to hear that
guys it's such a delight it's like oh he
was still alive thank God they got him
and then Jim Gallant as a third bullet
and then there's the racist bullet yeah
one racist gag I'm calling the gag in
considering that it's 1988 yeah pretty
amazing that this is the only racist gag
in the movie congratulations who frame
Roger Rabbit yeah yeah but you were only
racist for about 30 to 45 seconds yeah
no it's like the classic like Native
American yeah it does a war word dress
he's got the tomahawk yeah Robert come
on the show I'll interview you for a
Monday interview and I will grill you
about the racist bullet for 40 minutes he
famously does not talk about past
projects like he is very much against
famously will not apologize he will not
apologize so he just has to talk about
his mom shitty looking movie coming up
with Tom Hanks where everything is one
shot yeah and everything is AI yeah
everything is one shot it's it's one
shot that doesn't move there are oh oh
that's the one based on that comic
there are assets in the background that
are there are generated
yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean that's my
understanding
well that's the thing like and I know
you're listening to the show Robert
that's right I'm a huge fan and I think
I think Blank Check talked about this a
lot but it's this idea that Zemeckis
really loves playing with his toys yeah
he needs a new hot new thing he does
that hot new thing and so Beowulf juice
yeah well that's why Beowulf is like
even though it's not good it's
fascinating I think it's interesting yeah
yeah yeah and there are things about it
that could be good and then it's like
well yeah Roger Avery wrote half of this
so of course not but it's got a golden
butts in it and nobody nobody says
what the first line of Beowulf he what
great so so we head into Toontown that is
one of our normal jobs Maddie
somebody hasn't been listening to
Wits Endless Summer and I don't blame
you so so so we enter into Toontown yeah
which has this remarkable opening which I
think they just set up anytime anyone
comes into Toontown the curtain parts and
we're in this like nightmare tree world
where all these ants are screaming at Bob
Hoskins welcoming to singing yes are those
ants from anything I think they are I
think they are because they had such a
weird specific design where they had
like knees going into the ground yeah
like cuff head riffs on that yeah that
feels like a fly shirt they seem very
flight opening feels fly sure right
because fly sure you have a lot of like
kids go to sleep and then they go to a
candy lander you know someone is getting
introduced to a place that one episode
of over the garden wall yes yes
strip technicolor yeah oh oh oh I
doctor X if you want to hear more about
over the garden wall listen to our
episode about last year well the rest of
this episode the thing is I think yeah
just about all of these cartoon
characters are existing cartoon
characters from other things but they're
not things that you would necessarily go
oh that's the that's that train from
master chief
even to the point of recognizable
characters the fact that Bob Hoskins
got the gun from Yosemite Sam is a fun
little bit of world building that doesn't
call too much attention to it so no right
the cameo use in this movie and we're
gonna get into like the big cameo like
we had Donald and Daffy earlier right now
we're getting into like the Mickey and
Bugs like Tweety and like the big heavy
hitters dog shows up as an elevator
operator
and then yes we do get a moment where we
have the classic cartoon thing Bob
Hoskins steps out over a ledge yeah and
does the delayed fall yeah and grabs his
hat yeah and he just has to duck down
and then reach his hands up and grab it
and he times it perfectly yep oh and
then we get this
what's up doc
it's them
yeah
yeah
you could get killed
that's an insane line for Mickey Mouse to say
I'm so sorry
yeah but I don't think you want it
I do I do give it to me
gee I'll better let him have it bud
okay doc whatever you say
here's the spare
thank you
and it's a spare tire
um
yeah
ain't I a stinker
I
another another thing there speaking of
like old designs of characters and
and the sort of fascinating time and
culture the where this movie was
allowed to get made and exist
Mickey Mouse being a little shithead
yeah
yeah
being a little prankster
is the way that he used to be
yeah
he was a little piece of shit
yes
monster man
like Bugs Bunny
very similar to Bugs
and then he became the corporate mascot
and they stopped making Mickey cartoons
for such a long time
yeah
but they let him be
he says
you could die
you could die
has Mickey Mouse ever said the word die before
like
German
only to me
in Steamboat Willie
uh
like he fucking
pulls on the udders of a pig
to make him squeal
yeah
like
yeah
he's a little prankster
yeah
okay
yeah
those were the pig's notions actually
oh yeah
I don't think we call them udders when it's a pig
I think they're just nipples
they're just nipples
it looked like an udder
the way it was rendered
well you know
they're engorged
it's not actually a pig
it's a drawing of a pig
you know the pictures that weren't actually even moving
what
it's
it's
it's dozens of pictures
wait who drew it
was it
was it
was it
a man known as
Ub Iwerks
it was Ub Iwerks
oh my god
yeah
yeah but yeah
Mickey Mouse was at the core of a whole moral panic
they thought that Mickey Mouse was like turning kids into juvenile delinquents
yeah
which is just
it doesn't seem real
to say that
they're going around
attaching otters to pigs and the Yankees
you get away from Wilbur Jimmy
so the thing about this Toontown sequence is you really just need to see it for yourself
to fully appreciate it
it's
it's so beautiful
it's so gorgeous
I mean
it doesn't overstay its welcome
it's fast
also like everything's animated
the buildings are like bouncing around
like it's so
when Bob Hoskins falls
the buildings like
watch him fall
great
yeah
it's so good
because it's also so clear
that like whoever
the you know
Williams is like such like a student
of the thing
yeah
of like the art
and the craft of it
where it's like
it is
it is all very old fashioned animation
yes
because it's like
well when would have been
when would have Toontown been built
it's like at the outset of animation
right
so everything's being right
Fleischer in bouncy
everyone's singing
yes
like it's
it's so
it's so well considered
and so well rendered
that it's just
I don't know
I love it
I got nothing to add
well it's also
it's also just like
it's also kind of run down too
in a way that Toontown
it is
it is a ghetto
it has not been well maintained
and so
when you know
he's out on the street
and he's being chased by
not Jessica Rabbit
right
who
Sadie Hawkins basically
yeah
that's another Lil Abner reference
for everyone
that's where it's right
that's where Sadie Hawkins dances comes from
oh really
that character
yes
there's nothing better
do you like my sweater
so
I wouldn't have pegged you
for somebody who knew Reliant K
no that
it had crossover appeal
that was
that was mainstream
yeah
were you exposed to any Reliant K
I don't know
they are
I know about Reliant K
they were a Christian band
yeah
yeah that's why I didn't listen
yeah
that's why we did
you're smart enough
I think
a thing that I
growing up
as like a punk
yeah
who went to a lot of punk shows
and played in a lot of punk bands
I developed an incredible nose
for sniffing out Christian music
yes
hell yeah
like I could tell
when you like played me a new ska band
I was like no no
that's Christian ska right there
that's Christian ska
that's Five Iron Frenzy
that's Five Iron Frenzy
I hear Jesus on the tambourine
this is just for you Rosie
that's right
we finally bridged the gap
this is great
but like
we go into the back alleys
of Toontown here
right
and it is seedy
it's a little gross
and he falls out of the building
because there's no
the bathroom has been
torn out of the building
yes
there's a little thing
on the wall
that says for a good time
call Alice in Wonderland
and I went
what is happening
in this movie
which I think is also
a name of
one of the animators
who didn't get
proper credit
her name was not
Alice in Wonderland
but it was Alice
it was Alice in Wonderland
but you know
wouldn't you know it
Judge Doom is also
skulking around
these alleyways
because he's
trying to eliminate
Eddie
yeah
well and he's also
maybe a little familiar
with Toontown
maybe for more reasons
than just crime busting
but this all
he's doing some other
kind of busting
ultimately this all
cleans itself up
it's going to feel good
yeah
ultimately
we do
the script was written
in Judge Doom's
column I think
what were you saying
you were talking about
something else
there it goes
I was just trying
to move the show
a lot
this is a show
he calls it
his dip
oh no
but we do make
our way out of
Toontown
Jessica Rabbit
saves Eddie's hide
we go back
to the warehouse
because Eddie
has realized
that in fact
yes Judge Doom
is the bad guy
who's been doing
all of this
and he needs
to be defeated
for once and for all
but turns out
they're all waiting
for him
and Roger
and Jessica
and they're going
to do their best
to kill all
yeah so we have
the usual
you know
tie someone
to a table saw
kind of a thing
where he has
this big machine
that's going to
destroy the wall
leading into Toontown
and it's going to
demolish all of Toontown
with the dip
because it also
has a big water gun
on top
a big dip sprayer
but why would he
want to do such a thing
well it turns out
that much like
Robert Moses
Judge Doom
has a plan
for what's going
to happen
to Los Angeles
involves a lot
of arterials
eight lanes of shimmering
cement running
from here to Pasadena
smooth, safe, fast
traffic jams
will be a thing
of the past
so that's why
you killed
that new maroon
for his freeway
I don't get it
of course not
you lack vision
I see a place
where people get
on and off
the freeway
on and off
off and on
all day
all night
he's walking
up stage here
he's having such a good time
oh my god
automobile dealerships
and wonderful
wonderful billboards
reaching as far
as the eye
can see
my god
it'll be beautiful
what a monologue
unbelievable
he is the only person
having a good time
in this movie
he's having a blast
he really sets an example
for actors
like just fall in love
with every word
you say
absolutely
really tear pieces
of scenery off
and start chewing
in the room
turns out
that this
this horrible guy
this horrible judge doom
well he's not so much
of a person
as he is
a toon
oh
it's interesting
that they don't
actually reveal
his body
right
the one thing
that's important
is that
you know
Hoskins saw his brother
killed by a toon
with red eyes
and so we see
that his eyes are red
and we hear
that the voice
is squeaky
you can maybe assume
yeah you can maybe
assume he's like
a weasel
but it also kind of
seems to establish
that he's not a weasel
I want to know
who drew this evil cartoon
that kills people
yeah
glowing red
like
who in the 40s
was like
here's the cartoon
I got
you know that
that was a big mistake
they shouldn't have done that
yeah
I think
I think maybe
it was part of
Disney's propaganda
like World War 2
propaganda
like this was like
it was the hun
it was
yeah
I mean
it was
I kind of feel like
maybe this was like
just cartoon Hitler
yeah I think maybe
it was actually
cartoon Hitler
maybe it was one of
Hitler's cartoons
maybe it was from
the Ufa archive
Ufa Magoof
it could have been the
Night on Bald Mountain
guy maybe
oh yeah
he's a little spooky guy
from the 40s
Chernabog
Chernabog
the black god himself
yeah
I actually think
the scariest part about it
that his voice is like
really high pitched
after all that
I'm more of a
Bielabog girl
but
who isn't
there's a big like
horrible scream
that Jessica Rabbit
does in this scene
yeah
that is blood
curling
her eyes change
her pupils change
style
god damn
god damn
and it's so funny
because Jessica Rabbit
has been cool
as a cucumber
right yeah
this whole movie
to see her freak out
like that
you're like
oh we are in danger
yeah
what follows is
just some
truly wonderful
slapstick from Bob Hoskins
yes
oh my god
in order to
because he figures out
that the way to stop
the weasels
is to get them
to laugh
right
and so he has to become
kind of cartoonish himself
because if they laugh
hard enough
they will die laughing
and this is
this is also
a deeply terrifying
thing for me
but their souls
leave their bodies
and one of the weasels
doesn't want it to happen
and he's like
pulling his angel
back in
and I'm just like
oh no no no
that is
that is a nightmare
of death for me
crucially
he's improvising a song
to the merry-go-round
broke down
which you might know
as the Looney Tunes theme
which Roger sang earlier
to smash plates on his head
yes
right
right
and except he's not quite
like he's still a little bit
rusty
he's not a tune
and so Roger has to like
provide rhymes
and then Jessica starts
providing rhymes
in a really fun way
because you don't get to see her
be like a tune very much
right
and it's nice that she gets to
be on the bottom
and he has to juggle these weights
and throw them really high in the air
and have them all land on his head
it's all very skillful
very
you could tell that like
he learned that doing clown parts
in Shakespeare
like this was like
this will get the punchline
through you
all the actors
I should say
all the main actors
who had to deal with cartoon stuff
they all got mime training
for this movie
oh amazing
yeah
so like this wasn't just like
trusting people to come in
with the right amount of training
they were like
no no no
we're gonna have like
this whole eyeline thing
this whole making sure
you're talking to someone
that's a foot away from you
but not actually there at all
like we need to
beat that into people
before we start shooting
cock is what you're saying
oh come on
I will say
I don't think
that I can praise
the direction of this scene
highly enough
yeah
it is unbelievable
there's so much going on
what they were able to pull off
and it's also clear
like the stakes are always there
you know exactly when it's gonna happen
and that's classic Zemeckis
he always knows how to fucking build up
end up back to the future
all three of them
it's always like
okay let's get crazy
he's so good at establishing
like the geometry of a space
yes
and like the stakes of a scene
and like where you are
in space and time
and what is
setting things
like literally
there's a scene earlier
in the movie
where it's just cops
wandering around the warehouse
being like
I wonder if this will pay off later
yes
it's sort of seeding that
in your mind
and ultimately
this room is just
a big rectangle
yeah
but you know
exactly how it's shaped
you know where the things are
you know there's a boxing glove
that shoots
because someone is using it
you know where the big
like cannon that kills you
instantly is
and how it is utilized
and how
like what Bob Hoskins
needs to do
to turn it off
we get to see
Judge Doom melt
into the floor
and it's so cool
like the dip
being like the main
antagonistic force
in this scene
like the main weapon
it does basically
the same thing
it always just goes
a little bit closer
to Jessica
and Roger
and then it goes back away
and it comes closer
but somehow
the tension is ramped up
every single time
until Judge Doom
gets fully melted
fully gooped
and actually
the remains
of his rubber carcass
at the end
are the most disturbing
thing to me
in this whole sequence
the other thing
that stuck with me
from when I watched
this as a child
was after
the reveal of him
being attuned
is after he gets
run over by the steamroller
he dies
and he blows himself
back up
horrifying
but he stands up
and he's all like
he's the slender man
and he's like
stop motion
and his hands
are like curved up
and he's like
and then
he's got the
Robin Hood fingers
and then when he
turns around
and you see
his real eyes
for the first time
which are animated
and then you realize
real lies
yeah
oh my god
you're welcome
like that
same for me
I remember feeling
stop animation
with that whole sequence
gave me
the fear
capital T
capital F
yeah
yeah
but also
great shit
you know
he gets melted
and then
all the cartoons
Mickey and everyone
they gather around him
and they're like
oh I wonder who he was
that's right
we've got
we've got the clip
I wonder who he really was
I'll tell you one thing doc
he weren't no rabbit
or a duck
or a dog
or a little boy
or a sheep
or a wolf
or a puppy
there's something about this moment
along of course
with the fact that
a big fucking cartoon train
comes by
and smashes
the machine that kills you instantly
yeah
yeah
this is now
a metaphorical
and physical
representation
of the walls coming down
because then
we find the will
and it turns out
we've had it all along
we've had it all along
it was in the disappearing ink
everything has a payoff
Roger used it
to write a love letter
to Jessica
and there we go
a very bad love letter
to Jessica
and lipstick
but we get our happy ending
and it's great
yeah
I
this is one of
Mel Blanc's last performances
before he died
there is a very wonderful story
about how
well it doesn't begin wonderfully
but Mel Blanc gets into a car accident
a very bad one
hilarious
it was
great story
to be fair
his car
his car hit a banana peel
right before
but he was in a coma
for a while
and his son tells the story
about how
nobody could get through to him
they would go and talk to him
every single day
and then just like
in his like deep grief
his son was just like
bugs
and Mel Blanc goes
what's up doc
oh
yeah
and then it's like
and then the doctor comes in
he's like
just try a different character
just try a different character
he's like
Tweety
and he's like
oh I thought I saw a pudding cat
and so he was able to like
actually communicate
with his dad that way
and then at the end
of Mel Blanc's life
not long after this movie
comes out
he went back into a coma
and he said he knew
his dad was gone
when he sat next to him
and said bugs
and no one responded
because once bugs left him
so did Mel
that's
yeah
it's so wild
to think about
his doing that stuff
so long
that his brain
had become like
quite literally
maybe partitioned
a little bit
yeah
and that's what made him
so good at those voices
because you think about it
because he fully embodied them
and of course
it wouldn't be a good
cartoon movie
without Porky Pig
closing us out
and saying that's all folks
yeah
that was just
delightful
but don't forget
Tinkerbell has to fly across
yeah
that too
you get both
it is a Disney movie
you little slut
don't forget
what moment
we grabbed your pig
by the udders
and he said
that's all folks
and they sing
Smile Darn Ya Smile
which was featured
in a Warner Brothers
so in the early
Warner Brothers days
when they were still
doing black and white
cartoons
they had a character
that was a fox
I forget its name
but it was just
Mickey Mouse
and they got sued
and they're like
okay we can't do
the fox anymore
we'll do Bugs Bunny
fuck it
but like in
one of those
fox cartoons
they sing
Smile Darn Ya Smile
so it's an actual
old song
it's not just
like a pastiche
Smile Darn Ya Smile
this movie does
incredibly well
they very quickly
get a theme park
ride built for it
an entire area
of Disneyland
is called Toontown
yeah
but it's not
Roger
no no
it's Mickey Mouse's
and that was
the plan
especially because
they had opened
MGM Studios
down in Florida
which had nothing
much unlike today
where it's called
Hollywood Studios
and it still has
nothing
when you're there
what will happen
is they'll have
a stormtrooper parade
yeah
through it
you know the fascists
from the movie
that's very explicit
about how like
they are fascists
and everybody
cheers for them
yeah it's silly
because they do
the little dance
yeah
two three kick turn
turn turn kick turn
one two three
kick turn
watch me
faggots
that's what I call
a French mistake
so they were
gonna build
a whole Roger
Rabbit part
of the party
I mean this
was a fucking
major deal
they were
they made
three shorts
that premiered
before some
of their other
movies
they were gonna
keep working
with Richard
Williams to
make even
more shorts
they were going
to make sequels
more than one
just like with
Chinatown
it didn't work
out
partly because
this was made
as a deal
between Disney
and Amblin
right
right
and Steven Spielberg's
relationship with
Disney
got kind of
sour
he didn't really
want to work
with Disney
in the first
place
and then it
became kind of
this war of
wills between
him and Eisner
became a legal
battle as to
like who
how can we
exploit Roger
Rabbit
as a franchise
who exploited
Roger Rabbit
who censored
Roger Rabbit
who whacked
him
yeah
who whacked
him off
it was Jessica
who grabbed
him by the
notion
so after a
lot of notions
and I think
this is part of
the big
disappointment
for Richard
Williams
is where
he runs
into more
money problems
because he
thinks that
this is going
to be
the pig
teeth that
he can suck
on for a
while
right
and it
turns out
not to
be that
for him
yeah
and yeah
it's interesting
that it's just
because of
basically feuds
between producers
and not
and it's not
the Warner
Brothers issue
it's Amblin
it's Spielberg
and Disney
so this
thing
kind of
avoids
being franchised
and avoids
I mean
Eisner ran
everything
into the
ground
back then
yeah
this could
have been
slopped
yeah
it could
have been
slopped
it could
have been
straight to
video
you know
there's like
it's a piece
there's a lot
of art
obviously
this happens
too but I
feel like
this movie
so specifically
I can name
7,000 things
that could
and should
have gone
wrong with
it
right it
shouldn't be
good at
all
it maybe
shouldn't exist
so much
about it
it's just
like I said
to Josh
the other day
it's a miracle
I don't know
it's a miracle
and yeah
the fact that
Eisner wasn't
able to drive
it into the
ground with
10 million
direct to
VHS sequels
it just now
stands as
this singular
work that
encapsulates
a moment
and is unlike
anything else
that has ever
been made
before and
probably ever
will be made
and also
unlike a lot
of movies
from this
time
has a point
of view
about labor
exploitation
and the
built public
environment
that doesn't
really slot in
nicely with
Reagan era
movies generally
including
Back to the
Future
famously
Back to the
Future
is a
movie
scared off
Crispin
Glover
he was too
woke for it
he was right
and they hung
upside down
for it
and then used
actual footage
of him
and then he
was able to
sue and was
again right
and he got a
lot more money
check this out
Crispin Glover
more like
Crispin Glover
fucking shit
wow
my god
it's a shame
he had to sell
his name in
rights to an
N64 game
Rayman
yes
no you're
you're talking
about Glover
no no I
know I
the game where
you play as
the hamburger helper
you play as
the hamburger helper
and you throw
your ball at
things
you can change
that ball to
whatever you
want but you
throw your
balls
and you fight
right hand
much like
Robert Zemeckis
had to do
while filming
this fight
his right hand
do we have
we have enough
time for like
a 45 minute
digression on
Banjo-Tooie
can we get you
back on to
talk about
Banjo-Tooie
I'll talk about
Space Station
Silicon Valley
let's fucking
go
here
tech war
I want to say
something about
this film that
I think is
remarkable and I
think it's in
its use of
cameos and
why they work
because I don't
know if we
never ever really
got into a
discussion about
that particularly
but it's because
they don't set
them up to be
moments where you
stand up and
applaud
yeah
they're not the
main focus of
any scene that
they're in
the focus is
always directed
at Bob Hoskins
it is always
directed at the
story
there isn't a
moment where
like Bugs Bunny
comes on screen
and then there's
just like
it's like
re-watching a lot
of the Marvel
movies of the
past like 10
years you just
have these weird
silences
they just wait
for entrance
applause
basically
Star Wars did
this too
but like I
think a lot of
times too
yeah if you're
watching like
Space Jam 2
or Ready Player
1
the reference is
for you
and here I
think every
reference is for
the animators
that are making
the movie
yeah and also
in like in
Who From Roger
Rabbit it's like
there to build
the world and
build the story
like there's like
a working actor
like Mickey Mouse
who's like off
work right now
he's in his own
house whereas
like in Ready
Player 1 it's
like and there's
Master Chief in
the background
it's a little
easter egg for
you to pick out
it's like what
the fuck is the
point who cares
this movie has
like such a deep
understanding of the
characters and how
they would slot
into this world
and like understands
that Mickey Mouse is
a little imp
it would never
put the Iron
Giant
in it as a
laser gun
yeah right
to the point of
cohesive world
building putting
stories together
things like that
care
Maddie
you wrote a
fantastic book
called Boys
Weekend
and if you'd
like to take a
moment to tell
folks about that
anything else that
you're up to
here's me
hi
hi
so Boys
Weekend
came out last
year you can
get it at any
of your local
bookstores or
your library if
you're want to
get it in a
library
not give me
any money
you're a
library person
you're one of
those
oh god
there's been a
knock at the
door
they're a
library
no the
library is
great
read the book
from the
library
but it's
in stores
now it's
called Boys
Weekend
it's about
like a
trans feminine
person who
goes on a
bachelor party
weekend and
sort of like a
futuristic Las
Vegas and then
things get worse
from there
like if Elon
Musk ran
Rapture from
Bioshock
that's sort of
the vibe
I kind of
the vibe
yeah
I will say
I read it
you gave me
you signed my
copy I bought a
copy directly from
you at a con
and at the time
I was still
working for a
tech company
oh yeah
and I think I
remember messaging
you about this
and being like
holy fucking shit
like this is just
in many ways
the experience that
I have going to
work every day
and it makes me
want to die
yeah
but also it gives
another way out
a way that is
true a way that
is you know
genuine and
germane to
the experience
of the protagonist
I thought it was
a really really
beautiful story
and I think
everybody should
read it
thank you
yeah I'm
very proud of
it
and it's like
yeah it's funny
and it's a little
scary and
I'm very happy
with it
I just finished
a new book
that'll be out
next summer
hopefully pre-orders
for that will go
up very soon
let's see what
else is going
I got a couple
of podcasts
temporal culture war
which is about
Star Trek enterprise
and the early
2000s sort of
sick American culture
I've got a new
podcast called
No Gods No
Mayors it's
about to come
out with
Riley November
friends of all
shows
the friends of
all possible
shows
and if you
like you can
find me online
pretty easily
just Matty
Lepchansky
I got a
patreon where I
post my comics
every week
that helps me
to live my
life and eat
food and
have a you
know feed my
cats and stuff
yeah go sign
up for that
patreon we've
we've actually
been subscribers
to that patreon
for a very
long time
that's true
one of our
first I think
yeah
all those links
right down in
the show notes
go check them
out of course if
you want more
of our shit
we also have a
patreon patreon.com
slash worst of all
we do premium
episodes every other
week that's five
bucks to get access
to those as well
as fancy movie time
with Brian and AJ
where they talk
about fancy movies
or for ten bucks
you can get access
as well to our
lads cast which is
just an hour a month
where we shoot the
shit about what's on
our mind and we
started doing it as a
video podcast at least
for the time being
yeah we'll see if
we do it again
it was easy enough
it was time consuming
but yeah and we've
also just put out like
a little bonus episode
for those of you who
like our adventures in
odyssey coverage
yeah because we of
course unlocked that
episode with
premium from last week
and so if you want
more of that odyssey
shenanigans we talked
about an episode with
Edwin Blaggard
played by Earl Bowen
at his hammiest
absolutely so yeah get
on it so there's a
scene in Roger
Rabbit where Roger is
hiding in the back of
this speakeasy and
Judge Doom is trying
to seek him out and
he goes and tries to
intimidate the egg man
from earlier and Bob
Hoskins like we're
screwed that guy's gonna
rat us out and Roger's
like no he won't I
made him laugh he'll be
fine and the guy ends
up not ratting him out
but it's like it is
one of those moments
that makes Bob Hoskins
start believing again
in like you know basic
humanity and that he
can trust other people
again and that
specifically what Roger
does is worthwhile and
I think when you watch
something like who
framed Roger Rabbit it
can be very easy to
dismiss it as being a
silly cartoon that is
also happens to be this
noir story but I
sit and I watch it and
I feel like Roger
watching Goofy where
it's just this stuff
like Maddie you were
saying it matters it is
important and man that
guy's just such a
fucking pro huh I'm the
worst of all possible
AJ's I'm the worst of
all possible Brian and
I'm the worst of all
possible Josh's we will
see you next week
