On this season, we'll explore our most ingrained beliefs, delusions, and archetypes,
the ways that cognitive dissonance shapes our culture, and how our reality is created
by the stories we tell. I'm your host, Chelsea Weber-Smith, and this is American Hysteria.
All of these things are manifesting. It truly amazes me of how it works.
Gold became the magic word that changed the history of our nation.
This is the honestest gamble that the poor man for his nickels and dimes can have.
Oh, where'd you find that?
Same place I discovered all these things. Right beneath our feet.
That's amazing.
Once when I was a kid, I was at a big fair with my family, and my granny, known as the
Lucky One, decided to play a carnival game, something I've only ever seen her do once
in my entire life. The game worked like this. The player rolled a rubber ball across a plane
of different colored cups, most of which were red, a loss, a few of which were yellow, a small prize,
and one of which was black, the jumbo prize. I can see it perfectly in my memory, that gentle roll,
the ball bumping over the red and the yellow, and then settling flawlessly into the single black cup.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner.
The rest of the day, I was flanked by an enormous white bear wearing shiny plush ice skates,
and I was ready to show off to any and everyone just how rich I had gotten in a single moment of luck.
But there was something else to it. I had focused all my belief into that rolling ball,
and I felt almost as if I had imbued it with magic. My dad used to tell me that if I believed
hard enough, as Jesus said, I could move a mountain, and not only that, there would be gold in those hills.
Another time, I closed my eyes and believed so hard I forgot to breathe, hoping to win a basketball
in an art fair drawing. I did win that basketball, and as I bounced it through the crowd, I kept feeling
like I had some kind of power. I felt that my ritual believing had worked. Of course, it's easy to say
that it didn't, and that's what I'm supposed to do here at American Hysteria. I know it was my first
run-in with that pesky confirmation bias that created the illusion for me that my belief had
indeed created my reality. I forgot all the times I had not won the drawing, all the times I lost at
the bright, loud carnival games. This is just one quirky suburban kid's example of a much bigger
phenomenon in American culture, the dream to get rich quick, and the various ideas about just how
to make that happen. For this episode, we'll look at some distinct manifestations of this wild fantasy,
what we call the American dream, the California dream, and the Harlem dream, and how these very
different psychologies have come together to create the American story of wealth and hope.
The early colonists, the bizarre treasure hunters, those that rushed west at the hope of finding gold,
the stories of enslaved people with their windfalls of cash, and an underground lottery that formed in
Harlem and kept the Black community economically stable for decades. We'll also look at the
modern popular manifestation of getting rich quick through simply using the thoughts in your head
to create your own reality. We'll look at another kind of dream too, the idea that what we dream while
we're asleep could be a guiding light to illuminate just where our treasures lie, and that the notion of
rituals and magic can give us everything we desire. That if we believe, that if we visualize,
if we manifest, we can have a lavish life of untold riches, or more simply, economic security,
and even more simply than that, freedom itself.
You attract in your life whatever you think about because thoughts are things. I'm sure you've heard
of the law of attraction because of the hit movie The Secret. This is my vision board from 2007. I've got a
diamond ring and vacations on here because I love the beach. And you won't believe this, but the ring
that I got when I got engaged, it looks identical to the one on my vision board. I didn't even go to
pick out the ring. It was really cool. Many of us may remember this New York Times best-selling
self-help book and the movie that preceded it, The Secret, which taught that through your thoughts,
you can manifest whatever future you desire, including, perhaps most often by American standards,
extravagant wealth. The Secret, written by bleach blonde, Bindi-wearing, Australian TV producer
Rhonda Byrne in 2006, is one of an onslaught of self-help books touting what they call the law of
attraction. That is, that anything you want, you can have by visualizing and manifesting health, love,
and especially wealth, simply if you visualize it enough. You can find hundreds of books, programs,
lectures, and corporate courses that have evolved out of this philosophy. At this point, it's become
commonplace. Now, the key here isn't hoping and making goals. That's great. Though highly critiqued
for its pseudoscience and quantum physics, The Secret has many testimonials to its success,
and I don't necessarily believe that it's a bad way to live or a bad way to think. But there's more.
The film version tells of a woman who visualized her cancer away with no medical treatment, and this is
the philosophy of the founder of this new thought movement, Phineas Quimby, who allegedly cured his
tuberculosis with just the power of positive thinking, and he popularized this personal power in the mid-1800s.
The direct influence for her work, as stated by Rhonda Byrne, came in 1910 in a book called
The Science of Getting Rich by Wallace D. Waddles, which highlighted the fact that the
Christian church had often valued and promoted poverty and austerity. But to Wallace D. Waddles,
what was natural was abundance, and one could not reach their full spiritual and personal potential
if they were poor. Quote,
By thought, you can cause the gold in the hearts of the mountains to be impelled toward you.
Waddles wrote,
The first English settlers to sail to what would become America did not come for religious freedom,
but did so in the very first American Get Rich Quick scheme, a search for gold funded by the
Virginia Company of London. They would invest 222,000 pounds, which is about 20 million in today's dollar,
into the project. Those financing this dangerous mission taken on by 105 people in 1607 lost pretty much
their entire investment. The only thing that would be returned to the London Company would be shiploads of
pirate, in layman's terms, fool's gold, with the explorers not realizing that they themselves had been
duped. As funding from the London Company ran thin, the English version of the lottery performed in the
New Settlements would come to provide a future for the colonists who were dying at an incredible rate.
The earliest evidence of an official lottery was found to date back to 1720, but it's certain that they were
popular before this time. In the 1720 lottery, for a small sum of 20 shillings, 350 locals could enter into a contest
to win a brick house in Philadelphia. It's safe to say that without these competitions of luck, the colonies would
have never been able to survive, and the America we know today would have never been built. Following these gold
hunters would come the Protestants, of which the Puritans were a part, and they had an unabiding focus on work ethic and a
belief that this work was a sign of possible salvation. As Calvinists, many of those under this umbrella
believed that the people going to heaven were predestined already by God, completely under his
control and will, and at the end of the day, there was nothing a person could do to assure their place
in heaven. All they could really do was work and pray and keep their heads down and avoid the pride and
avarice of the wealthy, all in hopes of getting rich quick on those golden streets of heaven.
On the other side, the explorers who came to find gold were agents of chance, of risk, looking for the
riches of heaven on earth while they were still alive.
The colonies in the east and the south began to grow and stabilize, mostly through capital produced
by tobacco made possible by slave and indentured servant labor. But many of those who were not
striking it rich as plantation owners revived the earlier spirit of American treasure hunting.
Occultic traditions wound through the lives of adventurers, no longer seeking the natural
discovery of gold for some other nation, but the legends of buried treasure by pirates and other
mythical peoples with treasures that for once they could keep for themselves. These treasure hunts
relied on astrology, dreams, diviners, and rituals. Most importantly was the seer, an archetype who could be
a man, man, woman, or child, and if they had a dream three times, it would reveal the area of a potential treasure chest.
A divining rod was thus employed, created from a Y-shaped twig ranging from 18 inches to 2 feet long.
The rod would be held in the hand and carried across the land until it twisted downward, indicating where they
should begin to dig. But wait! You think the spirits would allow just any man to access their untold riches?
Think again. Often the seekers believed that demonic forces guarded the treasure, sometimes in the form of
an animal, like a dog or a cat or a snake, but most often the ghost of a young boy who had been murdered and
buried along with the treasure in order to protect it. Other times it was a horseman holding his own head and
blowing blue fire into the sky. In order to deal with these potential spirits, there were rituals that had to be followed.
The most important was silence. Any misstep or words spoken could cause a noise and frighten the treasure away. Literally.
It was widely believed that the chests could run away from the men underground, soil and grass rising and falling with its path like it was a cartoon.
In order to prevent these runaways, hunters would dig elaborate ditches around the site or use a more magical method, drawing wide,
witchy circles that acted as force fields for demons. In some accounts, a hen would be sacrificed and her blood used,
along with hog dung, to be smeared on the spikes along the perimeter of the circle.
Grasping a Bible, the astrologer of the group might hold a sword up to the sky, using the planets to help direct the ritual,
telling whether or not a dog should be sacrificed or maybe a sheep lit on fire.
These rituals and the hunt for treasure in general was annoying to contemporary Ben Franklin, who wrote in an essay, quote,
You can hardly walk half a mile out of town on any side without observing several pits dug with that design.
And perhaps some men, otherwise of very good sense, have been drawn into this practice through an overweening desire of sudden wealth,
and an easy credulity of what they so earnestly wished might be true.
In the next century, these stories of buried gold would no longer read like children's books full of pirates and ghosts,
but instead would be produced by the natural world, all the way in California, all the way in the West,
a place that already represented untold possibilities as the nation kept manifesting its own prosperous destiny.
In the year 1848, the western half of the United States was a wild and unsettled land,
but new gold deposits were discovered in California, and thousands of Americans were lured across the plains to seek their fortunes.
Gold became the magic word that changed the history of our nation.
The first discovery of gold in the West was in January of 1848 by James Wilson Marshall,
who was working under his employer, James Sutter.
Marshall noticed an unfamiliar shine in the small channel of water leading to the mill that supported his farmland.
They tested it, and this time, it wasn't the fool's kind.
Despite the rumors that followed, America had been fooled too many times,
and at first, there wasn't much interest in the whispers of California gold.
That is, until one sly dog named Sam Brennan ran through the streets of San Francisco over and over screaming,
Gold! Gold in the American River!
And shaking a chunk of it inside a glass jar while he published successful accounts in his personal newspaper.
Suddenly, thousands flocked into this land near this tiny town called San Francisco,
whose population jumped from 200 to tens of thousands.
And by 1854, a span of just six years, 300,000 people would enter the area from all over the world.
But instead of focusing on finding gold himself, Sam Brennan focused on what the influx of people would need to get by.
He drove up the prices of shovels and gold pans to exorbitant levels,
eventually selling single eggs to the desperate folks for the current equivalent of $25.
Coffee was hiked up to the equivalent of $100 a pound, and new boots would set you back $2,500.
Of course, Sam Brennan and those who copied his method were not the only Gold Rush hucksters.
When selling to potential buyers of rich land, the men who owned the mines would simply create the appearance of gold.
Using their shotguns loaded with gold dust, they would shoot into the sides of the mines until they sparkled,
what we now know as salting the mine.
If that wasn't enough, the scammers would place pieces of gold into the sticks of dynamite
that would explode open the sides of the cave before the eyes of the buyer to ensure that the gold ran deep.
But sometimes those buyers were keen to their tricks and brought their own dynamite.
To counter this, and let me caveat here and say I couldn't corroborate this enough to claim that it's true,
but it's just so good,
the sellers would sprinkle gold dust into their chewing tobacco and spit it into the mine's crevices.
Or they would consume a liquid elixir called bichloride of gold,
which was once used to cure alcoholism and kidney problems and then urinate into those cracks,
which allegedly would also create the appearance of gold.
But I'm no scientist.
This wild pop cultural circus changed the search for instant wealth into a kind of national obsession,
replacing the generations of a widespread focus on that Protestant work ethic.
The California dream took its seat next to the American one.
The 49ers, as the early gold rushers were called,
moved that mountain all right, and sometimes there was gold underneath.
But most of the time, they came away with only modest gains,
and many, many men were ruined by the choice to leave their old lives behind.
The Gilded Age, as it would come to be known, followed the gold rush,
and was a time of rapid economic growth in the West,
the expansion of the railroads across the nation.
As industry boomed in the cities after the Industrial Revolution,
robber barons or wealthy entrepreneurs concentrated their vast fortunes
by busting unions and crushing their competitors
until the rich became the super, super rich
and the working class lived even more so below the poverty line.
Sequestered to rat-infested tenements working 12-hour days,
often alongside their own children,
and they still struggled to buy loaves of bread.
The underlying problems of poverty were covered in a thin veneer of gold,
as author Mark Twain encapsulated when he named the Gilded Age
with his typical tongue-in-cheek wit.
For many throughout American history, their dreams were far more modest,
as it was near to impossible to believe that they might one day rise into that upper class.
Before emancipation, it was far more likely for black people to be won in a lottery
than to imagine winning even their very freedom, their dignity, their safety.
As slavery became the foundation of American wealth,
George Washington would continue the lottery in 1769
with prizes of orchards, lumber, fertile fields,
and most often, enslaved men, women, and children.
Fifty years later, an enslaved man named Denmark Vesey would do the same
and use his money to buy his freedom,
and using his new freedom would eventually lead
what would have been the largest and bloodiest slave uprising in American history.
Two of the other leaders of this mission were mystics.
The first, a blind preacher named Philip,
who had the powers of second sight,
and often was said to foretell the future with messages he received in his dreams.
The second was a man named Gullah Jack,
who gave each of the uprisers a crab claw to carry in their mouths
that would render them invincible against white retaliation.
But the plan was foiled,
and Denmark Vesey was sentenced to death and subsequently hanged.
Just a few years later,
famous abolitionist writer and enslaved man Frederick Douglass
would be inspired by the work of Denmark Vesey,
but not the more superstitious elements that seeped into the plans of revolt.
Like Benjamin Franklin,
with his rationalism and disdain for the belief in magical thinking,
Protestant Christian Frederick Douglass also dismissed ritual as ridiculous,
even demonic,
but couldn't deny one experience that didn't make him rich in money,
but set him on a new path toward the greatest wealth he could imagine at the time,
his own freedom.
In 1834, Frederick was sent to Maryland by his master for his insubordination,
where lived a man named Edward Covey,
who was famous for his ability to break those considered troublesome slaves.
Here, Frederick underwent terrible torture, beatings, and grueling labor,
which did come close to breaking his spirit.
But one day, while making his way through the local woods,
he met another enslaved man named Sandy Jenkins,
who he called a genuine African,
one who, quote,
believed in a system for which I have no name.
After listening to Frederick's situation,
Sandy Jenkins decided he wanted to help him,
and instructed him to find a particular herb
native to the area and to wear it on his right side.
The mysterious man told Frederick that he had been wearing the same herb for years,
and that he had never been beaten by any slaveholder since.
Initially, Frederick scoffed at the thought,
but when Sandy mentioned that his religion and the books he'd been reading
had not yet offered him any real protection,
and reminded him that there was nothing to lose by trying out this ritual,
Frederick foraged for the herb and tied it to his right hip.
The next day, when the slave master came to beat him,
Frederick did the unthinkable.
He fought back, hard,
and for two hours, the men struggled.
In the end, it was Frederick who won the fight,
and he also scared the shit out of a cowering Edward Covey.
Frederick was shocked at his own actions,
unsure what had come over him,
when just the day before,
he couldn't have imagined taking a risk like that.
He knew what would happen.
He would be publicly whipped or even killed for a crime like that.
But Covey never reported him to any authorities,
and he faced no penalties for those actions.
Remarkably, by Frederick's own account,
Covey would never lay a finger on him ever again.
The easy manner in which I got off was always a surprise to me.
Later, Frederick said that this event
was one of the most important moments in his life
that would help him reach his eventual freedom.
Though he still denied the power of that talisman
with his rational, educated mind,
a part of him couldn't help but wonder.
Speaking of Sandy Jenkins,
Frederick would acknowledge that, quote,
A slight gleam or shadow of his superstition
had fallen on me.
Hitting the number can also move the spirit mightily.
But it's the honestest gamble
that the poor man for his nickels and dimes can have,
or the poor man's stock market.
I'm sure people have heard that phrase.
Almost a hundred years later,
the same spirit would take hold in 1920s Harlem
as it would in many other American cities
when a new underground version of the lottery
rose to extreme popularity,
one that would carry many, many black folks
through the Great Depression and beyond.
Known as the numbers game,
or simply the numbers,
this was a brainchild of a black immigrant
from the West Indies named Casper Holstein.
Using the knowledge he'd gained
working as a messenger for the stock exchange,
he created a new system
that would produce a winner every day
with far less of a chance of the game being fixed.
Though the numbers game wasn't a legal enterprise,
it became one of the major cultural marks
of the Harlem Renaissance.
And it became so popular, in fact,
that the black community began greeting each other
not with a hello,
but instead with a hearty,
what was it?
With the response being
the three-digit number of the day.
This gamble wasn't going to get any player rich
by white American standards,
but the modest windfalls they could receive
off a nickel a day would make all the difference
in the lives of those with low incomes
in a city where 80% of the businesses
were owned by whites
that didn't even live in Harlem.
Many used their winnings
to open up businesses of their own
or to send their kids to college.
Enter Stephanie St. Clair,
an educated black immigrant
who was the only woman
to ever have control over the Harlem lottery.
After allegedly stabbing her abusive boyfriend
in the eye with a fork
after he tried to force her into sex work,
she got involved with the illegal policy banks
that ran the numbers game,
the only place where black people
could invest their money
as they were not allowed to use legal banks.
Eventually, Stephanie invested $10,000
into her own bank
and her career in the numbers game took off.
Known as Madam Queen or just Queenie,
Stephanie was a hero and a villain simultaneously,
ruthless and generous and very well-dressed,
often wearing a signature fur coat made of squirrels
along with pearls
and her carefully styled hair
topped with fashionable hats or a turban.
You could say that Queenie did get rich relatively quick
because at the height of her career,
she was making $20,000 a year,
which in today's dollar is $300,000.
Though Casper Holstein and Queenie
were rivals in the business
as well as vicious and sometimes violent
in their dealings,
they both used their success
to invest in the Harlem community.
Casper, called, quote,
Harlem's favorite hero
by the New York Times in 1928,
funded education scholarships
and literacy programs for residents,
while Queenie supported Black-owned policy banks
and took out articles in local papers
that educated Black people
about their legal rights,
as well as ones that called out
instances of police brutality.
Both would employ a vast number
of people of color within their businesses,
with the numbers almost single-handedly
supporting the underground Black economy.
There were some very interesting parallels
between the numbers game,
the rituals that led lottery winner
Denmark Vesey's plans for his slave revolt,
and Frederick Douglass's mysterious abilities
given to him, apparently,
by a mystical man in the woods.
Also not unlike the treasure-hunting movement
we talked about earlier,
those that played the numbers in Harlem
relied heavily on dreams
and their interpretations.
Like those who made their money
from the gold rush,
capitalizing on the hope to get rich quick,
a great deal of men and women
were also creating a side industry
that complemented the underground economy.
Psychics, numerologists, palm readers,
and crystal ball gazers.
The extremely popular Aunt Sally's Policy Players
Dream Book became a staple
for any serious numbers player,
along with others like
Old Aunt Dinah's Dream Book of Numbers
and Gypsy's Witch Dream Book of Numbers,
all of which offered three-digit numbers
based on a huge variety of symbols
that appeared in the players' dreams.
Also for sale were various products
derived from the West African traditions
of hoodoo,
like psalm prayer candles,
incense, potions,
and small bags containing lucky items.
One such item was the very popular
John the Conqueror Root,
based on a hero of Black folklore,
an African prince sold into American slavery
who once used his cunning
to outsmart his master.
In the story,
John falls in love with the devil's daughter
and gallops back to Africa with her
after stealing the devil's own horses.
Writing of the myth,
Black author of
Their Eyes Were Watching God,
Zora Neale Hurston,
said,
quote,
You will know then
that no matter how bad things look now,
it will be worse for those
who seek to oppress us.
Though I couldn't find confirmation,
it sounds like this could be the root
that Frederick Douglass wore at his side
when he wailed on the slave master
without fear,
eventually escaping his own version of the devil.
The spiritual aspect of the numbers game
was abundantly clear,
adding yet another dimension
to its psychological importance.
Black singer and civil rights activist,
Lena Horne,
said of the Black Lottery,
quote,
In the Negro ghetto,
it's about the only hope you can afford.
Poet Langston Hughes
reiterated the same feeling,
quote,
The numbers is the salvation of Harlem,
its Medicare,
its little liver pills,
its vitamins,
its aspirins,
and its analgesic balm combined.
But as prohibition ended
and both the Italian and Jewish mafias
were looking for new ways to make money,
the Black Run numbers game
soon began to face their wrath
and fight back with a wrath of their own.
Black numbers runners
were beaten or murdered
if they wouldn't give control
of their businesses
or portions of their earnings
to mob boss Dutch Schultz,
the only way they would be allowed
to keep their jobs.
With many deaths on both sides,
police payoffs,
and political bribing,
the power of the white mobs
overtook the numbers game
and Queenie and Casper
would be ousted from power
by the early 1930s.
Although a huge blow to Black Harlem,
the numbers game would continue
to support their underground economy
through the Great Depression
and all the way into the 1970s.
By 1971,
the New York Times reported,
quote,
60% of the area's economic life
depends on the cash flow
from the numbers.
The numbers,
which employed 100,000 workers
across five boroughs.
Numbers runners
and policy banks
still followed
in Queenie and Casper's footsteps
by bankrolling small businesses
and donating to civil rights groups
and Black political candidates' campaigns.
But of course,
the government wouldn't let this stand forever.
The numbers game
was making nearly a billion dollars a year
by 1980.
And so lawmakers in New York
copied the structure themselves
and then painted the Black numbers men
as criminals,
ignoring the calls
to simply legitimize
the underground lottery
that was already booming
that would continue to benefit
a marginalized population.
But of course,
the almost all-white assembly
took over completely
with a promise
to funnel the profits
into state education funds,
something we're still told
about the modern state lotteries
to this very day.
Speaking of,
do our modern lotteries
that offer millions
and millions in prizes
and who donate
a substantial amount,
millions,
or even as some claim,
a billion dollars a year
of their profits
to public schools
actually help?
Well, not really.
It seems like a great idea
in theory,
one not unlike
the numbers runners
supporting local education.
But what really happens
with the lottery
is that the state
receives the money
in their education budgets,
but not as a supplement.
They use the money
to pay for the budget
and then reallocate
the state money elsewhere.
So it doesn't actually
improve schools,
it just keeps things the same.
Low-income folks
still invest far more
in the lottery
than their middle
and upper-class counterparts,
who tend to look down
on this kind of gambling
as irresponsible
and downright stupid.
Put one way,
the lottery,
as run by the state,
uses its low-income residents
as a way to pay
for education,
while the tax rates
for the wealthiest in America
have continued to plummet.
You might say
that money
has become
our main American god,
not because
we're some particularly
greedy nation,
but because we tell
a story about it.
We hold a dream,
a dream that does come true
on rare occasions,
but mostly hangs,
hopefully,
in some future golden air.
First,
it came in the form
of the American dream,
the Protestant work ethic
carried over the Atlantic
that accompanied
a belief
that any material prosperity
you may acquire
was a sign
of your favor
with God,
some shred
of evidence
that perhaps
you might be
one of the chosen ones
that will get rich quick
right after you die.
The explorers,
a lineage of adventurers
that would later
face the West's wilderness
to find the California
dream of gold,
thought that maybe wealth
had little to do
with morals
and instead valued
the excitement
of this chaos
of risk
and a windfall
of wealth
to enjoy
in this lifetime.
The Harlem dream,
a lineage stretching back
to the legacy
of Denmark Vesey
and Frederick Douglass
up through the modest winds
of the numbers game,
was a dream
of simply rising
to some level
of personal stability,
first through the hope
of freedom
and then the potential
to make enough money
to live a decent life.
The hope to get rich quick
is a mystical one,
long imbued with magic.
It is a belief
of the simplest sort,
an easy belief,
a belief in future power
and future ease,
a belief in the transformative self
and the potential
to transform
into a divine being
as those
at the top
of our hierarchy
almost seem to appear,
at least with the privileges
that they're afforded.
It's true
that accruing wealth
does make people's lives better,
but there's more to it
than that,
at least according
to an extensive study
by Purdue University
that surveyed
1.7 million people worldwide
and found that
the ideal yearly income
for a single American citizen
to reach a kind of
maximum happiness
and contentment
was between
$70,000 and $105,000 a year.
And anything above $105,000
seemed to add
no real benefits
to emotional well-being
and overall
even showed
a slight decrease
in that happiness.
Of course,
most of us earn
nowhere near those figures
and the average
American yearly income
is about $48,000 a year,
but that's still much higher
than what's earned
by black workers
who average
about $39,000 a year.
And these figures
still feel high
for the service workers
who earn on average
$28,000 a year
with black service workers
making even less.
It's no wonder
that Americans hope
for a windfall of cash.
It can and usually does
make a person's life easier.
It gives them more freedom
and time and ability
to focus on the things
that make them feel good.
So don't believe
that old adage
that says money
can't buy happiness,
but consider
that the very rich
could be happier
if they weren't hoarding
all that cash.
Unfortunately,
the story of wealth
has also been one
of who is deserving.
The Secret tells us that,
the only reason a person
does not have enough money
is because they are blocking money
from coming to them
with their thoughts.
A statement that wholly disregards
the systemic issues
that create poverty.
As mentioned,
The Secret's biggest influence
was The Science of Getting Rich
and that book went even further.
In it,
Wallace D. Wattles
tells us not to pity the poor
and not to help them either.
He forbids the, quote,
study of poverty
and warns against
trying to understand
and affect the systems
that create poverty themselves.
He tells us that the poor
do not need help.
They don't need charity.
He says, quote,
Inspiration will cause them
to rise out of their misery.
If you want to help the poor,
demonstrate to them
that they can become rich.
Prove it
by getting rich yourself.
You know,
just make a vision board
for your local homeless shelter
and arrive in your newest fur coat.
Do not try to understand
the conditions
that create poverty.
Do not do anything
to combat them
or you will attract
that very poverty
to yourself.
I have to wonder,
is hope
the greatest American hysteria
of all?
Of course it isn't.
It's so easy,
I know,
to laugh at the rituals
of the treasure hunters
and the gold rushers,
the roots at the hip,
the incense,
the dream books.
That's certainly
what I'm supposed to do here,
isn't it?
Debunk hope.
But I don't wanna.
And anyway,
there is evidence
that a sense of hope
can better our mental
and even physical health
and lead to greater successes.
It's a vital part
of a happy life,
just as a certain level
of income is.
Hope, unfortunately,
is not exactly
what books like
The Secret
traffic in.
I like positive thinking.
I believe it can help us
in almost every way.
It's the other side
of the message
that scares me
when it teaches
that our failures
are all our fault,
that if we just got it right,
if we were just good enough,
if we just thought
the right way,
our wealth
would be a given.
The Secret author,
Rhonda Byrne,
certainly visualized
her wealth
and got rich quick
when she appeared
on The Oprah Winfrey Show
in 2007,
leading to $300 million
in sales,
several more book deals,
and a line
of The Secret merchandise,
with Rhonda's estimated
net worth
reaching $100 million.
We Americans now
are no different
in our search
for this secret,
dreamy language
that can lead
to a windfall of cash.
Just look at this
wonderful recent example
from 2005,
when 110 lottery players
beat the 1 in 3 million odds
and got that second place prize,
leading the officials
to open an investigation
into fraud.
What did they find?
Every winner
had taken their number combo
from a fortune cookie.
Cookies from a variety
of Chinese restaurants.
Cookies that had all been made
in the same factory
in Queens, New York,
and just happened
to fall into the hands
of serious lotto players,
all of which ended up
costing the lottery
a pretty $19 million
that they weren't expecting
to pay out.
The very skeptical
Frederick Douglass
tied that root
of an African folk hero
to his hip
with only the smallest
glimmer of hope
that it could set him free.
And he outran
the greatest devil
of his lifetime.
We cannot escape
the feeling
that there is
an invisible hand
guiding us,
that if we just do
things exactly right,
like the treasure hunters
once thought,
we will receive
the rewards
restricted to the luckiest
among us,
the elect,
the blessed.
Psychologists have long known
that ritual itself
is a built-in part
of being human,
as the brain's
main function
is essentially
to predict
the future.
It takes in information
all the time
so that eventually
we know
what to look out for,
how to stay safe
from predators,
what's safe to eat,
where are the safe places
to sleep,
and what can we take
comfort in,
and what do we need
to fear.
When the brain
can do this function,
it gives us a sense
of safety and happiness,
but when it can't,
we feel threatened
and anxious.
Ritual is the hope
to control
an uncertain future.
Ritual is a hope
that everything
will be okay,
and this includes,
most often,
the ritual
to become
financially stable,
to be free
from a life
of pain.
Perhaps this
is part
of the secret's
power.
Even if it doesn't
work scientifically
as proponents
will say it does,
creating vision boards
can certainly
alleviate anxiety
about the future,
and that,
in and of itself,
is a gift.
Since its very beginnings,
colonial America
has always been
a get-rich-quick country,
from the first
gold explorations
to the lotteries
that funded
colonial expansion
to the treasure hunts,
the gold rush,
and all our modern
gambles and lotteries
that we play today.
You could say
that the secret
did in fact work
for early Americans,
as they manifested
their destiny
across the long land
they came to conquer.
The dreams
on their vision boards
were powered
by their thinking,
by their certainty,
that they deserved
everything
that they wanted.
But this luck
was systematically created
on the land
of murdered
indigenous peoples,
the labor
of enslaved
black people,
and to a lesser degree
poor white immigrants,
and not to mention
our modern
working class.
Plantation owners
grew rich
on tobacco,
and the robber barons
would later grow rich
during the industrial revolution
through gold mines,
railroads,
and the stock market
until they created
generations and generations
of inherited wealth,
as well as a template
for CEOs
of our most
mega corporations.
Even in my
old age,
I'm still just as human
as everyone else.
No matter how rational,
how skeptical
any of us may be,
we cannot escape
the rituals
we need
to live.
Because hope
is just that,
a ritual,
a dream,
one that takes
the form
of whatever
we most desire.
To this day,
I can't help
but focus
all of my
childlike belief
into any
uncertainty,
hoping,
secretly,
that something
out there
might listen,
that there might be
a guiding hand
looking out
for me,
that I could
move a mountain
with just
my own version
of faith,
and that there
could be
treasure
underneath,
that if we
keep digging,
there might be
treasure
underneath
for us all.
In the silliest
of examples,
I always wondered
if some lucky
invisible force
guided my
granny's hand
that day
as she rolled
the ball
across the
hundred different
colored cups,
winning a
carnival lottery
that made me
richer than I
could have
dreamed,
as I carried
that enormous
stuffed bear
on my back
like a chest
full of
impossible
gold.
gold.
This was
American Hysteria.
Next time
on the show,
we're covering
the curse
of the lottery,
and then we're
taking a couple
weeks off
and coming back
with an episode
called
Men's Rights.
The non-profit
we'd like to
highlight this week
is called
Friends of Public
School Harlem.
Their mission
is to level
the playing field
so Harlem
students and schools
can reach
their full potential
and feel the
successes they're
capable of
and want so
much to achieve.
They use
donations to
buy iPads
and computers
for school,
to fund the
arts,
health and
wellness programs,
and fund other
needed resources
to support the
success of the
schools and
their students.
