Well, here we are now, entertain us, right?
And I know this is the part of the show where I would generally start with either some inscrutable fucking sound collage
or with a kind of incredibly elaborate radio play joke that only I will find funny,
but it will convince exactly three people that I am sending them coded messages,
which is a benefit or a deficit depending on your interests, I guess.
But this time, in order better to elucidate the concept of the Fourth Reich,
why I call it that, why I mean exactly what I'm saying,
I wanted to give you a kind of little mystic aphorism to meditate upon for the rest of the episode.
Not so much a study in contrast as a study in two sides of the same thing
that I think will help explain why it is that I say what I say.
And I want to compare two figures from the Third Reich to demonstrate its eventual evolution into the Fourth,
or rather, you could say, the extent to which the Fourth was hiding behind the Third all along.
And in order to do that, I want to compare a couple figures you've probably heard of.
One of them, a rather well-known Austrian politician named Adolf.
I take it I don't really need to tell you his life story.
Although it is kind of amazing how few people seem to know that Hitler wasn't actually his name.
The guy's name was Adolf Schickelgruber.
And I believe he changed it because he found out his biological father wasn't the guy he thought he was.
Something like that.
Alternately, there is a Lenny Bruce bit about how he changed it because he was getting into show business.
And no one wants to see Adolf Schickelgruber up on a marquee.
So take Hitler. Take what you know about Hitler.
Hitler. And then put him next to a key figure in the growth of the actual Third Reich as a political and economic apparatus.
A guy named Fritz Tyson.
Now, if you've heard the name Tyson, it might be because Fritz Tyson's company is still operating all over the world,
including to a very significant extent in the United States.
Now it is known as Tyson Krupp.
Or as the people I know who work there have said it, Tyson Krupp.
Krupp, as you may know, was the biggest arms dealing company in the world for a long time,
which we're going to get into here.
Tyson Krupp, as such, however you pronounce it in the U.S.,
has these gigantic call centers for elevator emergencies and elevator repairs.
If you get in a Tyson Krupp, Tyson Krupp elevator and it stops or something and you press the little button to call for assistance,
you are calling one of these call centers.
And there used to be a huge Tyson Krupp call center outside the city I lived in in Texas for a number of years.
And I knew people who worked there.
Still very much on the scene economically in the U.S.
And this is not important at all, but I swear to you, one of the guys I knew there who was an elevator repair dispatcher,
he had to call over and over again for the help of an elevator repairman whose name, I promise you this is real,
was Steve Cumm.
And the guy I knew the first time he met him tried to like, oh, is it like K-U-H-M or something?
The guy's like, nope, C-U-M, Steve Cumm, that's me.
So somewhere out there, God willing, Steve Cumm is still fixing elevators.
And in this Tyson Krupp marriage that came about in, I believe, the early 90s,
the Tysons historically were raw materials people.
And the Krupps were the arms dealers who used those raw materials to make weapons.
Both these companies go back to the 19th century.
To focus more specifically on Fritz Tyson, he was born in 1873 to a mining and steelmaking dynasty in the Ruhr Valley in Germany.
I don't know if it's still like this, but the Ruhr, R-U-H-R, used to be the kind of major industrial core of Germany
for the iron and steel facilities along that river valley.
And you gravity's rainbow heads, your antennae should be vibrating right now
because iron taken to make steel requires extraction of coal tars.
Those very same coal tars in which, as the ghost of Walter Rathenau put it,
there are a billion molecules just waiting for our transmutation made of species we will never see again.
Fritz Tyson was right at that interface.
And right around the same time, it was discovered that those coal tars, which had been considered dross, essentially,
were actually going to be very, very useful for the applied chemistry of the next century
for anything from plastics to pharmaceuticals.
That was the era in which young Fritz took over the dynasty from his father.
But not before, in 1923, he became a German nationalist hero
because he refused to use his iron and steel works in the Ruhr Valley
to pay off unpaid German war debt from World War I.
And I hope in the context of the Fourth Reich and what's going on in the United States
and as a result of the United States policy right now,
I hope the Americans in the audience can see the clear ominousness of the idea
of a fabulously wealthy industrialist manufacturing himself into a populist fucking folk hero.
There's some resonances with that at the moment.
So 1926, Fritz's father dies and he officially takes over the business
and consolidates all his holdings into a company called Vereinigte Stahlwerke AG,
which basically means United Steel Works.
And Gravity's Rainbow again, Vereinigte Stahlwerke AG,
is indeed mentioned at some length in that book.
And after taking over all these mining and metallurgical interests,
he started clinging to the, at that point, not very successful Nazi party.
You know, this is mid-20s we're talking about here.
Um, primarily out of terror for what communism would do to his business interests.
Uh, you know, this, this is a period where it's very much on the table
that there might be some kind of actual working class revolution in Germany.
And hence you get the assassinations of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht
and then the SA and you, you know, the story, Freikor, everything about that.
Uh, and for Fritz, uh, fascism was real, real useful in a couple of ways.
Number one, because he explicitly conceived of it as being a fake populist alternative
for the working class.
He realized, you know, this working class political firm, it's not just going to go away.
We have to get it to boil over in a controlled manner so it doesn't hurt any of us seriously.
So instead of making it about class and economics and disenfranchisement,
let's make it about shit like race and nationality,
and we can redirect all this working class anger to the right,
which of course is what happened.
The second way, uh, was that Nazism forestalled any prospect of German-Russian economic cooperation.
And this is, uh, yet another thing that you will see playing out in the headlines every fucking day
if you know where to look.
I mean, NATO was conceived, uh, in no small part to stop German-Russian economic cooperation,
to stop the idea of, of the, you know, Soviets having a major hand in the rebuilding of Germany
and in the sort of political and economic spoils that might follow,
and in fact, turning Germany communist.
Um, you know, what's the famous, uh, explanation of the purpose of NATO?
To keep the Americans in, the Russians out, and the Germans down.
We were trying to lay down a, uh, very thick line, right,
between Eastern Germany and the Soviet bloc.
And we eventually got our way, and now Germany is the head of the fucking EU.
Uh, but you can, you can zoom in even closer to the modern day
and look at something like the bombing of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline
and how Ukraine, the war that suddenly nobody cares about or is talking about anymore,
anymore, the war that suddenly is no longer the,
the greatest fight for human rights in modern history.
And if you don't stand on the right side,
history will remember you as a tyrant,
and it would be treasonous to negotiate with Putin
until, of course, today, at which point now Fox News is saying,
yeah, they should probably negotiate with Putin.
Um, I have thought since that happened
that a big reason it happened was, again,
to cut off the possibility of a major German-Russian economic relationship,
largely via fuel, via petroleum products.
Uh, and those petroleum products were, of course,
getting from Russia to Germany via the Nord Stream pipeline,
which, uh, we blew up and everyone knows we blew up,
but for some reason there are still stories every couple weeks
about how someone else did it.
Uh, in fact, there is an interview from 20,
let's see, it would be 2014, I think,
with, uh, a certain Condoleezza Rice
about what was going on at the time in Ukraine,
what we very cynically called the Euromaidan,
and tried to pretend was this, you know,
pure populist revolution,
and it was in large part actually backed by the CIA
and a bunch of CIA front NGOs,
and it had really much more to do with us
installing a Ukrainian government
that would be friendly to our interests
and antagonistic to Russia
so that we could force Russia's hand into,
I don't know, say, uh, committing to a disastrous war
at some point.
And Condoleezza Rice is being asked about
recent events in Ukraine, circa 2014.
And remember, Condoleezza Rice,
before the Bush administration,
was an oil woman.
She was a lawyer and executive for oil companies.
That's how they got her.
That's how they knew who she was
through the Bush's contacts
and the oil industry going back,
you know, at this point, nearly a century.
And in this interview,
you know, the Maidan thing is just starting.
It's very speculative.
And Condoleezza Rice,
in her sort of blunt idiot way,
gets to the point almost immediately
by saying,
you know, what's going to be really interesting
is, uh, how we
break up the relationship
between Russia and Germany
as far as oil and fuel is concerned.
Because obviously that,
that can't be allowed to go on.
So I'm really curious, you know,
over, over the coming years,
uh, to see how it is that we,
she says something like, uh,
wean Germany off Russian oil.
Which is, of course, a euphemism for
get our fucking foot in the door
for the Western European oil market
in a way we can't do now
because, uh, so much of it
essentially belongs to, uh,
the Russian state oil company,
which it's illegal for foreign investors
to buy into.
But, you know, maybe if there was
a catastrophic war,
just spitballing here,
and, uh, eventually
tons of people died on both sides
and it was a stalemate
and, and, uh, nobody really
wanted to go on with it,
maybe we could arrange
for some kind of peace conference
or treaty,
and maybe one of the conditions
of ending the war
would be that Russia
would have to open up Gazprom,
the, the national, you know,
petroleum company,
to foreign investment
and thus allow the U.S.
to buy out the Western European,
uh, oil market.
I'm just, you know,
anything can happen in life, right?
And, and you, you gotta be aware
of all these possibilities
crystallizing around you.
It could happen,
is all I'm saying,
in 2014.
So, Fritz Tyson,
mid-twenties, uh,
exactly the same sort of motivations
that people like Fritz Tyson
still have today.
Interested in fascism
as a way to co-opt
working-class anger
and as a way to keep
his own business interests
safe from anything
like socialization.
And he gradually grows
more and more enthusiastic
about the whole Nazi thing
until, uh, in 1932,
he co-authors a letter
to then-president, uh,
Paul von Hindenburg
urging him to appoint
Hitler Chancellor of Germany
because it's the people's will.
It's what the people want.
And the co-author
of this letter
was a certain
Hjalmar Schacht,
who is,
that's right,
also in Gravity's Rainbow.
Hjalmar Schacht
was the, uh,
basically the official banker
of the Third Reich.
And you may remember
in the part, uh,
in Switzerland
when Slothrop gets
the dossier
about the medical experiments
performed on him
as a child.
Schacht is one of the people
who is mentioned
in Laszlo Jampf's papers.
And, uh,
Jampf's code name
for him is
Schwindel,
as in swindle,
because he was
legendarily
fucking crooked
and basically ran
the Nazi economy,
especially in the later years,
by just moving around
imaginary money
while making sure
to feather
his own fucking nest
for when the war was over.
So,
Fritz and his buddy
Hjalmar,
uh,
encourage Hindenburg
to let Hitler
be the chancellor.
And in support of this,
uh,
for the March 1933 elections,
Fritz Tyson
whips up
the Association
of German Industrialists
into funding
that,
the Nazis
for that round
of elections
to the tune
of, uh,
three million
Reichsmarks,
which would be
about $28 million
now,
which is
fucking enormous
for campaign
contributions.
And,
as a reward
for this,
he was made
a member
of the Reichstag
once the Nazis
took over
the German government,
the Reichstag,
you know,
equivalent to being
a,
a minister of parliament,
a senator,
or something like that.
And in fact,
Tyson was so powerful
in the rise
of the Nazis
that it was a,
uh,
a common left-wing
trope at the time
in Germany
to depict
Hitler as
Tyson's puppet,
to, uh,
attribute very little
agency
to Hitler himself
and assume
he's just this
fucking psychotic
moron
who is being
used as a
convenient frontman
by industrial
interests,
which is more
true than people
want to admit
at this point
in history.
And in fact,
the, uh,
the great German,
I guess you would
call him,
like,
satirist artist,
Dada satirist,
something like that,
he,
he went by the name
John Hartfield,
uh,
because he hated
Germany so fucking
much.
I think his real name
was something like
Heinrich Herzfeld,
but he did these
kind of surrealist
and Dada,
um,
cut-up
visual pieces
in German
left-wing newspapers
at the time
and he particularly
depicted Hitler
as a puppet
of Fritz Tyson.
Now,
eventually,
uh,
things go a little
sour between
old Fritz
and the Nazi
party
because Fritz
is, uh,
he's not too
big on the
invasion of
Poland.
not on
moral grounds.
Would that,
would that shock
you to hear?
Uh,
but because
an invasion
is gonna mean
a big fucking
war,
and in a big
fucking war,
um,
industries like,
say,
steel
tend to get
nationalized
and made part
of a command
economy,
and I'm really
not looking
for my fucking
steel empire
to be,
you know,
turned into a
wing of the
state in the
bad way.
Of course I'd
love it to be
turned into a
wing of the
state in the
good way,
where actually,
uh,
the German
government works
for me,
and I can tell
them to pay me
whatever I want.
That would be
fantastic.
But,
there's a worry
here that you're
gonna fuck up my
money with this
war.
So he ends up
absconding from,
uh,
Germany,
and is kind of
floating around
Western Europe
for a few years.
uh,
but of course,
Fritz's
opposition,
his principled
opposition to
the Nazi
invasion of
Poland,
did not extend
to him,
uh,
not wanting all
the money he'd
gotten from
Nazis.
He really
wanted to keep
that shit.
And so he
figured out how
to,
uh,
launder that
money out of
Germany so he
could hold on to
it after leaving.
And,
uh,
the guy who hid
his money for him
is a name you
might know.
A certain Prescott
Bush of the
Union Banking
Corporation,
which was an
American front for
a Nazi bank in
the Netherlands.
And Prescott,
in return for
this,
I mean,
I'm sure he was
paid in a number
of ways,
but perhaps most
notably,
he got a chunk
of a Tyson
subsidiary called
the Consolidated
Salesian Steel
Company,
which was,
uh,
extremely illegal
by this point.
It was an
open violation
of the Trading
with the Enemy
Act,
and also
Salesian Steel
used slave labor
at Auschwitz,
among other
places.
And,
uh,
this is,
I mean,
these are the
core years
of the Wall
Street banking
and legal
families that
will essentially
go on to
make up the
CIA.
I've documented
that at some
length with
Alan Dulles.
of course,
Averill Harriman
is in there.
Of course,
the Bushes
are in there.
Uh,
this guy is
hiding a
Nazi
industrialist
money,
uh,
during the
war and
being paid
in kind
in,
uh,
ownership
of a
fucking
Nazi
steel
company.
Eventually,
eventually,
uh,
Fritz gets
arrested by
the Germans,
spends a
couple years
in prison.
uh,
he is
taken out
of prison
at the
end of
the war
and put
on trial
for helping
finance the
rise of
the Third
Reich,
which he
absolutely
did,
uh,
and he
was found
guilty,
and for
that role
in financing
the Nazi
Party and
the German
state,
he was
forced to
pay,
and you
really got
to get
ready for
how huge
this number
is,
okay?
He was
forced to
pay
$900,000.
$900,000
whole
dollars,
which he
apparently
managed to
convince the
court was,
uh,
10% of
his complete
net worth,
which,
A,
uh,
no,
it wasn't,
that's
bullshit,
and B,
so 10% is
where you
draw the
line for,
you know,
Auschwitz
slave labor?
10% is
where you
draw the
line for,
like,
Kristallnacht
were just
agreed that
that's a
good round
number.
All right,
um,
he eventually
gets out of
this whole,
uh,
prison and
trial situation
after paying
the princely
sum of
$900,000
to atone
for his,
uh,
evil,
and bear
in mind,
that's not
$900,000
in 1945,
that's $900,000
now,
in,
in 2023
dollars.
Um,
would you
believe he
died in
Buenos Aires?
something funny
about that,
you know,
all these
died in
Buenos Aires,
died in
Brazil,
died in
Chile.
It's weird
how that
works out.
The reason
I bring up
Fritz
Tyson,
uh,
as a
parallel case
to Hitler,
however,
and the
reason I
think he
and his
buddies at
Krupp are,
uh,
exceptionally
useful for
understanding the
concept of
the
Fourth Reich,
uh,
and of
its succession
of the
Third One,
is that,
think of
Germany in
the 30s,
uh,
really from
the 20s all
the way through
the 30s,
but the 30s
were when
Tyson was
most active
in the
Nazi Party,
right?
Now,
you would
probably say,
according to
a,
you know,
uh,
a mainstream
historical
education,
that Hitler
in Germany
had about
as much
power as
any one
person has
ever had
in a modern
nation state,
right?
Other than
fucking
Kublai Khan
decreeing a
stately
pleasure dome,
there aren't
many people
whose word
was law
in the same
way as
Hitler,
and when
they say
his word
was law,
that was
literal.
Uh,
there was
an entire
legal apparatus
led by the
jurist
Carl Schmitt
whose entire
purpose was
to,
uh,
retroactively
come up
with legal
justifications
for everything
that Hitler
said and
did,
and it
was Schmitt
who invented
the concept
of the
Führer
Principe,
that is,
the Führer
Principle,
which is to
say that,
okay,
I know it
seems bad
in a supposedly
representative
government
that one
guy can
say and
do anything
and it
becomes the
new rule
of the
land,
right?
I know
that seems
bad,
but here's
the thing,
what do
we call
Adolf
Hitler?
We call
him our
Führer,
our leader,
and why
is he our
leader?
Why do
we call
him that?
Because
Führer,
Hitler,
is the
incarnation
of the
authentic
German
will.
He is
the
volkish
German
will
made
flesh,
and so
he does
not ever
act
in his
own
interest.
He never
acts of
his own
accord.
He doesn't
make decisions
because they
benefit him
or he likes
the results.
He makes
them because
they are
the expression
of the
absolute
purified
essence
of the
German
will,
right?
You buying
that?
Okay,
you're buying
that.
So,
Hitler's word
is law
because Hitler
is only
ever
expressing
the
authentic
innermost
desire
of the
German
volkish
will.
And if
you disagree
with that,
that doesn't
mean Hitler's
wrong.
That means
you're not
authentically
German.
You are
not
echt
volkish.
And being
found not
echt
volkish
in Germany
in the
30s was a
pretty bad
fucking thing
to happen
to you.
And so
there wasn't
a whole lot
of juridical
challenge to
this notion,
right?
Hitler is
running a
country where
literally
everything he
says becomes
legal or
illegal as
he says it,
right?
The literal
definition of
a dictator.
He dictates.
His diktats
are immediately
endowed with
the force of
law.
And yet,
a guy
like Tyson,
a generational
steel magnate,
or a guy
like Alfred
Krupp,
who you
could do
a whole
fucking
series of
episodes on,
the weapons
dealer,
and the very
close relationship
that they had
together,
you know,
Tyson supplied
the raw
materials,
Krupp turned
them into
weapons and
sold them
all over the
world.
Even Hitler,
at the level
of control
he ostensibly
exerted over
Nazi Germany
couldn't stop
people like
Tyson and
Krupp from
selling both
raw materials
and finished
weapons to
everyone on
every side
of the war.
He couldn't do
anything about
that.
That decision
happened on a
level that
superseded
fucking Hitler.
Hitler.
I mean,
this is,
we're talking
about a guy
who,
in order to
sort of
streamline,
you might
say,
German weapons
production in
the latter years
of World War
II,
declared something
called the
Lex Krupp,
which essentially
took Krupp from
being a more
or less standard
sort of plutocrat,
you know,
oligarch
corporation,
to being an
entity that
was very
nearly a
division of
the German
government in
which Herr Krupp's
word was law,
much like the
Führers for the
rest of Germany,
to do away with,
you know,
bureaucratic
squabbling and
red tape and so
forth, because we
need these goddamn
weapons now, so I'm
giving Krupp all the
power he could
possibly ask for.
And even then,
even right then,
as Hitler is
changing German
law in favor of
Alfred Krupp,
Krupp is selling
weapons to the
Soviets.
Krupp is selling
weapons to
everyone with the
money to buy
them.
And Krupp is
selling weapons
made out of
steel, in large
part, procured
from the Rur
Valley via his
friends over at
Tyson.
And so, we
have this very
burned-in world
historical image
of Hitler as,
you know, the
man who wielded
the most power
over a subject
population in
certainly modern
history and
possibly all of
history, right?
His word was
law.
And yet, and
fucking yet,
there was still
a level of
power above
him where
people like
Fritz Tyson
lived, where
people like
Alfred Krupp
lived, where
people like
various sort of
bankers and
financiers and
the world-spanning
almost, almost
unimaginably huge
apparatus of a
corporation like
Ige Farben lived,
where Hitler
couldn't tell them
what to do.
a level of
money men above
the dictates of
the Führer in
the nation that
elucidated the
Führer
principle.
And when you
understand this,
when you understand
that there is a
level, even in a
place like Nazi
Germany, at
which the men
with the real
power and the
real money from
all sides, come
together, make
their deals, and
shake fucking
hands, then you
begin to see the
Fourth Reich starting
to slide out
forward from
beneath the
third one.
So,
in keeping with
this subject
matter, where
can we possibly
go from there
except a reading
from Gravity's
Rainbow, which
is, among the
many other
reasons it's the
best English
language novel of,
I don't know, at
least the last 70
or 80 years, is
the book that
identifies the
emergence of the
Fourth Reich more
clearly than anything
else, right?
And this is a
scene, some of you
will know, in
which the
Russians and
Americans have
just led a
failed raid on
a Schwarzkommando
camp after the
war is over.
And because the
raid has fucked
up, Václav
Cichirin has to
hang out with
Major Marvy and
his friend, the
industrialist,
Clayton
Chicklets.
and Cichirin
starts to notice
that when they
talk about dividing
up the zone, i.e.
Germany, after
World War II, and
not just Germany,
you know, the
Greater Reich, all
German-controlled
territories, when
these guys talk
about how to
parcel that out,
they're not
talking about
governments, they're
not talking about
nation-states,
they're talking
about corporations,
they're talking
about who between
General Electric
and Siemens and
the various
members of the
Roosevelt Brain
Trust are going
to get which
part.
And Cichirin
starts to
remember the
FEMAN, VIMPA,
the guy who
explains molecular
chemistry to him
at one point,
among other
things.
And so listening
to Marvy and
Chicklets talk,
Chichirin begins
thinking this,
they fall into a
drawling juicer's
argument over the
ethnic background of
the ex-chairman of
GE, full of poison
and sluggish hate.
Chichirin listens
with only one ear.
An episode of
vertigo is creeping
up on him.
Didn't Neyresch,
under the drug,
mention a Siemens
representative at the
Eskeret meetings in
Nordhausen?
Yes.
And an IG man
too.
Didn't Carl Schmitz
of the IG sit on
Siemens' board of
directors?
Oh, VIMPA,
old V-man,
were you right?
Is your IG to be
the very model of
nations?
So it comes to
Chichirin,
here in the clearing
with these two fools
on either side of
him, among the
debris of some
numberless battery's
last stand,
cables paralyzed
where wench
operators levered
them to stillness,
beer bottles lying
exactly where they
were thrown by the
last men on the
last night,
everything testifying
so purely to the
shape of defeat,
of operational
death.
Say there.
It appears to be a
very large white
finger addressing
him.
Its fingernail is
beautifully manicured.
As it rotates for
him, it slowly
reveals a fingerprint
that might as well
be an aerial view
of the city
dactylic,
that city of the
future where every
soul is known,
and there is no
place to hide.
Right now,
joints moving with
soft hydraulic
sounds,
the finger is
calling Chichirin's
attention to a
rocket cartel,
a structure
cutting across
every agency,
human and paper,
that ever touched
it, even to
Russia.
Russia bought from
Krupp, didn't
she?
From Siemens?
From the IG?
Are there
arrangements Stalin
won't admit?
Or doesn't even
know about?
Oh, a state
begins to take
form in the
stateless German
night, a state
that spans oceans
and surface
politics, sovereign
as the international
or the church
of Rome, and
the rocket is
its soul.
I get
rocket in.
Circus bright,
poster reds and
yellows, rings
beyond counting,
all going at once,
the stately
finger twirls
among them all.
Chichirin is
certain.
Not so much on
outward evidence,
he is found moving
through the zone
as out of a
personal doom he
carries with him,
always to be held
at the edges of
revelations.
It happened first
with the Kirghiz
light, and his
only illumination
then was that fear
would always keep him
from going all the
way in.
He will never get
further than the
edge of this
meta cartel,
which has made
itself known
tonight, this
rocket state whose
borders he cannot
cross.
that rocket
state, that
meta cartel, is
exactly what I
have been talking
about the entire
time I have been
using the phrase
Fourth Reich.
That is precisely
it.
This is Chichirin
beginning to see it
slide out from under
the old Reich, the
same way the story
of someone like
Fritz Tyson or
Alfred Krupp will
show you the same
thing, that there
is a level above
the nearly
mythological evil
of all the Nazi
iconography that
we have been shown
and re-shown and
re-shown for the
last 80 years to
assure us that of
course we're not
like them.
Obviously we're not
like them.
We couldn't be as
evil as them because
we don't look like
this.
That's simply not
how we do things.
Sure, some of our
decisions may have
deleterious consequences
that maybe we saw
coming, maybe we
didn't.
Who knows?
But we're not
Nazis.
Look at the Nazis.
Look how they do
these rallies.
You ever see
anything in America
that looked like
that?
And if you go,
well, actually,
yeah, they go,
okay, okay.
I mean, obviously,
the exception proves
the rule, a phrase
that no one who uses
it has ever known
what it means.
But, you know,
it's a different thing
is what I'm saying.
Basically, it's a
vibes-based argument.
We don't have
Nazi-type vibes.
Whatever it is that
you think connects
us to them.
That Fourth Reich
above the vibes
in a thoroughly
vibeless zone
in a hermetically
sealed fucking
bank vault
and in the
C-suites
of every corporate
skyscraper on the
face of the
fucking planet,
that is what
Chichirin is
beginning to see
emerge.
And the rocket
on Pinchon's part
is a particularly
canny and
particularly,
how shall we say,
not over-determined,
that's not the word
I'm looking for,
but highly charged
locus
to which to pin
a number of ideas.
Because what is the
rocket in Gravity's
Rainbow, right?
You could spend,
I mean,
God,
hours and hours
and hours
just on that question.
But in a quick
schematic form,
the rocket is,
number one,
the use of
technology to
impersonate the
organic.
It is,
as Gustav the
composer says,
it is
Gesellschaft.
It is human
beings creating
systems that
they then treat
as though the
systems were
alive,
as though
technology has
a will unto
itself and
is not touched
by the will
of the people
who make it.
As if the
system is
purely rational,
purely self-interested,
but self-interested
in the sense of
efficiency and
effectiveness,
right?
And you build
a system complex
enough.
And tell me if
this reminds you
of a certain
modern reigning
political ideology.
Something like
liberalism,
newer,
like a new
liberalism,
you build a
system big enough
and that system
just takes over
on its own.
And nothing the
system does is
your fault.
It's an organic
entity.
All you're doing
is putting in the
numbers and seeing
what numbers get
spit back out,
right?
And that can't
make you a war
criminal,
can it?
If you're
forecasting stock
performance for,
say,
I don't know,
the quarter of
2024,
in which the
presidential election
is going to
happen,
and the
amount of
bombs and
guns and
airplanes and
drones that
you supply to
Israel right
now in order
to murder
people who
live in a
concentration
camp,
if you have
calculated that
those murders
will help you
during the
electoral season,
well,
that's not your
fault,
is it?
It's just
math.
It's just
something a
computer told
you.
And the
rocket is a
perfect emblem
of that,
of the way
that,
you know,
Gesellschaft,
system,
organization,
allows people
to expunge
themselves of
any fucking
sense of
responsibility.
And that
goes from
something very
literal,
like V2
rockets,
to something
like,
say,
the CIA,
or the
actions of
the federal
government in
general,
or the
White House
in particular,
or the
State Department,
or stock
brokers,
or fucking
bond traders,
all of whom
are convinced
that they're
just doing
what the
system tells
them to do.
It's not
personal.
There's no
reason to get
mad about it,
right?
It's just,
hey,
the rocket
said it
wants this,
and we gotta
do what the
rocket wants.
All right?
So that's
part one.
Part two
would be
the horror
of the
bleakest,
darkest
possible
human desire
that is
always,
and I mean
always,
without fucking
exception,
hiding at
the core
of that
feigned
belief in
absolute
impersonal
systematization.
You don't
get to that
kind of belief
without needing
to hide
something.
You do
not move
from human
life and
human
consciousness
as continued
for however
many tens
or hundreds
of thousands
of years
to the
modern human
mind,
which is
forever
insisting
that nothing
it does
is its
fault,
because it's
simply acting
as part of
a larger
aggregate,
which incidentally
the German
technical name
for the V2,
as Pinchon
mentions in
the book,
was the
aggregate fear,
which is
interesting on
a number of
levels because
aggregate is
exactly what a
rocket doesn't
do.
It disaggregates
things,
it pulls them
apart,
and also you
can't help but
notice that
A4,
aggregate fear,
sounds very
close to
aggregate fear,
which is,
I would say,
apropos.
you do not
get to this
sort of
social stasis
in which you
have managed
to convince
yourself that
nothing is
ever your
fault,
and you are
simply behaving
in accordance
with the needs
of the system
unless you
have something
fucking horrible
to hide,
unless you
have something
on your
conscience that
would shred
you to pieces
without that
delusion.
there was,
some of you
have probably
seen the
video someone
took of,
I don't even
know who the
woman is,
but some
corporate CEO
giving a talk
at a college
the other day,
and a student
stands up in
the middle of
it to challenge
her on her
company's
relationship with
Israel,
and the student
stands up and
says this woman's
name,
and the woman
just fucking
freaks,
like jumps out
of her chair
and screams,
and I cannot
help but think
watching this
woman,
I think her
name was
Julie Sweet,
I can't remember
the organization
or company
she works for,
but I can't
help but see
that reaction,
just someone
says your
name in the
audience,
and you
literally shriek
and pop out
of your chair
without thinking,
this is someone
who for years
and years
and years
has known
in the back
of her mind,
I'm gonna get
what's coming
to me,
someday,
out of a
crowd,
a faceless
person I
have never
seen before
is gonna say
my name,
and I'm gonna
look in that
direction,
and that'll be
the last thing
I ever see,
I won't even
have time to
react to the
bullet,
it'll just be
a blurred
face under
fucking,
you know,
indoor sodium
bulbs,
under cheap
track lighting,
an ugly
flicker,
that turns
this person
into a
cubist
montage,
where I
can't even
make out
anything
recognizable
as features,
and then
a pop,
and then
I'll be
dead,
this is
someone who
knows on
some level
that she
is a
devil,
and works
for devils,
and has
clearly been
carrying this
around with
her for a
long time,
if merely
saying her
name can
get her to
react like
she just
saw,
well,
her friend the
devil,
for instance,
as if the
devil had
literally appeared
to her and
said,
you know you're
going to hell,
right?
I mean we're
pretty clear
on that.
It is the
work of
this false
belief in
the pseudo
organic,
the systematized,
the organized,
the gazoshaft,
that is
necessary to
cover up
the incredibly
bleak core
of individual
human desire
at the heart
of something
like a
technology as
you know
in modern
terms,
relatively
uncomplicated
as a
V2 rocket
and then
you expand
that to
something like
I mean
Jesus Christ,
let's say
the mechanisms
underlying
cryptocurrency,
that would
be a pretty
good one
and Pinchon
of course
makes that
literal
in the
most horrifying
possible way
in that
the V2
that everybody
is looking
for,
the whole
book,
with the
secret
Schwarzkopf
the black
device in it
that no
one can
identify,
turns out
to be
a coffin
for his
living boy
slave
because
the only
way he can
fully consummate
his sexual
relationship
with death
is to put
his raped
boy pet
inside of
a rocket
and have
him die
in this
sort of
glorious
German
romantic
death
orgasm
Wagnerian
crucifixion.
It doesn't
get much
more effective
than that.
I'm sorry
if you haven't
read Gravity's
Rainbow yet
but trust me
over the course
of reading it
you'll forget
that part
and when it
shows up
at the end
again
you will
fucking
choke.
I remember
so well
one of the
many times
I read that
book
I think it
was the
third time
because I
was in a
fucking
Chipotle
in West
Lafayette
Indiana
which is
not a place
I would have
spent time
in any other
period of my
life
and read
that ending
the last
few pages
and had to
go outside
and just
walk in
circles in
the parking
lot
chain smoking
feeling like
the fucking
sky was gonna
fall in on
me for
good reason
because I
had just
seen something
black and
viscid and
sinuous and
intelligent in
in the most
basic sense of
the word
intelligence that
is having
its own
perceptive and
mental and
and reflexive
faculties that
I had just
I mean it
was like
fucking
opening the
hood of a
car that's
not working
and finding
a 10-foot
fucking
python in
there
this of
course
Pinchon
gets at
extremely
well
and though
the the
most prevalent
modern instances
of this
phenomenon we're
talking about
aren't perhaps
as visceral as
that you can
see exactly
the same thing
happening in
the relationship
between assholes
like Sam
Bankman Freed
and Sean
McElwee with
assholes like
the effective
altruist movement
right it's the
same fucking
thing because
what these
people at
their core
believe what
these people
would say if
they were honest
with themselves
if God compelled
them to make a
full accounting of
the contents of
their souls is
basically I found a
way to game the
system right I
realized that
there's this
emergent market
the thing
Westerners love
more than
anything else in
the world
emergent markets
they're what
what keeps the
globe spinning
and in this
emergent market I
realized that it's
it's basically all
bullshit it's a
Ponzi scheme
it's only actual
purposes money
laundering or
possibly if it
gets big enough
destabilizing national
currencies for
political purposes
and boy wait
till that shit
starts happening
wait until
people with
let's say
interesting
connections to
I don't know
American intelligence
agencies start
doing something
with Bitcoin
that suddenly
causes the
value of the
currency in a
country we're
thinking of
invading to
drop like a
fucking brick
because that's
on the way
the Bankman
Freeds the
McElwies would
say yeah I saw
this thing
I realized it
was a con
right but
all these
people were
taking it
seriously and
talking all
fucking
idealistically
about it and
I convinced
myself that if
I could con
the conners I
could actually
use it for
the ultimate
good of all
humankind
right because
what's important
isn't what I
do now what's
important isn't
the people I
hurt in my
lifetime or the
institutions that
I destroy or
the trust that
I erode or
the fucking
pension funds
and life savings
that I
absolutely vacate
no none of
that matters the
only thing that
matters is whether
I made enough
money to do
something good
for the race of
superhumans who
will be living
here in 300
years to which
God in this
interlocution
would say
fuck you
no you
fucking
didn't
no it's
exactly the
opposite of
that the
con was the
important part
the worship
of their own
cleverness was
the important
part the
feeling that
sure yeah a
lot of people
are getting
getting one
over on
somebody with
this entire
fucking Ponzi
scheme right
of course there
are people getting
cheated every day
there are people
cheating them
every day that's
common enough in
the quote-unquote
legitimate financial
sector right
that's nothing
new but in
something like
crypto what if
instead of
conning individual
clients I could
con the whole
thing I could
con crypto the
entire sector
unto itself now
that would be
something that
would prove I
was a real
fucking genius in
addition to giving
me access to
basically unlimited
money and all
that effective
altruism bullshit
yeah I'll tack
that on the end
as an excuse
for why my
attempt to
defraud not
just millions
of people out
of billions of
dollars but in
fact to defraud
an entire sector
of an economy
that I actually
helped build as
well no it's
not just about
me it's not just
because I need to
prove that I'm a
genius and not a
fucking loser and
and that no other
people aren't more
clever than me and
sure maybe they have
more money than me
now but they won't
always have more
money than me and
I'm gonna be
fucking powerful in
the way they can't
fucking imagine I'm
gonna buy the
fucking two-party
system and all
those cocksuckers in
Washington who laughed
at me are gonna be
licking my fucking
feet that's what it's
about effective
altruism comes
later speaking of
which CZ the
Binance guy turns
himself in for
money laundering and
agrees to pay 4.3
billion dollars worth
of fines that just
broke I don't know
if you've heard that
yet and you know
what I really don't
like about that guy
about CZ anyone who
knows anything knows
that I invented
Binance when I
borrowed money from
all of my four
boyfriends at the
same time right and
that was like 2006
so I don't want to
hear about this
this hashing
algorithmic bullshit
anyway I think you
see my point in
connecting someone
like Sam
Bagman-Fried to
someone like
Weissman like
Dominos Blicero and
the extent of evil
those two have
committed I mean
we're only just
getting the very
edge of the kind
of fallout that's
going to destroy
people's lives from
the entire fucking
FTX collapse are
are they that
dissimilar I don't
know we can't know
yet but I I
certainly wouldn't
I certainly wouldn't
call it impossible or
even implausible so
the rocket works right
as a locus for
this this false human
displacement this false
human abnegation of
self in the name of
system it also works
as a locus for the
way that system is
always founded on
some just unfathomably
grim aspect of human
libido but it works in
another way too it works
in the same way that
the stories of people
like Tyson and Krupp
work which is to say
that the rocket as an
undertaking the rocket
as an invention a
production item an
item for use
everything to do with
its history does not
actually make any
sense if you take
the idea of
nationalist economics
or indeed nationalism
you know writ large
seriously it doesn't
fucking work like that
you cannot build a V2
rocket and get all the
parts from one country
and all the design from
one country and all the
firing sites and all the
technicians and all the
designers no that's not
how shit works and in
Pinshan's sense when he's
talking about you know
the the Raketenstaat the
rocket cartel this is what
he's talking about he means
the same thing I mean by
fourth Reich that on the
level of the Raketenstaat
there is a global Reich of
capital that is
completely surpassing and
jumping over the local
Reich of you know
bullshit pseudo mythological
racist nationalism and
it seems fair to guess
that that is something a
guy like Hitler probably
didn't understand
Hitler there there's a
book I think I've
mentioned it before on the
show it's got some
incredibly off-key title
like Hitler's table talk
but it's conversations he
recorded during meals and
shit I think a lot of them
were recorded by Martin
Bormann and what is
remarkable about these
conversations is that
Hitler is incredibly
fucking stupid and
incredibly boring all he
talks about ever is Jews
no matter what anybody else
brings up you know whether
it's you know fucking the
results of the Olympics or
trouble on the Eastern
Front Hitler's like yeah yeah
yeah well I mean the Jews
you know obviously what are you
going to do this whole Jew
thing he he's a moron he is a
monomaniacal idiot and I don't
think it's particularly
coincidental that in his
position as this almost
shamanic idiot figure that he
has proved historically a great
cover a great front man for the
real interests of the fourth
Reich for the interests of the
kind of power that superseded him
from the beginning and superseded him
until the end the people he couldn't
stop from arming his enemies I
mean just just think of that in the
context not only of of the Nazi
state as a historical entity but of
the Nazi state as it has been
presented to us later in
mythological terms you know think of
you're seeing your first fucking
World War 2 documentaries at 12 or
whatever and then think of someone
explaining to you yeah actually there
were all these industrialists who uh
they aided in the rise of the Nazi
party and I mean they were Nazis too
they were pieces of shit but um
actually they were selling guns to
Russia they were selling uh steel to
pretty much everybody on the Allied
side that would confuse the shit out
of you as well it should because the
the image of again this Nazi mythos uh
so adeptly presented through media by
both the Nazis themselves and uh the the
citizens of the fourth Reich us
afterward and that's something I'm
going to talk about more the
presentation of this mythos has uh so
effectively singled out individuals and
the nature of that Führerprinzip uh you
know the dictatorial word is law thing as
the essence of the third Reich as the
thing you need to know and implicitly
then or sometimes very explicitly have
said so you know as long as where you are
right now doesn't look like that
everything's fine you're not a Nazi you
couldn't be a Nazi I mean are you wearing
one of their uniforms do you have a
swastika you got an eagle no then you're
good it's fine now uh once you graduate
from school what we're going to need you
to do is plug yourself into a system uh
that keeps the world horrible that
pollutes the water and air that makes
food that kills people it makes uh drugs
that don't work it makes uh illicit drugs
that kill everyone uh that passes laws
that fuck people over builds cars that
kill the people who drive them starts
wars kills everyone involved uh conduct a
whole secret global regime of uh
clandestine war and nobody knows how
many people that's killed uh we're never
gonna know uh run intelligence agencies
that uh are essentially now the global
SS and act with almost total impunity and
starving raping murdering essentially
anyone they uh take a fancy to and uh also
we're gonna need you to help out in whatever
little way you can with a genocide in real
time and be able to watch it on tv for the
first time and see it on the internet blow by
blow by blow and uh we're gonna kill something
like 17,000 people within about 45 days and
they're virtually all gonna be civilians
overwhelmingly children uh we're gonna blow up
80 mosques we're gonna crush 250 schools we're uh
going to take down uh an enormous amount of health
care facilities and hospitals and we're gonna lie to
your fucking face about why and how and what's
happening the entire time and we need you to lap that
shit up because you by then will understand that you're
just a cog in the machine you're a code you you are a a bit
of html you you're a fucking a code string in the algorithm
you you are a bit of formatting text right not even the body
just the formatting and there's nothing you could do
right and the uh the nature of the entire machine's operation
hey you're just the little guy in the brackets that says html head
it that's got nothing to do with you you are a strictly structural member
right in the sense of architecture you're just one of the beams holding
up one of the other beams and none of that is your fault
look then at the uh the multinational the transnational
uh the i would say supranational sort of capital involved in the v2 project
right and you will remember some of this from uh from gravity's rainbow that at
one point slothert finds out that the uh royal dutch shell
headquarters in amsterdam which you should look up if you've
never seen it it's a famous building is being used by the nazis as a radio
guidance transmitter to aim v2s at london at the same time as the british
division of shell has essentially been incorporated into the british
government and is giving its own dictates to the rest of the supposedly
representative body and uh yeah one of the main representatives for british
shell when it was incorporated into the government was a certain duncan sandus who
was winston churchill's son-in-law and then when the war is over
do v2s just vanish does the entire
vergelthungswaffen revenge weapon program disappear
no as a matter of fact uh as a matter of fact the nazis had designs for
rockets all the way up through the v9 v10 v12
they had a lot of stuff on paper and uh as with all the scrambling after the
war to pick up all the good ss officers all the good nazi intelligence people all
the good professional murderers all the good psychotic racists so we could send
them off to police our own racial ghettos our our own
ethno-religious colonies in imperial fucking subjugated states all over the world
for the next 80 years right in there of course rocket scientists
were a big ticket item and even better if you could get the designs of rockets
that uh the nazis had put down on paper but never had the chance to build
and one of those i believe it was the v10 or would have been the v10
was acquired by a company called boeing that you've probably heard of
and boeing when it acquired the v10 renamed it naturally uh they call it the
bow mark and the entire bow mark project is uh is marked by two interesting uh
synchronicities you could call them felicities number one it uh it was worked
on on the you know copywriting level the level of uh you know commercial copy for
for example selling this shit to the pentagon one of those copywriters was a
certain uh thomas ruggles pinch-on of oyster bay long island new york
recently graduated from cornell two years in the navy solid guy
the other was that the bow mark project also entailed something called
sage uh which is short for semi-automated ground environment
and sage was uh initially promoted as a computer network
that would uh link together all the missile bases in the united states
in case of an emergency say you know new york gets nuked or you know someone
fucking blows up the white house they didn't actually believe any of that was
gonna happen the whole soviet thing was bullshit from day one
but anyway this was the pretext right well sage actually served as a massive
repository of counterinsurgency and counterintelligence information uh doing
surveillance and you know document digs on anybody who was considered a
subversive and the basic technology that sage used was then exported to vietnam
during the war uh as part of the phoenix program it was called operation case white
and it was a linked computer network that uh was used to map the ho xi ming trail
in real time and to identify and murder we'll never know how many but probably 200 000 plus
vietnamese civilians uh on completely spurious charges of having been involved with the vietcong
but whether or not those people were really vc and it's kind of not the point the point was
to prove that one of these computer networks can function in the field in real time and with the
examples of sage and case white we brought that technology back home and it was rolled into a
project that's a project that's had a number of names but that you might know as arpanet and arpanet of
course uh became the exact program with which you are listening to me speak right now
directly from the third reich the missile design sure but directly through and to the fourth reich
in terms of the global designs that the missile not only enabled but in fact uh worked as cover for
stood in front of justified via completely fatuous imaginary military concerns so that we could get down to

For New York City, the world loves you, and retribution's surely due.
For the zealous who brought you hell, boy the heroes and Langley taught them well.
How to infiltrate joy
And do it to the world.
Can't we all just get along?
Like Amazon
And Raytheon
Coming together to make a drone
To bring us lunch
And kill the sons
In a city
Just a two for one
Holistic joy
To the world
To the world
To the world
Please stop resisting all the joy
In your world
Just a car full of celebrities
Singing about the joy
In your world
A string of bad luck
In this final turn
We gathered around
Watched our cities burn
Who could have possibly predicted this?
Said everyone
So we boldly venture into the black
Guided by a ground soundtrack
We'll liberate some foreign stars
And stick a flag
On the face of Mars
The beauty of starting again
Impatience, zero and original sin
The mantra rings across the land
How clever
Look at us
We've done it again
We're bringing joy
To hope
New worlds
You must admit
We've certainly got enough for
Bringing joy
To hope
New worlds
You must admit
We've certainly got enough for
Bringing joy
To hope
New worlds
In time these aliens
Will wander out the joy
We're bringing hope
New worlds
We're bringing hope
New worlds
New worlds
We're bringing joy
To your world
You'd better hope you don't have cheap bananas or ice
We're bringing joy
To your world
You'd better hope you don't have dead dinosaurs
We're bringing joy
To your world
You'd better hope you don't have big plans or ice will bring in
You'd better hope you don't have big plans or ice will bring in
You'd better hope you don't have big plans or ice will bring in
You'd better hope you don't have big plans or ice will bring in
