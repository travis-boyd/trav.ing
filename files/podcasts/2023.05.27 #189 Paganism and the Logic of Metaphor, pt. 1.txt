Now I wonder, Mr. Murphy, if you're familiar with the works of a certain Howard Phillips
Lovecraft, oh don't be put off by the name, he has some most illuminating things to say.
You see, what Mr. Lovecraft understands is that in our age, men are so far from God that
the fear is no longer that God does not exist, oh no, that would be a blessing.
The fear is that God does exist because man looks at the carnage around him and realizes
if a God has decreed this bloodshed, this chaos and catastrophe, then that God must be so overwhelmingly,
infinitely alien as to become incomprehensible, sitting up there all day on his impregnable
perch.
There once, once man lived alongside the gods.
Once he could see the gods every place he went and everything he did.
But that day has passed us by through 6,000 years of blood mist.
And not a single man alive on this earth can possibly return to it.
Except me, I know like exactly how to do that.
I could probably explain it in like an hour if you want to hear that.
Ah, yes, alas, alas, Mr. Murphy.
Yes, but alas, alas, Mr. Murphy, we must turn ourselves away from these high-minded pursuits
and rededicate ourselves to the miserable groveling that earns us our daily crust of bread.
Into promo code LeeHarveyOswald at Bluetooth.com, Mr. Murphy.
You know, I haven't gotten to the trouble with that.
I really hope, I don't know what the age demographic of this show is really.
I don't know if I even could know that.
But I really hope it's made up of at least a few people who remember who John Hurt was.
Because if you don't know who John Hurt is, none of that whole stupid fucking intro is going to make any sense.
Except for the subject matter, which is unusually enough for a stupid fucking intro.
More or less what I'm going to talk about.
And it starts here, friends.
After talking about Bowie and The Next Day, and particularly the song The Stars Are Out Tonight,
in the last episode, I mentioned kind of offhandedly that I have a whole theory of paganism
and didn't have time to get into it then.
And then I got a very surprising number of messages saying,
Oh, you got to do the pagan thing. Tell us about the pagan thing.
So I'm going to at least start to do that.
Because it's, as you might imagine, for something that goes back, I don't know, a couple hundred thousand years.
Last I knew, the oldest confirmed thing as being a religious artifact was something like 200,000 years old.
And that, of course, is not even beginning to touch the things that are religious artifacts.
We just don't recognize that.
Right?
So, kind of a lot to cover on the subject.
And I should say, too, at the outset, pagan is a very stupid word.
Not least because pagan has been used for centuries, possibly even millennia,
to demonize anyone who falls outside of the central matrix of the Abrahamic religions.
It's just that there is no better catch-all than pagan.
Because a lot of the time, I'm going to be talking about something you could describe as being akin to animism.
But it's not all animism.
It's not that simple.
And I do think even the word animism kind of short-sells what is going on here.
So let me try to run it backwards a little bit and try to get back to the point where I would start this thing.
Talking about the Bowie song.
The stars are out tonight.
And the, not equation per se, but the close identification between the idea of celebrity and not Godhead in a monotheist sense,
but God's plural.
It's also a bugbear of mine that I think polytheism is a very stupid word, too,
because polytheism simply sounds like it's monotheism but with more gods.
And that's not what it is.
That's not how it works.
This song, it draws that connection between what we, sure, call them gods.
And celebrity.
And I think I got through that pretty thoroughly last time.
But despite the outwardly pagan nature of it, there is also a profoundly medieval thing going on.
But, you know, the explicit references, the things like, you know, waiting for the first move,
satyrs and their child wives, waiting for the last mood, soaking up our primitive world,
you know, very obviously a proto-Christian reference.
But that idea of a figure like a satyr who is not a god, although some of them were, you know, closely associated with gods,
but still, these are not godly beings.
The celebrity in that sense occupies the same sort of super stratum.
This is a thing which occupies a higher level of reality than we do, right?
That is normal, or rather, more normal and more real than we are.
Whatever we think normalcy or reality is, that's where they actually live.
And we perform our own horrible, grotesque self-parodies of what we wish reality was
because we are not sacred or enlightened or lucky enough to be there.
You know, I'm hardly the first person to say this,
but that's a big part of the whole Slavoj Zizek thesis that movies are real, the audiences are fake.
Because the movie instills in the audience's mind what reality is supposed to be,
and then the audience goes back to the rest of his life,
and to the greatest extent possible, which is usually not very great,
tries to enact this sense of reality that it has received from the movie.
You know, the movie is not an imitation of life.
Life is an imitation of the movie,
and I don't just mean that in the kind of cheap Oscar Wilde sense, right?
Oh, life imitating art.
No, no, no.
What I mean is, aside from the plot, aside from the theme,
aside from anything explicit or paraphrasable,
every detail of something like a fucking movie gets inside your brain
and serves as a kind of a connotative device
to alert you to when you're about to do something quote-unquote real.
You know, I mean, things that you would never focus on consciously,
fucking architecture, lighting, weather, the rhythm of people speaking,
whether or not the sort of English, let's just say it's English language,
whether or not the sort of English they're speaking
is a sort of English that you ever hear in your day-to-day life.
You know, there was that whole weird period in the 70s
where every actor, for some reason, talked like they were Italian.
Even fucking Robert Duvall.
He was like a weird combination of Italian and, like, Georgian.
The whole kind of, like, Robert Duvall, you gotta drive the track slow.
You know, I don't know anyone who talks like that.
And yet, because that was the dominant sort of linguistic paradigm
for a while in the whole, you know, golden age of new Hollywood,
that becomes, in the viewer's mind, more real.
More real than anything else.
The same way that if you have ever done any work on music
in the recording, mixing, engineering, production thing,
you will learn very, very quickly
that all of the sounds of music you have ever heard,
with the possible exception of a few live things,
that's not what it actually sounds like
when you do that in the room.
You will record, you know, someone playing a drum kit
and think, yeah, okay, it sounded good.
We got the performance.
You did it right.
And then go back, and unless you have, you know,
the nice microphones and rack mount compressors
and channel strips and shit,
you're gonna hear it back and think,
those aren't drums.
That sounds fake.
That sounds like, you know,
some kid playing in his mom's basement,
which, you know, it is.
That's kind of the point.
But the insanely hypertrophied idea of a drum sound
that you have gotten from years and years and years
of, you know, reverb-gated snare drums
on fucking first Peter Gabriel
and then Phil Collins and Def Leppard
and all that horrible shit,
that has come to supplant, by far,
the notion of reality in your mind.
And most of us, I think, consciously or not,
do not then adjust our notions of reality
to be more in accord with what is actually going on around us.
We live in a profound, eerie, haunted disaffection
with the fact that our lives aren't real in that sense.
We can't go to where reality is.
And, of course, that's, you know,
the big part of the whole thesis
of the iconosphere and Oswald
and things that I've now been talking about
for five years,
things that I've been thinking about
for, Christ, probably 15 years.
There's all that going on
in The Stars Are Out Tonight, right?
But there is also, I think,
a link between the pagan and the medieval in there,
which is going to be a very important thing
because those two are thick as thieves, boy.
Looking at a song like that
and then looking around me at the way,
you know, a lot of people I know spend their lives,
it seems to me that we are in a profoundly
sort of neo-medieval period.
I guess you might call it like a fractal medieval period.
And I'm sure I'm not the first person
to make this observation.
I have probably heard someone else make it
and already forgotten.
But there is a sense, I think,
at least here, you know, in America,
in the West,
of the pretenses and the premises
and the, you know,
implicit promises of the Enlightenment
being foreclosed upon.
You know, you get Enlightenment
right up till about
fucking Auschwitz and the atomic bomb.
And then after that,
it's pretty fucking hard to pretend
that American history is the story
of human beings becoming more and more rational
until progress finally lands us
in a world of no real problems.
No one can buy that shit anymore.
And incidentally,
and this is a thing that'll come up later
when I get to the more specifically pagan part,
if you have never read Adorno,
Theodore Adorno,
I would really highly recommend a book
that he wrote with Max Horkheimer
that is called
The Dialectic of Enlightenment.
It's not a difficult read.
It's not a, you know,
a thousand page,
very technical tome
about Hegelian metaphysics
or what the fuck ever.
It's, anybody could read it
without much special background.
And the whole thrust of the book
is essentially that,
that the Enlightenment
begins with the idea
that humanity through reason
can master nature,
that the world can be turned
into whatever we wish it were
by the sublime powers
of the human mind.
And you get a few centuries of that
and it ends in fucking Hiroshima.
It ends in not only the Third Reich,
but the fourth one.
A really good book
tracing the way
the Enlightenment
kind of ate itself alive.
So now that we are
in what I personally
would call a post-Enlightenment period,
it's not that we're going forward
into anything.
I think it's that we're going back
in a different way.
Back into a kind of medieval cosmology.
Because along with all that
Enlightenment bullshit,
went the idea
that an individual human life
is one of progress.
That you are always moving
onward and upward
and wherever you are now
is the place you're supposed to be.
And all that,
everything happens for a reason,
bullshit.
All my losses was lessons.
You know, all that.
Oh yeah, actually I had to get
fucking hit by a car.
So I would eventually realize
how much I love making buttons
or what the fuck ever.
There is a collapse of that,
I think, on a broad scale
and a return to a much more
medieval self-conception
in which people not only realize
in a factual or economic
or logistical sense,
but also in an inward sense
that they have been
in most cases condemned
and in a few cases,
you know,
elected, blessed
to occupy a certain role
in a socioeconomic system
that they can't really do anything about.
they are, you know,
a bee in the hive
and the hive is not run by other bees.
It's run by an overseer
who will kill them.
And there, you know,
you can sort of shift around
and get any number of equally shitty jobs
and live in equally shitty places
and have equally shitty health
and have equally shitty fucking insurance
or non-insurance
and be in equally shitty amounts of debt.
But there's no real upward movement.
Down is the only way.
One now conceives of oneself
as a more fixed point
in the sort of social constellation, right?
Now, lots of people, of course,
want to believe that's not true.
It used to really make me angry
when people of my generation
and a little bit younger
would say, you know,
something good would happen to them
and would say,
oh, it was fucking destined.
This is fate and destiny.
I was born to do this.
This is how the world is supposed to go.
Everything happens for a reason.
And, I mean, to be quite honest,
it still does piss me off.
But I feel a little less scornful
toward it than I used to
because I've heard it so many times
from so many people
who, believe me,
did not have fate and destiny
on their side
that I began to realize,
oh, they're reverting to this.
They're reverting to the medieval
because everything since the medieval
in their lives
and in the lives of probably
almost all the people they know
has turned out to be
a complete fucking lie.
And so instead of this idea of,
you know,
social stratification,
but upward mobility,
always learning more,
always knowing better,
you know, tomorrow
I will understand more than I did today
and on and on and on
until you fucking die.
that's gone.
And I think people are
conceiving of themselves
more as sort of
trapped within the crystallization
of a given order.
And it's strange,
you know,
in theory,
right,
the present era
gives you more access
to more information
is a very dubious word,
more media
than you've ever seen before,
right?
You can find more people
saying more shit
than anybody else
in the history of the world.
And this is one of the,
the, you know,
subordinate promises
of the enlightenment,
right?
That instead of any one
central hierarchical
nexus of control
that tells you what to think
about everything
all of the time,
we are going to have
a plurality,
a multivocity.
We are going to have,
you know,
what ultimately always
comes down to
the self-correcting mechanism
of the fucking free market.
Because if people believe
in nothing else,
they at least used
to believe in that.
Which is funny,
incidentally,
because if you actually
read the Adam Smith shit
about the invisible hand
of the market,
that's,
that's not what he's saying
at all.
That's completely
not the point.
But,
anyway,
the,
the,
the idea was
that you would have
as many sources
of information
as possible
and the good ones
would outlast
the bad ones
and you would
cull all the good
information
and become,
you know,
on any,
any given day,
the best informed
human being
who has ever lived.
And that is exactly
what didn't happen.
what happened
was that the,
the omnipresent
overload
of information
makes people
behave
precisely
the other way around.
Instead of trying
to
consume
everything
because,
A,
that's impossible
and,
B,
a lot of it is shit
you don't really
want to hear,
you don't really
want to believe.
Uh,
instead of that,
people have realized,
hey,
as long as there is
a functional infinity
of anyone saying
anything,
right,
as long as I can find
any opinion,
any fucking view
offered as if it
were serious,
I can also find
infinitely more
of that.
Whatever bullshit
I like already,
there's always
going to be more.
There's more than I could
possibly be aware of.
I think,
um,
you see very much
the same thing
in the awful way
the music industry
is trending
at the moment.
That,
the music industry
has always been
fucking horrible.
But,
um,
there's a story
I think of
all the time
about Frank Zappa
uh,
getting his,
his first record deal.
And,
he said,
1965
was the only year
in human history
I could have
gotten a record deal
because,
uh,
Tom Wilson,
who was,
uh,
Bob Dylan's producer
at the time,
walked into
a Zappa show
with the Mothers
of Invention
and they were
killing some time
by playing
a 12-bar blues.
and Tom Wilson
thought,
oh man,
white kids
playing blues,
people love
this bullshit.
Uh,
and then
when he finally
brought them
into the studio,
he was,
um,
a bit nonplussed
at the kind
of thing
they actually
did.
But,
the point
that Zappa
was making
was that
in those days,
however horrifically
corrupt
and violent
and mobbed
up
the record
industry was,
at least
the people
at the top
were old
men
who knew
they didn't
know what
the fuck
they were
talking about.
The people
with the money,
the people
who signed
the deals
were old
men
whose,
whose,
uh,
attitude
toward pretty
much,
you know,
all music
after the music
of their youth
was,
I don't know,
I,
I don't get
this bullshit.
I,
I don't fucking
understand.
The kids
like it,
okay?
You take a
chance on it,
the kids
like it,
who knows,
fucking Christ.
That's actually
better than
how it is
now,
because now,
and this is
something you
can really,
really see,
uh,
developing in
the 70s.
If,
if you've
never read
Don DeLillo's
book,
Great Jones
Street,
it's a
beautiful example
of this.
It's one of the
funniest things
he ever wrote.
Uh,
anyway,
I won't go too
far into that,
but the point
is,
uh,
after the kind
of,
you know,
hippie boom
counterculture
60s shit,
the record labels,
the management
agencies,
all of a sudden
started being run
by young people
who thought
they were cool.
Young people
who,
essentially,
for the modern
era,
invented the
idea of
the tastemaker.
That,
oh,
my job isn't
actually,
you know,
signing bands
that will make
records.
My job is
having correct
opinions.
That's what I do.
I'm an expert
at opinions.
And,
um,
it,
it,
it has enabled
this horrifying
situation
in which,
um,
fucking,
uh,
A&R men,
artists and
repertoire,
the,
the guys who
basically serve
as go-betweens,
uh,
for a,
a record label
to an artist,
they now conceive
of themselves
as artists.
They conceive
of their A&R
careers
as artistic
careers,
and they
fully consider
themselves,
uh,
not just
partial contributors,
but in fact,
the most important
contributors to
anything about
any record
they,
you know,
fucking breathed
on that was
successful.
There are
just infinite
stories about
some fucking
agent or
management company
signing somebody,
giving them just
a little bit of
money,
enough to live on,
doing no work
on their fucking
behalf at all,
not putting their
music in anybody's
hands,
not talking to
anyone they know,
not getting gigs
lined up,
and then if,
if that client
of theirs should
happen to have
a big hit,
basically on his
or her own
steam,
doing all the
work,
uh,
himself or
herself,
then they take
credit for it,
and they get
lauded by the
industry as,
you know,
the premier
tastemakers of
their day.
It's a really
fucking foul
world.
I,
I don't know if
it's just because
I have more
exposure to it,
but,
uh,
I think the music
industry pisses me
off even more
than,
than,
movies and
publishing.
Anyway,
the reason I say
this in this
particular context
about,
um,
deluge of
information leading
to ignorance
rather,
rather than
knowledge,
is that you look
at something like
Spotify,
right?
And,
I am dating
myself here,
I am positively
sure of it,
but,
but when I was
growing up
and starting
to get
seriously
into music
history and
finding out
what band
influenced that
band,
and here's
this record
that I've
heard a million
people talk
about,
I've never
heard,
and wait,
this guy
went on to
be in that
thing.
The way you
did that
was by,
uh,
reading
fucking books,
reading
occasionally
one of the
more serious
music magazines,
and then
going to
like,
used CD
shops,
and trying
to find
shit,
and if you
got really
lucky,
the record
might still
be in print
on some
small label,
and you
could,
you know,
mail them
$15,
and they'd
send a copy
to you.
Um,
there was a
very active,
and for me,
one of the
most exciting
parts about it,
a very
continuous
sense of
discovery.
I was always
looking to
find out the
wellsprings of
the stuff I
loved already,
and also to
find stuff for
which my
favorite music
was in turn
the wellspring.
I wanted to
see that whole
evolutionary
pattern,
and there are
probably a few
people like that
out there,
but by and
large,
that way of
doing things
is fucking
gone,
because the
record labels,
the publishing
companies,
that is music
publishing,
not book,
realized,
hey,
we can,
um,
we can just
cut a gigantic
deal with
someone like
Spotify to
give them
rights to
stream,
you know,
everything we've
got under
contract,
and essentially
cut out the
middleman,
who in this
case is the
person who
made the
fucking song,
right?
And if you
have a setup
like that,
in which,
not the
entirety of
recorded music,
it's amazing
what isn't on
Spotify,
but a
whole lot
of it,
enough for
most people.
If that is
available for
a, you know,
whatever dollar
per month
subscription,
and especially
if it is
using an
algorithm to
try to
predict things
you're going
to like based
on your past
choices,
that's kind
of it.
That's the
end of music
history to me.
Maybe music
history will
start over again
at some point,
maybe it's
only dead
for now,
but right
now I would
say it's
pretty fucking
dead.
Because just
as with,
you know,
some fucking
fringe political
crank who
realizes that,
hey, whatever
his special
obsessive pet
issue is,
there are now
more articles
about it on
the internet
than he could
possibly read
for the rest
of his life,
so he never
needs to read
anything else.
He can just
do that till
he dies.
In the same
way, you
play fucking
10 songs
on Spotify
and then for
the rest of
your goddamn
life, they
will give you
a continuous
stream of
music that
basically sounds
like those
10 songs.
That didn't
used to be
possible and
not just
because of
the streaming
aspect, the
influence of
the internet,
not just
because of
the algorithmic
targeting and
test marketing.
No, there
didn't used to
be that many
records.
There just
hadn't been
that many
made.
And when we
look back at
60s and 70s
stuff and
wonder, why
does this still
sound so vital
and real and
edgy and
really fucking
going for it,
head down
charging?
And yet, this
thing from
2012, it
sort of sounds
the same, it
sort of got the
same mood, but
nothing about it
is interesting or
exciting to me.
That is a huge
part of it.
because you go
back to the
birth of modern
pop music in
the 60s, you
know what
modern pop
musicians weren't
listening to
was modern
pop because
there wasn't
any, because
they were making
it up.
Of course, once
they got famous,
they ended up
influencing each
other, but
those people, and
the Beatles are
the most obvious
example, they
didn't become the
Beatles by hearing
some shit that
sounded like the
Beatles and
then trying to
replicate it.
They devoured
all the music
they could and
learned as deeply
as possible how
all of it worked
and what you
could do with it
and how you
could transmute it
into something
else.
And, you know,
over about six
years of that,
they created the
basis for
essentially all
Western popular
music since then.
Well, now, if
you want to start
a shitty rock
band, and who
doesn't?
We love being in
shitty rock
bands.
You can say, I
want my band to
sound like X.
And it could be
anything from, well,
actually the band
X, let's just
say, or fucking,
you know, Joy
Division or Jim
Thurwell or Steve
Albini or what the
fuck ever, too.
I don't know.
I'm sure there are
people out there who
are still fans of
Linkin Park.
Some shit like
Linkin Park, let's
say.
In the olden
days, when I
was only, let's
see, how old was
I back then?
I guess I was
about 44,000 years
old at the time.
You started a band
with a certain
idea of a certain
kind of sound in
mind.
And then you
worked and you
learned stuff and
things changed.
and hopefully
at some point
you made something
interesting via
the, not
amalgamation, but
the sort of, you
know, a limbic
sizzle of all the
stuff you'd ever
heard.
Now you don't
need to do that
because now there
is enough bullshit
that sounds like
Linkin Park for
you to listen to
nothing other than
that for your
entire goddamn
life.
life.
And I think
this is, for
me, a good
encapsulation of
what I would
call sort of the
re-medievalization
of Western
life.
That rather
than enforcing
ignorance by
trying to take
information away,
and this is a
point Felix from
Chapo has made a
number of times,
they are instead
enforcing ignorance
by giving you more
information than you
could possibly
handle, right,
and then forcing
you to choose just
to listen to this
thing or that
thing.
And the
enlightenment
promise of
movement and
progress and, you
know, gradual
elevation, that
disappears.
And instead, what
we have are people
who, it's hard to
say, of course, in
any question of
social construction,
how much people
want this because
they want it, and
how much people want
this because they're
told to want it, and
it's what's
available.
people, but
however, however it
goes, we have now
attained a state of
being in which the
sort of, you know, the
medieval fucking ant
colony model is what we
aspire to.
We spend our entire
fucking lives trying to
find our own little
hexagon in the beehive,
to live there forever and
ever, and have people
praise us for having so
beautifully distilled
what it means to be a
fucking whatever.
We are desperate to
get ourselves categorized,
and this is something I've
talked about really on
and off the whole length
of this show, what I
have called in academic
papers that no one will
ever read, and you
probably shouldn't,
honestly, identity
capital.
That identity in
itself, it is no
longer just a means
to sell things.
It's no longer just a
means to affiliate
oneself with the kind
of clientele that you
would like to buy your
bullshit, right?
It is now a form of
capital unto itself.
You can sell it raw and
un-fucking-cut, except of
course that there is no
such thing as raw and
uncut because somewhere or
other, it's always being
presented to you by a
billion-dollar corporation,
whether that's, you know,
some assholes like
Metallica's record label or
whatever, or it's some,
you know, starving little
band from Columbus, Ohio,
that only gets to you via
something like Spotify.
the sort of, the medieval
constellative, I guess would
be the word, the medieval
social arrangement in which
you were born, you have a
life, you have a role, it's
pretty much not going to
change, you're stuck there,
good luck.
That was something people to
various degrees and in
various ways tried to
wriggle out of for, you
know, what do you want to
call it, 600 years,
something like that, and
now with the complete
collapse of all the
promises of those 600
years, people are
desperate to get back
into that hierarchy.
They'd like to be at the
top of the hierarchy, of
course, who wouldn't, but
what they want more than
anything else is to have a
place, to have a station,
to know where they are
and thus who they are.
And this, of course, is, I
mean, married at the
fucking hip with the
economics of, you know,
people, there's certain
words for me that it's just
hard to use because you
hear them so often that
they, you know, the meaning
drains out.
Neoliberalism, that word
does mean a real thing,
but now people just throw it
fucking anywhere.
You know, late capitalism,
again, it means a real
thing, but it's been
fucking pressed dry, and
now it's flopping around
like a fish carcass on the
deck.
And the phrase that has
been occurring to me
lately is a post-productive
capitalism, which is to
say capitalism in which the
driving engine of the
economy is no longer
actually making anything.
It's essentially just
moving money around.
It is fucking three-card
Monty capitalism.
It is, you know,
neath the bougie, the
thimble rigger, slyly
rolls a pea, Scott Walker
capitalism.
It's a singer, not the
governor.
In the age of capital that
no longer breeds anything
but more capital, we are so
fucking immiserated.
We have so few actual
prospects for even a
baseline decent life.
And bear in mind, I am a
white man in America
saying this.
I got in many ways about as
lucky as you fucking could
in terms of how and where
and as what I was born.
And still, I see this
everywhere.
You know, I was fucking
just helplessly broke for
my entire life until about
two years ago.
Thank you, Truanon, by the
way.
And I really truly thought
this is what it's going to
be.
I'm just going to, I'm
going to keep being stone
fucking broke until either
I get a fatal disease
because I can't do anything
about it or I shoot myself
in the mouth and that's
going to be it.
And I got astonishingly
lucky, which I will never
stop being grateful for
either to to them or to
you listening to this.
But the idea that there was
any actual possibility
anywhere for me, the
the idea that I could be
anything but what I was
just jammed into this
fucking, you know, square
hole of, yeah, frankly,
you're kind of fucked up and
weird and your brain doesn't
really work right.
And also your your flesh
doesn't really work right.
And it's not it's not really
turning a profit for anybody,
which is sort of our main
thing.
So we're going to allow you
to kick around at the very
margins of society until
you die in some more or less
convenient way.
that's fully what I expected.
And in some ways still is
fully what I expect.
And there is an incredible
bleakness to the way that we
we have so little actual
influence.
We have so little power in the
the beneficent sense of the word
power that is power to make
things better that we not
only would settle for, but
in fact, desperately grasp
after just being told which
cell to get into.
Like, OK, OK, OK, no, no
more fucking running around in
the cafeteria, no more
dicking around in woodshop
back in your cells.
And here's your name.
And here's what you're supposed
to fucking be.
And step out of line.
You'll see what happens.
And that to me is a very
distinct form of, you know,
neo-medievalism, a point at
which what I'm calling
post-productive capitalism
transitions back, does the
kind of Mobius strip loop back
with medievalism.
And it is, of course, anything
but coincidental that on the
macro scale, the economy of the
United States and of many other
nations, some of which
never really stopped doing
this because they're, you
know, our fucking labor or
resource colonies, anything
but a mistake that
increasingly everything is
owned by a very small group
of people who have unlimited
power to deny you the ability
to survive.
And whether or not this is
actually going to happen in
terms of like political
breakup, in terms of, you know,
the actual rearrangement of the
structure of the American
state, I have no idea if this
will happen.
But in effective terms, I think
it's pretty clear that unless
something changes real fucking
quick, we are essentially going
to live in a sort of feudal order
that every major region of the
United States will have a few
billionaires who control it, who are
responsible for doling out all the
jobs and money that, you know,
anybody in that region can ever
possess.
And they will own outright the
entire political system in that
region and will have, you know, a
couple hundred billionaires maybe
who are the real archons of the
country.
And I mean archon both in the
political sense and in the sense
of like a demieurgic Gnostic
devil, because that is what they
are.
The idea of federal regulation,
the idea that what the Senate says
has anything to do with your
fucking life is for most people, I
think, just kind of crumble away,
kind of going to crumble away, I
should say.
And I think it's very much in the
process of doing that now.
I think a lot of people are looking
at the the present legislature in
the U.S., for instance, and the
possibility of, you know, whatever
candidate in the next presidential
election.
And I think their reaction, and I can't
even really disagree in some ways, is
that, you know, the best case scenario
is actually that these people do
nothing.
The best thing that could happen to
us is that the legislative part of
the federal government is just
gridlocked until it dies.
Because if it's not gridlocked until
it dies, it is going to be the hard
right introducing completely fucking
insane laws.
And then the center right, which is to
say the Democrats, talking about how
unfair and evil and uncivil and not
parliamentarian all of this bullshit is,
and then caving to every demand.
People love to talk about compromise and
bipartisanship.
What a horrible fucking word.
And I have always thought, even since I
was a kid, if I vote for you, I'm not
voting for you to then go compromise with
someone I hate.
That's not, that's, that's, if that's the
case, why am I voting at all?
And that turned out to be a pretty good
question.
Why am I voting at all?
And, um, I think the, it's not simply the,
you know, question of institutional
gridlock.
It is also the fact that the most powerful
elements in the legislature, in the
judiciary, in many ways, in the executive,
even though it's technically a Democrat
right now, what they want is devolution
of powers.
What they want is to become a kind of a
game show, basically.
A husk.
The shed skin of what used to be fucking
politics.
And we can all keep watching that and
acting like it matters.
And meanwhile, at the state level, the
governor will be able to decide whether a
woman has autonomy over her own body.
And don't forget, we change governors all
the time.
So it could change every few years.
It's going to be a fucking guessing game
from this point onward.
And if you've ever been around a
governor, I have a couple times.
You will know that as just loathsome and
reptilian as senators or presidents are,
governors are that too.
But they're also dumber than pig shit.
There is nothing.
There is nothing.
There is nothing I would trust to one of
these people.
There is no one I would rather trust less than
these people.
And yet, this seems to be the direction of
things.
This is the the natural devolution of the
neo-medieval of the postproductive that we
will dissolve into a semi-attached network of
of of basically regional fiefdoms.
And whoever your local billionaire is, get ready to
do whatever the fuck he wants, because whatever
government there is, he's going to own it.
And this is all medieval in itself.
And the next thing I'm going to get into eventually is
tracing from the medieval back to the pagan as they both
appear in Bowie's song, because there is a lot to go
through there.
And and beyond that, into I think, again, the word pagan is
stupid, but the the nature of, you know, like Rambo said,
l'alchemy du verbe, the nature of the alchemy of language at
the root of both all human language, all human knowing and at
the root of the way paganism actually worked.
So far as I can tell, I wasn't there, obviously, but I have
read as much as I could about and from the people who were
there.
And I think it is terribly misunderstood.
So that'll be the next thing we get into.
But in this moment, in talking about the medievalization of
of of American of Western culture and its specific relationship
to paganism, I think there is something very interesting going
on in the idea.
I guess I would call this sort of the what would the word be the
vulgar conception of paganism that it's about, you know, appealing
to gods.
It's about, you know, finding the correct God for the correct
question and then making a sacrifice, begging her, him,
whatever.
You know, you get your little accountant's visor on and go
through the list and see who's the who's the God of my dick
not working.
Oh, Priapus.
OK, so I'm going to need to find a I don't know, a goat or
something.
Cut that motherfucker's throat and then burn him perhaps in a
field with some of my other friends whose dicks don't work and
we will be on our way.
No, that's a really dumb, reductive, condescending idea of what
paganism is, was.
I think in large part because all of our thinking about all of
this and this goes back to the idea of never having to hear
another opinion.
You don't want to never having to hear any music that doesn't
already sound like the music you like.
The same thing historically happens in terms of religion, in
terms of theology, in terms of, you know, in in the
specifically religious senses of the world, word, metaphysics,
cosmology, whatever.
We now see all of that backward through the lens of thousands of
years of monotheism.
Polytheism and we are thus unable to think of basically anyone
believing in anything that's not the way we believe in it, just
more.
We think of this is part of why I said earlier I don't like the
word polytheism.
We're sort of taught to think of that is like, okay, now imagine,
okay, you're a Christian, right?
And you got your God and you pray and you ask God to do things and
often.
In fact, most of the time he doesn't.
Not his fault.
Maybe your fault.
Maybe, maybe look into that, you know?
And then there are some weird primitive people halfway around the
world who have got a whole bunch of gods and they're always asking
them for stuff.
It, no, complete bullshit.
That, that is not how it is at all.
And, um, this will be something I, I will address more in tracing that arc
back to the pagan.
But, uh, for as much as I hate the Catholic church and I don't hate many
things more than the Catholic church, I grew up under that son of a bitch,
John Paul III.
And then in a way that still honestly kind of impresses me, he died and the
Vatican flat out said, you know what we're going to do?
You know who we're giving you next?
A literal gay Nazi.
Fucking deal with it.
I mean, it's sort of amazing.
The, the chutzpah is, is measurable there.
Um, I have pretty much limitless rage and grief toward the Catholic church,
but I do appreciate that Catholicism, even if it doesn't want to, has a
connection to the pre-Christian world, uh, in a way that most forms of
Protestantism don't.
And frankly, and this is not like a judgmental thing either.
I'm not ranking religions over here, but I don't think most forms of
Protestantism are really religions.
Not, not, not really.
There's something else.
Um, Catholicism for its essentially infinite amount of flaws.
Uh, I believe about 2000 more of which were just discovered in the Chicago
archdiocese.
Uh, it has a connection to the pre-Christian world in a way that most of the
most other, at least American Christianity doesn't.
And Catholicism, if you pursue it back far enough, at root is essentially, okay, we've
got this kind of creation historical framework of Judaism sitting there ready for anyone to
take.
We're going to smuggle as much pagan shit into that as we can to make it more palatable,
more comprehensible to, uh, a world full of people who find Judaism baffling.
Uh, we're, we're going to paganize Judaism and in that way, spread it by making a religion
that recycles so many of the basic, you know, metaphysical, uh, religious mythological cycles.
You know, the, the real root myths that, uh, that anyone can join it.
Anyone can understand it.
I think it was Nietzsche who said that, um, Christianity spread so fast because no matter
where the Christians went, the locals recognize something in Christianity that had been taken
from them.
And that's exactly right.
And, uh, I think I've mentioned before on this show that my favorite piece of, uh, of
Christian, you know, well, technically as a Catholic, I shouldn't say scripture.
It's not in my Bible.
I don't have a Bible.
Uh, but the, uh, the Coptic gospels, the gospels of, uh, Thomas, Philip, and, um, sometimes
it's called truth.
Sometimes it's called wisdom.
It's Alethaia, the, the Greek for, for truth or wisdom, which literally means unforgetting.
So you could also call it the book of an amnesia.
Um, if you can read those gospels with a good commentary, uh, you know, good footnotes,
good, good, uh, comparative linguistic analysis, there's a, there at least used to be anyway,
a site called meta gospel where, where you could do that.
But it will immediately become very clear to you that Christianity at its root, Christianity
when it started was not a monotheistic religion has never really at its root been a monotheistic
religion that, um, some of you who have been Catholics may know this, but as a Catholic,
you are raised to believe in what is called the triune God that is the father, the son
and the Holy spirit.
And when you ask, okay, so they're all, they're all the same thing.
The answer is no, no, they're very, very different.
And then you ask, okay, so they're all, so they're all like different and separate.
And then they say, oh no, no, no.
They're all the same thing.
It's, uh, I mean, if you want to, you know, ponder fucking mystic paradoxes, that's, that's,
that's your weekend buddy.
But, um, it's, it's, it's incomprehensible at the root because it's a lie because it's
not true.
And if you get into the, you know, comparative textual analysis of this stuff, you will see
very, very clearly that you have God, the father, you know, the God who is ostensibly
the same as, uh, the God of, uh, Islam, the God of Judaism, so on and so forth.
Then you have the Holy spirit, the, uh, the word, I can't remember if it's Hebrew or Aramaic,
maybe both of them is Ruach.
It's, uh, R-U-A and then either C-H or K-H depending on where you read it.
And Ruach, uh, literally means breath, but it is also a feminine noun.
And then you have the son, Jesus Christ.
And in these early gospels, if, if you have, you know, the linguistics on your side, it is
very, very clear that at least the Coptic gospels, and they are some of the oldest we have, you
know, the Coptic gospels are far closer, whatever, to whatever Christianity would have been in,
you know, a hundred AD than fucking Thomas Aquinas is or whatever.
It's very clear that in these gospels, the idea is that there is a God, the father, there
is also a God, the mother, the Ruach.
And then there is a God, the son, that there is not one God.
There is the shared Godhead of a father, mother, and son.
And of the father and mother's life giving to their child and, and grief for his pain and
of the son's understanding of, of his responsibility and willingness to suffer that in, in order to
obtain some kind of freedom, uh, for, well, one might argue himself.
Uh, but in theory also for other people, it, it really couldn't be more obvious.
You know, God is the prime mover.
He sets everything in motion, right?
But the Ruach, the Holy ghost, that is literally the breath in the lungs of Christ.
That is, you know, there, there are so many creation mythologies that involve, um, making
a human-like figure out of clay, mud, whatever, and then breathing into it, uh, into the mouth,
nostrils, whatever.
I mean, that's, that's the Bible.
And, uh, the breath, I, most of you probably know that spirit literally means breath.
Ruach as well.
The word that would have been much more, uh, uh, much more au courant among the people
who actually wrote the Bible.
They would have seen clearly that it was a feminine noun that was being employed basically
to describe the female force of the divine.
And when I say female, I'm not, you know, I'm not trying to do some reductive fucking
sex essentialist bullshit, whatever.
I'm saying female in terms of, you know, the archetypal balances, yin yang, all, all of
that kind of thing.
And then the sun is supposed to be the balance between these forces, between the, you know,
the commanding father God and the life giving mother God.
And it is both his, his, uh, responsibility and, and his, his, you know, sacrality to be
able to balance those things, his direct inheritance of Godhood, uh, with the nature of humanity.
And in so doing to show that humanity, that all people are the sons and daughters of these
two gods, you know, Jesus, he said all the time who his father was and that he was the
son of God.
He never said, uh, by the way, that's only for me.
That's not any of the rest of you.
And, uh, when I call you children of God, it's a, it's a metaphor.
So don't run away with that.
But, uh, when I call me the children of God, I literally mean God fucked my mother.
No, that's not in there.
Um, and tracing back the history of paganism and, uh, it's, it's inclusion within the history
of Christianity will lead you, I think, to some very worthwhile insights, which I'm going
to try to trace over, you know, however many hours I, I, uh, I can get from this.
And I think, um, on, on the question now of, of neo-medievalism of the, you know, the medieval
return in post-productive capitalism.
I think, uh, in particular terms about the saints and about the cults of the saints.
I don't know if you fucking Protestants, uh, really do that shit.
I don't know, honestly, how many Protestant, uh, sects pray to saints and shit.
I gather not many because I gather that was, you know, one of the, the impetite between,
or rather behind people like, you know, Luther and Calvin, uh, deciding like, Hey, this shit
isn't in the Bible.
What the fuck is going on here?
By the way, John Calvin, John fucking Calvin.
I mostly don't think when I hear questions like if you could go back in time and kill
Hitler, blah, blah, blah.
My honest answer to that question is that there probably would have been another Hitler.
It probably just would have been somebody else, man.
If someone said you can go back in time and kill John Calvin, Ooh, I got to think hard about
that one.
Anyway, the, the, the, you know, the Protestant break, uh, with the Catholic church had lots
to do with, uh, the essential worship.
I mean, they don't like to call it that, but it is of the saints and of the practice of a
Mariolatry, uh, that is venerating, uh, the Virgin Mary essentially is a God as well.
And the thing that first made me think of all of this in relation to paganism, in relation
to, uh, the medieval period to early in transitional Christianity, and then to David Bowie and the
stars are out tonight.
And the idea of the iconosphere is the striking resemblance, uh, between the medieval cult of
praying to the saints and the contemporary treatment of celebrity.
Now it would be really facile to say like, you know, people love famous people so much.
They treat them like gods.
That's not, that's not what I'm talking about.
I, I'm talking about the, the, the asphyxiate the walled in, uh, trap of, of medievalism that
has now in large part returned the idea that you are a fixed part in a social order.
You live in your little fucking cave.
You come out to do the work we told you to do, and then you go the fuck back home and you don't
ever think, man, I wonder what it would be like if I didn't, um, shovel pig shit 38 hours a day.
I wonder if what it would be like if, uh, in the words of a guy I used to know,
my one day off every year was the 37th of Nevuary.
Uh, no, no, no.
You're not thinking about that.
And so obviously there has to be a pressure release valve to this desperate longing for
a better life.
And in medieval Catholicism, medieval Christianity, that release valve was the cult of the saints
that you could find whatever saint corresponded to whatever it was you were interested in.
And, and you could go by all kinds of things by, you know, this guy is the patron saint
of, you know, twine strings and packages.
And it really does get that specific.
That's not a joke.
Um, or you could just generally go like, Hey, I'm in Paris and this, this guy was from
fucking our or whatever.
This was Bernard de Clairvaux.
So, so he'll get me.
I mean, I'm a French guy, you know, we'll know how to talk.
And the, the combination of utter social and political and economic stasis with the constant
invocation of these figures who were human, were human once, arguably are part still human,
but now live in this realm above you.
And the fact that you are, you know, you're working from the same fucking text as everybody
else.
Everybody, you know, knows who the saints are that you're talking about, right?
Well, it seems like that should be that sort of social arrangement should be the product
of, you know, ignorance and lack of information.
And now we have, uh, more information than we could possibly have dreamt of even 60 years ago.
And it's back.
This is how people are living again.
They are spending their times, their lives rather trapped in horrifying work to the bone
fucking cloisters that are destroying their brains and bodies.
And the way they deal with it is to go to a place, usually a virtual place full of people
who already believe the same shit as them and essentially pray to celebrities, pray that,
you know, you will be so well understood by the next Taylor Swift album or Donald Trump knows
how you personally are suffering.
And that's why he's going to revalue the Iraqi dinar.
It's the same shit.
It's the same goddamn thing.
And, uh, some of you will remember a show I did, God, I don't know, a couple of years ago, maybe,
with Matt Chrisman called, uh, Q Infinitum about, uh, QAnon, arguing that it was a far from being
an anomaly or some freak phenomenon that QAnon, in fact, was going to be the model of politics.
From this point forward, which is to say, we have a political system in which anyone who
does any digging at all, uh, can discover very quickly, oh yeah, these motherfuckers, they
have, uh, they don't know who we are or care about us or do anything we say.
Um, and every four years it's a fucking game show to replace them and nothing we do matters.
It's just the same game show over and over.
Well, a lot of people can't admit that to themselves.
And so instead they have to come up with, uh, essentially Gnostic narratives of what is
really going on in politics.
I think reactionary Gnosticism was the, the term me and Matt used.
And this is equally true for fucking Obama people and Trump people.
You know, with Obama, it was always, yeah, I know, I know it looks like he's getting his
ass absolutely crushed every fucking day for eight years.
I know it looks like he's just getting slapped in the face by a series of older and older and
more and more decrepit white men and not doing anything.
But this is actually his grand plan.
And soon you're going to see, you remember when it was a real topic of conversation, um,
on Obama's last day and Trump's first day, there were really people saying like, he's
not going to leave the white house.
He's going to refuse to give up the presidency to Donald Trump because he knows that yes,
that's, that's a risky bargain, but it's one that he has to take.
And then Obama got up to give a speech and was like, uh, I'm going to Hawaii.
Fuck all you stupid motherfuckers.
And then he just disappeared.
It's equally true with Obama as with Trump and QAnon, you know, the white hat pedophile.
Donald Trump has assiduously been the worst person in America for 50 years because he was
gathering intel.
And that, that is not just our model for politics now.
That is our model for cultural engagement.
That because we are stuck, because we all live in a gigantic fucking sepulcher with, you
know, what?
Eight billion separate chambers in it.
We can't leave.
We can't change anything.
So instead we go through the book of hours and we find the right prayer.
And then we go through the book of saints and we implore him or her to please God change something
about my life.
Fix something that makes me live in hell.
Unless of course that's not in line with God's plan.
In which case I will keep suffering for the, uh, the medium term, let's say.
And I'll talk to you later.
As, uh, as Patrick Bateman used to say, keep your eyes open.
Hold on a little bit.
A little bit like I say.
Okay.
So.
Absolutely.
Let's check on that.
Beautiful day.
And you understand that.
Peace será.
To be honest.
Let's check on that.
giving away.
And I willい.
Repeat in suspense for life.
A lot of things are possible.
Well, I grew up in the client state of a petro king
With a complicated take on things like human rights
But baby, that's the sacrifice
For bringing joy to the world
And I learned young how the West was won
With Christ's big heart and a bigger gun
It wasn't enough, so we took the moon
Cause Nazi rock, it's science too
Can bring joy to the world
The war on drugs, this righteous cause
To clear our streets of criminals
Now civilized by an opioid
So the Sackler family can enjoy
Spreading joy around the world
For New York City, the world loves you
When retribution's surely due
For the zealous who brought you hell
Boy, the heroes and Langley taught them well
How to infiltrate joy
And do it to the world
We all just get along
We all just get along
Like Amazon and Raytheon
Coming together to make a drone
To bring us lunch
To bring us lunch and kill the sons
In a sick, just a two for one
Holistic joy
To the world
To the world
To the world
Please stop resisting all the joy
To the world
Please stop resisting all the joy
In your world
Just a car full of celebrities
Singing about the joy
In your world
Just a car full of celebrities
Singing about the joy
In your world
In your world
A string of bad luck
In this final turn
We gathered around
We watched our cities burn
Who could have possibly predicted this?
Said everyone
So we boldly venture into the black
Guided by a ground soundtrack
We'll liberate some foreign stars
And stick a flag on the face of Mars
The beauty of starting again
Your patience, zero and original sin
The mantra rings across the land
How clever!
Look at us, we've done it again!
We're bringing joy
To whole new worlds
You must admit
We've certainly got enough
For bringing joy
To whole new worlds
In time these aliens will wander
We've certainly got enough
To whole new worlds
We've certainly got enough
To whole new worlds
We're bringing joy
To whole new worlds
We're bringing joy
To whole new worlds
We're bringing joy
To whole new worlds
We're bringing joy
We're bringing joy
To your world
We're bringing joy
To your world
You better hope you don't have cheap bananas or ice
We're bringing joy
To your world
You better hope you don't have dead dinosaurs or ice
