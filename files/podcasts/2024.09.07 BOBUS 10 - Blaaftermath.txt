Well, because this is all going in, I'm not editing a fucking thing.
Welcome, folks.
It is time for a Bobas episode, because we did a Wits Endless Summer this week, and,
well, it didn't really have any adventures in Odyssey for you hogs out there.
We got you a little bit of slop.
We got something for you piggies.
We've had folks beating down the door saying, where's my quit?
So, we've got an episode for you.
We're going back in time, like Huey Lewis and or the News once sang about.
I saw the Back to the Future musical over the weekend.
You did?
Yeah.
I did.
My parents were in town, and I don't think I've ever seen my dad that entertained.
Really?
Yeah.
Okay, so.
He was enthused, shall we say.
I hear the car is very cool.
The car is incredible.
It's one of the coolest things I've seen.
Is it worth seeing just for the car, then?
I don't know.
I don't know.
How expensive are tickets still?
Can you get in for relatively cheap?
I mean, yeah.
I was able to...
You can get tickets at half.
There's always seats available, so you can go down to the half price, and you can get
good orchestra tickets for like 80 bucks.
Okay.
So bad.
Or you can get something cheaper up in the Mez.
And the nice thing about the Winter Garden is that it's not that deep.
It's just really, really wide.
Right, right, right.
It's a fountain flowing that way.
Yeah, that's right.
That's right, Josh.
So anyway, aside from the details of fucking box office business shit that everyone came
here for...
It's stuck in my brain, asshole.
The music is good?
No.
No.
Oh, it's so bad.
No, it's...
I listened to that soundtrack for the first time in Josh's apartment in its entirety, and
I had to stop at several points or I was going to absolutely lose my mind.
That's the thing.
It's Alan Silvestri.
He writes for orchestras, and he's really good at it.
Yeah, I don't know.
He doesn't write song and dance.
It should have been Huey Lewis.
It should have been Huey Lewis.
Well, and that's the thing, right, is that Huey Lewis had his musical this past summer,
and it closed immediately.
I didn't even realize that.
Wait, what's the Huey Lewis music?
You didn't hear the news?
It was called The Heart of Rock and Roll.
And was it original music?
No, no.
It was a box for him.
Oh, see, that's not what I mean.
I mean, Huey Lewis really actually committed and being like, I'm going to write a fucking score
like Burt Bacharach did Promise His Promises.
I don't think he can anymore.
Or Randy Newman for Faust.
But I literally don't think he can anymore because he got that ear thing.
He's gone almost entirely deaf, so I don't think he can do it.
Well, Kurosawa directed Ron when he was almost totally blind.
Beethoven.
Oh, that's true.
He made all those movies.
I didn't even know a Saint Bernard could live that long.
Yeah.
He made a fifth.
He got to the fifth.
That's true, he did.
Longer than Air Bud.
Yeah, it sure did.
I mean, here's the thing about Air Bud.
That first movie is kind of harrowing and bleak and dark in a way I did not remember.
It's like a lot of kids' movies in the 80s and 90s.
AJ, there's no rule that says that a dog movie has to cater to your sensibilities.
No, that's true.
But then it's just so weird because everyone after that was like, oh, isn't it crazy that a dog's doing things?
And the first movie is like, what if a clown was an alcoholic and beat his dog almost to death?
But what if that dog then got very good at basketball but then returned to the alcoholic clown and was beaten some more?
Have you seen Air Bud?
I've seen Air Bud, I believe, one time.
I've seen it kind of three times.
I don't think I've ever seen the whole movie.
But I've definitely seen most of it.
Yeah, it's a TNT movie.
You catch it on the tube.
Yeah, you catch it in 10-minute installments.
Yeah.
It actually, I think, really works as a movie in a way that none of the sequels work as movies.
I'm going to disagree.
I mean, I'll agree with you that it is a more solid movie than any of the sequels.
I am not going to agree with you that it works, though.
I like that we were like, hey, folks, more Wits End Summer.
Now we spent five minutes talking about Back to the Future in Air Bud.
We are talking about show business because this is an episode of Adventures in Odyssey that is about show business.
Yeah, this is actually secretly our, what, fourth episode about Hamlet?
Yes.
This is our little Hamlet for your little Hamlet.
That's right.
And here we have Edwin Blackard, and this is right after his brother Regis has died.
This episode is called Welcome Back, or no, Welcome Home, Mr. Blackard.
That's right.
Episode 342 released January 20th of 1996.
That's right.
Ross Perot lost again.
Okay.
Wait, no.
He wouldn't lose until later this year.
Wait.
When did you?
In 96?
That would be November of 96.
God damn it.
Fuck.
Ross Perot is thinking about it again.
He's thinking about it.
Bob Dole's getting it up.
He's contemplating the orb.
Bob.
Winning Iowa, probably.
I don't know what Bob Dole won, primary-wise, but you know how it is.
He won my heart.
He won his way to my heart.
This is unfortunately a Phil Lawler episode, and he tries to be very literate in this one.
He sure does.
Did you know he read Hamlet?
Okay.
On the way over.
I'm going to clear this up top.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think that this is about as good of a script as Phil Lawler is capable of writing.
I agree.
I really think so.
This is almost a passable episode.
But there is something so, which I didn't remember from my childhood.
I always thought this was a funny episode when I was a kid.
There's something very uncanny about it.
There's something like, like it's imitation dialogue.
I don't know how else to say it.
It's just-
It's a diet odyssey.
It's like when you watch an episode of like Buffy or Angel, and everyone is like really stilted,
and then it turns out the whole episode was like a demon putting them under some kind of illusion,
and then it has like some sort of like tonal shift.
But that's what it feels like.
The house episode where, you know, it turns out that he's been like under the whole time.
Yeah.
He's just like, how did I get here from the stairs?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
It was a very pivotal moment of TV for me.
So that's why Walter Shakespeare's testicle exploded.
Anyway, here's a six episode arc with Lin-Manuel Miranda.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah, Brian, I kind of understand what you're saying.
I kind of took that uncanniness to be that we're just seeing the world through Edwin's eyes.
Since we are in his perspective, this is how he thinks people talk to him and how he kind of sees the world.
But I also think that like every single episode that Phil Lawler has ever written, he just misses the point of his own episode.
Yes.
Including this one, by the way.
And he misses all the best opportunities for jokes and situations.
Well, I mean, because the true thing, what this episode I think wants to be about is about Edwin and his relationship with Regis.
And how when you lose somebody that's close to you, even if you know you are estranged, that there is a part of you that feels guilty because you weren't able to like get through to them.
And that the opportunity for them to ever connect is now fucking gone.
Because now he's found himself in the aftermath.
Yes.
Which is what this episode is called.
That's the title of this episode.
Which we all agreed upon in unison without argument.
Yes.
Yes.
We actually, we all stared into the Zoom screen at the same time.
And we all said, blah, aftermath.
At the same time.
It's not even where the double A happens, but it doesn't matter.
This was all me.
This was me.
I walked into this call and I was like, we have to call this blah, aftermath.
Shoot.
I was going to say, debate in the comments which one of us you think proposed it and which one of us was the whole thing.
They can still debate it because they don't know who's talking right now.
That's right.
They don't know.
I'm the worst of all possible Brian's.
I've just, I've just ruined it again.
Oh God.
And I'm Mickey Mouse.
Yes.
Yes.
I, I think that.
AJ died.
He's not in this call.
I know.
Rep.
Yeah.
No, I'm not.
Good one.
Oh no.
Yeah.
No, I, I think that there's something that, because again, the show can't acknowledge that Regis Blaggard has any redeemable qualities or that he was worth anything to anyone.
Right.
And so it goes in with the assumption, well, we all knew this guy sucked.
So what can Edwin feel bad about?
What can he feel guilty about?
Right.
And what he feels guilty about is that he wasn't there to murder his brother faster.
Yeah.
Which is weird.
Is that, well, is, is that, what do you think?
We'll get to it.
We'll sort of get to sort of what the crux of his thing is.
Because they dance around that a little bit.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But I, I, I do want to sort of bridge the gap here between, you know, where we left off with Darkness Before Dawn and now, right?
Because Edwin Blaggard, we will recall, is the thespian brother of Regis Blaggard, the big bad.
And Regis Blaggard, of course, died in the tunnels under Witt's End, whereas Jack Allen, of course, was thrown clear of the explosion.
Yes.
Jack Allen tried to do the Dobson Bundy interview with him where he saved his soul and it didn't, it didn't take.
Right.
Yeah.
Got the bad ending.
Yeah.
Just like with Jack's wife.
Hmm.
Spoilers.
What?
Wait, why?
What?
Don't worry.
Oh, no.
Anyway.
Regis Blaggard exploded like Walter Shakespeare's testicle.
Anyway, please.
Ooh.
Well, I think they were like, you know, they must have realized we can't just lose Earl Bowen.
Yeah.
Like, we've got to get him back.
And it's the same reason, like, why Eugene was invented.
Right.
Because Officer Harley, they had to get rid of him and they're like, well, we're not getting rid of Will
Ryan.
He's Ziggy.
And so what they did was they decided to write an episode that would bring Edwin back in because
he was basically written out of the show and could have stayed written out of the show had
they so desired.
Right.
You, I mean, you always kind of want to dangle that thread in the hope that they'll come back.
Right.
So they send him on tour and that's where we meet up with him at the, at the tippy top
of this episode.
He is in Pecanburg.
Yeah.
Yeah.
State unknown.
And he has just finished up his one man Hamlet.
And, and this is the curtain call for that show.
Good people of the Ticamberg.
Really, really good sound design.
This is the last performance of our two man troop in your town.
So on behalf of the Edwin Blaggard traveling players, I want to thank you for the use of
your high school auditorium stage and for allowing us to bring a little Hamlet to your little
Hamlet.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Thank you.
Yes.
Thank you.
Farewell.
No more, please.
No more.
Good night.
I like the little shower curtain sound.
Oh, oh, that's what that was.
It's like a curtain that's like hanging on something.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, that's exactly what that is.
Oh, that's so funny.
I mean, there are so many good little sound jokes here.
Maybe a few too many.
Maybe.
But I will say when he says my Hamlet has gone to the dogs and then there's just a very
quiet bark in the background.
That got me.
That got me.
That got me really hard.
Yeah.
They got you really what?
Hard.
Okay.
It got you.
No, no, no.
It got me hard.
Not like that.
Jesus.
Hard is an adverb describing how it got you.
Again, AJ's doghouse.
Very different parallel universe.
Right.
Right.
Right.
Right.
Right.
As opposed to the same parallel universe.
I'd like to think that that dog in the in the background was was actually just the same
good idea guy from the Gilead Lane episode just transformed into a dog and begging for
help.
Yeah.
Sure.
Sure.
Your mind.
Yeah.
I also love to think that a dog is a guy from a different show is a human man from elsewhere.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know, every dog I see is just a man from somewhere else.
You know, I like listening to QAA as as we all do.
Yeah.
And sometimes I listen in and I'm just like, Jake, is there AJ?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know what would happen if we get Jake Rokitansky and AJ Diddy together in one podcast.
But one day, I swear to God.
It could be too powerful.
We'll see.
We'll see.
It would be AJ Diddyansky.
I don't know how to combine our last names.
Diddyansky?
Diddyansky.
There it is.
AJ Diddyansky?
AJ Diddyansky.
Diddyansky.
I made a mistake by starting this without my air conditioner on.
So I'm turning it on now.
Okay.
So audience, if you hear some noise after this, it's because my air conditioner is on.
Ooh.
Did you just use the remote to turn that on?
That's pretty cool.
I just used my telephone.
Oh.
Ooh.
Isn't the future amazing?
It's got a Bluetooth control and I do also have a remote for it.
Okay.
Yeah.
So I can turn it on when I'm not home.
I just want to think of like, if I'm like thinking about my furniture and I'm like, I bet they'd like to cool down.
Yeah.
Your furniture's sweating.
Kill me.
For the love of God.
I'm melting.
So let's get back to Edwin here, right?
Yeah.
Because he is on the road with Walter Shakespeare, his beloved.
He's a lover.
Yes.
Yes.
They are gay men who love each other very, very much, which I've always found interesting.
And I know we've talked about this a little bit, but like they are so explicitly gay coded and I can't tell.
Like if they really lean into it in the car later.
I didn't click that, but it's, it's like, Oh, Shakespeare, the horrible dreams I'm having.
They love each other.
Yeah.
And it's so nice.
Yeah.
He really, they really care about each other.
Like, like Walter, like there is no like, Oh my boss.
Right.
Like he genuinely really, really wants him to succeed.
It's very sweet.
And if Phil Lawler knew that we were calling them gay, he would respond by quoting his doing his favorite quote from Hamlet, which is saying no.
That is his favorite quote from Hamlet.
Because he's the cleverest boy there ever was.
Yeah.
Because he read Hamlet once.
I mean, yeah.
On the way here.
He and I have that in common.
So Edwin needs to calm down.
Yes.
After that performance.
He's a thirsty boy.
That's right.
Shakespeare!
My lemonade!
Yes, sir.
Here you are.
Ah!
Ah!
Heavenly nectar.
Yes!
He's just, I know I've said this so many times, but Earl Bowen is just so fucking good.
Like, yeah.
This could be, in the hands of a lesser actor, this would be nothing.
And I think there are multiple points in this episode where I handed it to Phil Lawler, but the reality of the situation is it's just Earl Bowen taking the material to another level entirely.
Yeah.
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
I do, like, I mean, what's amazing about Edwin, like, just in terms of, like, the tightrope that Earl Bowen is walking during this whole thing is that he never feels like he, as the actor, is going over the top.
He is just portraying a ham.
Yes.
Yes.
Which is such a tricky thing to do.
It is.
And this is the most we've seen Edwin really acting.
Yeah.
And it's pretty clear he's just not talented.
Yeah.
No.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But again, it's not Earl Bowen making fun of him for being untalented.
Yeah.
He's just being untalented.
Yes.
And that is very tricky to do with just your voice.
He is untalented, but he's also deeply, deeply earnest about it.
Yeah.
Yes.
And, you know, I think that there's a different version of this performance that would come across as very mean and very cynical.
But it's clear that Earl Bowen loves this character a lot.
Yes.
And I just think that's really delightful.
I mean, he's my favorite character on the show by far.
I mean, Wooten's obviously a second contender, but, like, you can't beat Edwin Blackguard.
Yeah.
No.
I'm sure you both have also performed for houses like this.
Of course.
Oh, yes.
Yeah, where it's mostly made up of livestock.
We did Hamlet once where we decided to do a 10 a.m. matinee, but I guess none of the schools that we were trying to invite to it came.
Nobody showed up.
We were doing it at the same time.
But we made it into Minecraft.
Yeah, there's, like, a writing festival that happens at Calvin College.
Yes.
And so it was kind of lined up with that, but no one showed up except for one of our professors, Michael, who's such a sweetheart.
And it was in the round.
Right.
So you're playing to entire banks of the house that have known it.
So there were 10 people.
And we had six.
God.
Wedges of audience there.
So we told everyone to spread out.
How many times?
No, you clump them together.
You have to clump them together.
No, because it's in the round, AJ.
It's a round stage.
They're all around us.
Oh, God.
They had to do asides to one place.
To one guy.
Yeah.
So I was like, please, God, let somebody be there.
What a nightmare.
But then once they're spread out, they don't laugh as easily.
Right.
Because it's not like there's not like the peer pressure on it.
I mean, to be fair, they weren't really laughing anyway.
I guess it's Hamlet.
Even when the house was full.
Oh, no.
The audience loved me as Polonius.
I'm not going to lie.
Yeah.
I actually did.
I find I kind of do my best work in front of audiences that are openly hostile.
Oh, sure.
I feel like everyone's just like, they get backstage and they get really demoralized.
And I'm just like, I'm going to win them over by the end.
It's like, I'll show you, motherfucker.
I'll show you.
You want bad.
I'm taking us into the sea.
Well, and I feel like Edwin brings some of that energy too, right?
Yeah.
Like, he very much allows his haters to be his waiters.
I'm going to keep using that reference every week because I think it's funny.
And when I think about Eric Adams and his face.
Josh is going to use it.
Until Eric Adams is finally driven out of office.
That's right.
And then I, then he will be my waiter.
Yeah.
I will be his hater and he will be my waiter.
Anyway.
The haters will be waiters until morale improves.
That's right.
One of my, one of my former bosses talked about, there's this restaurant that he really likes
going to that's like way out, like on the west, west of Hell's Kitchen.
Like, it's like basically on the highway.
Sure.
And it's just a mob front.
Like, no one's ever there.
Yeah.
But a couple of the times that he has gone there, the only other person in that restaurant
has been Eric Adams and some union leader.
That sounds about right.
Totally having a normal meeting.
That's awesome.
I love that.
Oh, that's incredible.
It's like one of the few things that I unironically love about New York City politics is how like
the old school labor corruption is still a big, big part of the city.
Yeah.
You just have to go to a restaurant owned by a Bulgarian guy that's just used to launder
his like fentanyl money.
It's like, it's here.
It's Chicago.
It's some parts of DC and basically nowhere else.
Yeah.
And it's always nice to go into those restaurants not knowing that and being like, I would like
a sandwich.
And they'd be like, no.
And they look terrified.
Yeah.
They have no idea what to do.
Well, there's meat on two meats and bread in between.
Yes.
Okay.
And it's just meats and a little slice of bread in between it.
Yeah.
Well, to the point of powerful guys who are kind of moving paper around.
Right.
Edwin is, you know, just sipping his lemonade and then a new guy shows up.
A new, a brand new man.
I'm Morton Dunkey, attorney at law.
Attorney?
A lawyer.
Now look, this is about that incident in Hooterville.
I'm not here about an incident at Hooterville.
Hooterville.
I'm a partner in the firm Dunkey, Dunkey, Dunkey, Dunkey and McCormick.
Actually, I'm the third Dunkey.
Well, congratulations.
I'm so happy for you.
Thank you.
We represented your brother, the late Dr. Regis Blackard.
Yeah.
So, the Dunkey, Dunkey, Dunkey, Dunkey and McCormick.
That's good.
I will say a fun fact about that law firm.
It didn't work out, so they folded and restructured as big mode games.
Hey.
Get it?
Huh?
Get it?
It's a video game Dunkey joke.
Yeah.
I think that joke went over pretty animal well.
I see you guys liked the little Hooterville reference.
Yeah.
Is that something?
Is that something?
Is that a reference?
Yeah.
Oh.
That's the town from Green Acres.
Oh, I just was thinking of Hooters.
I also thought of Hooters.
I was thinking about Ava Gabor.
So, we're on the same page.
Okay.
Ava Gabor was on Green Acres.
No, no.
I know.
I did that.
I know.
Oh, you know that, but you don't know that they live in Hooterville?
I thought you were making a joke about her sizable bosom.
No, she's on the show.
But also, yes.
She's got boobs.
I'll say she does.
This is the problem is that Josh will just say that on the street sometimes and point.
She's got boobs.
I will not do that.
I know.
I know.
I think.
Oh, no.
I think.
So, he has made this joke a lot.
He loves doing the law firm bit of donkey, donkey, donkey, donkey, and McCormick.
Like, he's done that.
Name, name, name, name, another name.
Name, name, name, other name, random other name.
I don't like the flow of this one.
Hmm.
It feels clunky.
Well, and he goes back to the same joke.
Whenever we have Blackard and Shakespeare especially where you just say the same thing three times,
where it's like one person says it, and then Blackard asks it, and then Shakespeare asks it.
Or they ask it, ask it, and then the person says it.
That's where it switches up.
And it's like, find another joke.
Find a joke, actually.
Because that's not a joke.
Just one.
That's the thing.
It's not a joke.
No.
But again, Earl Bowen saves it with the, I'm so happy for you, or whatever it is that he says.
It's like, goddamn.
Yeah.
Anyway, it turns out that this guy has showed up to let Edwin know that within Regis's will,
there were certain stipulations about what he is going to inherit.
Yeah.
Specifically, he is going to be inheriting the Electric Palace, the building and the land that it stands on.
And moreover, Bart has lost complete control because of the events of Darkness Before Dawn.
Yeah, because of the crimes.
It turns out that Bart, yeah, the way that they explain it is that Bart, because again, they didn't have to.
No, they sure didn't.
But they did explain it.
Which is that Bart took out a loan, and so then the loan was all from Blackard's, you know, Chicago-based electronics retail and logistics company.
Right.
Which is really, like, yeah, it's like, why would you be that specific?
Like, we knew from the beginning that he didn't own the store, so you could just say he defaulted on the loan, or defaulted on the lease, right?
He had to cancel whatever.
Like, you could take care of this in one line, and instead it's like a whole.
You could just say Bart didn't own it.
Right.
I think we kind of have to come to terms with the fact that they really love the logistics of, like, town councils and ordinances.
Yes, they do.
Which is really geek out.
They love yelling at the school board.
I thought for a second this was a Marshall Younger episode because of all of the unnecessary world buildings.
Of just all the lore.
Yeah, this feels like he had a hand in that.
He's like, oh, you know what?
We better explain this.
Yeah.
Blah, blah, blah.
Or the kids will be confused.
And I'm like, I don't know.
I get pretty lost in it.
Because also, my big question is, like, why does Regis want this for Edwin?
Well, that is mostly because he wants him to suffer.
Yeah, it's spite.
Because he's like, yeah, you either take over my electronics franchise or our mother gets thrown out onto the street.
Right.
This thing I know you hate.
But, like, there's just such a more interesting angle of it of, like, Regis being like, your life as an actor isn't real.
I'm a doctor.
I want you to be able to, like, sustain yourself.
Or you could still do it from a place of spite.
Right?
You could do it from a place of I know better than you.
You know, you have been suckling off the family teat for far too long.
It's time for you to get a grown-up job.
Yeah, and then for him to also be like, even in death, he never believed in me.
And for Jack to be like, hey, man, we believe in you.
Right.
That's interesting, too.
That's good drama.
But no, that's pathos.
No, because the real drama here is that Edwin fears moving back to Odyssey.
Right.
Because he left.
He left in the middle of a crisis.
And his twin brother done fucked it all up.
Right.
So on the way back to Ohio, Edwin has a dream.
A dream where he is faced by a man named John Q. Public, voiced by Corey Burton.
You deserve to be punished.
Yes.
Punished.
Since you behaved like a chicken, it's only fitting that you should look like one.
Bring out the tar.
The tar.
The tar.
The tar.
Pour it over him.
Go.
And now, the feathers.
The feathers.
The feathers.
The feathers.
The feathers.
Dump them on him.
One of them does the Howard Dean scream.
I heard that.
Four years before Howard Dean would do the Howard Dean scream.
This is where he got it from.
This is fucking great.
I love this.
Eight years.
Dean ran in 2004.
Oh, yeah.
You're right.
The writing is a little loose.
Yeah.
You want to talk about establishing a clear, weird, and immediate image.
Yeah.
And the way that he says, yes, punishment.
It's like, is he Catholic?
What's going on here?
Yeah, he really thinks that he deserves it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Which is, I think this doesn't quite fadge with Edwin's whole character, because he, they
even make a joke later where Shakespeare's like, I didn't think you had a conscience,
sir.
And he's like, well, neither did I.
Right.
And so I feel like the dream should just be him being victimized and not him going like,
yes, more.
You got to do more.
You got to.
Yeah.
You could make that tar hotter.
I don't mind him being a real sucker for punishment, like a little bit of a masochist.
I think that's really interesting, actually.
Right.
It's just that you have to reconcile that with the remainder of the episode.
Yeah.
I mean, the tarring and feathering, too, is just such a graphic thing.
I think it's just, I mean, it's deadly.
That's what I never knew about tar and feathering, was that it was a death sentence.
It doesn't always kill people, but it does maim you, at least.
It's going to fuck you up.
I mean, that is hot tar.
It is hot tar, but it also, what it does is it closes up your pores so, like, oxygen
can't get in.
So a lot of people asphyxiated when they got tarred and feathered back in the day.
People breathe through their mouths and noses.
Not if it's covered with tar.
Not if it's covered in tar.
But it's not a pore.
There was, I mean, I remember.
It's the biggest pore.
It's not.
You know, it's like, you know, there's a, Big River doesn't completely land the plain,
I think, in a lot of aspects.
But that tar and feathering scene is fucking harrowing.
Big River the musical?
Yeah.
Have you seen it?
There's some bootlegs going around of like, I think, a touring production.
I think that maybe the, I forget which one I saw.
But yeah.
With John Goodman.
Yeah, he kind of staggers on stage.
Yeah.
I don't think, I don't think the one I saw was with John Goodman.
Okay.
Yeah.
John Goodman was on Broadway once, folks.
Well, he's on Broadway a few times.
But he was on Broadway in a musical once.
Yeah, you can hear him sing.
He's got a good voice.
He plays pap.
It's Huckleberry Finn, for those of you who don't know.
I don't know why we got this detailed, again, on theater stuff.
Yeah, why are we going into Big River?
I don't know.
Because the tar and feathering scene.
It's tar and feathering.
It's the tar, and this is about, this is an episode about the theater.
I think of tar and feathering depicted seriously.
I think of John Adams, the miniseries.
Oh.
Oh, shit.
Yeah.
That was one of the big moments of escalation was us tar and feathering some lobster backs.
Huh.
The lobster backs.
Sorry, I did it in the proper pronunciation of the time.
Lobster backs.
No, but I, so I just, this jumped out at me in a way that scenes for Adventures in Odyssey
don't normally jump out at me.
Like, in so far as it is remarkably intense for a children's show.
Like, it kind of reminded me of the Hunchback of Notre Dame a little bit.
Yeah, yeah.
Like Hellfire?
Yeah.
No, no, no, no.
Quasimodo out in the, well, whatever.
In the festival.
Hellfire is followed by himself in a room alone.
No, I just thought he meant in terms of, like, intensity.
No, I think both.
Okay.
I think, I think both.
I think you're talking about, yes, the scene of Quasimodo out there, but the emotional intensity
and musicality, honestly, of Hellfire.
And, of course, Tony Jay, who played Clark Frollo, plays the Blackard equivalent in the
Odyssey cartoon.
Oh, that's right.
Right.
Because that's just what they did.
You just, you got Bowen for one and Tony Jay for the other, and that's just what they
did for their entire lives.
They high-fived on the way out of the booth.
Yeah.
I'm not saying that this is, like, great life-changing drama or anything.
I'm just saying that when it comes to Adventures in Odyssey, I'll take what I can get.
Well, and after listening to Adventures in Odyssey from the 2010s and 2020s, it's like,
oh, yeah, no, they did know how to write Once Upon a Time.
Not to mention fucking enduring that live show.
Yeah.
That 90-minute episode.
But I also think that the reason it's so gripping is because you care about Edwin in a way that
you don't really care about most of the other characters.
That's true.
Yeah.
At least I...
Which is all just character.
It's all just like he brings something so distinctive...
Yes.
...to the recording booth that you latch onto it.
It's the same thing as, like, seeing a cartoon character or seeing a puppet.
Something that's very, very well designed.
You're like, okay, I'm already there with you.
Well, and I think Walker Edmiston does this with Bart, too.
Mm-hmm.
You know, just to sort of move on to what happens next here.
Sure.
Edwin runs into the Rathbones, Bart and Doris, both of them.
Yeah, and this is AJ's first time ever hearing Doris Rathbone.
Yeah.
She sounds...
Bart!
Doris!
Huh?
Hello!
Ah!
It's you!
Dr. Blaggard!
Dr. Blaggard?
Ah!
No!
No!
How can you be alive?
He's a ghost!
A ghost!
Ah!
No, no, no, no.
I'm not Regis.
I'm Edwin.
Edwin!
Edwin?
Yes, you know, the actor.
The actor.
Doris, it's only the actor.
Only.
We could have sworn you was the other one.
You nearly scared us out of our skins.
Yeah, she talks like me as Butch.
This feels like a cartoon in a good way.
Yeah, yeah.
I think.
These are all three cartoon characters.
Yeah.
Yeah, this is once again Pamela Hayden.
Okay.
The Simpsons own Pamela Hayden, not playing Katrina this time, but playing Doris Rathboe.
Harley Quinn.
Oh, sorry.
Yes.
Yeah.
Like.
They're.
Yeah.
Again, they're all very distinctly drawn characters, but Phil Lawler doesn't quite know how to use
them.
No.
Here, like the everything in this scene is just said twice for some reason and not in a way
that's like building, not in a way that's like consciously a joke.
It's just for some reason, everyone says each thing twice.
The actor, the actor, only, only a ghost, a ghost.
And they make it work because they are so good at what they do.
Mostly make it work.
For me, this is why it falls into the uncanny valley because they're doing a lot, but it
feels like they're maybe trying a little too hard to make up for the, the really big
deficiencies.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, these things have to escalate.
And I don't think Phil Lawler knows how to do that.
He doesn't know like the, like, so if it's true that, uh, is it Dolores, right?
Her name is Doris.
Doris.
If it is true that Doris really believes that she is witnessing a ghost, then what else is
true?
Well, it means that she believes that ghosts are real.
Yeah.
Right.
And that is a fairly common occurrence that she sees them.
And there's a lot of comedy that can be mined from just that fact alone.
Absolutely.
But what he comes up with is saying the word ghost two times.
Yeah.
Right.
No, like Bart, Bart could say something.
He could be like, uh, no, that's not a ghost.
Like, but what about the one that I saw last week?
That was the mailman or something.
That's not funny.
But that's like an Odyssey joke.
Yeah.
Like that, like that's a thing that McCusker could pull off.
Yeah.
That Lawler is incapable of doing.
Well, and it feels like also in Hayden's delivery, it kind of feels like she's swinging
something at him.
And I kind of like, I want, I want her to hit him.
That's where I want this to go.
I want this to go to kind of a slapstick spot where she is so panicked and so ready to like
defend her husband from the ghost world.
Right.
Yeah.
He's one of those physical ghosts.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's so many opportunities that are just missed.
Yeah.
It's a bummer.
It kind of feels like, it kind of feels like when you're watching an improv show,
and it's like, it's a musical improv show and all the actors are like bouncing their
shoulders up and down and they're all just kind of looking at each other going, who's
going to go first?
Yeah.
We're having fun.
The vamp is still going.
There's no Colin Mochrie up there.
There's no Colin Mochrie.
There's no one willing to like leap into the fray.
And then you just end up vamping and the scene's done.
You need your Richard Simmons out there.
Yeah.
Rest in peace.
Such a great episode.
Such a talent.
Anyway, Edwin is basically having this crisis, right?
Right.
And this isn't helped by the fact that Bart and Doris are initially afraid of him and think
that he's Regis, right?
Yeah.
Right.
He specifically asks Edwin, like, how do people perceive my name around town?
And Bart tells him, well, there's none lower.
Now, Bart, of course, is referring to Regis.
He's talking about the blaggard name.
He's not talking about Edwin specifically.
But Edwin takes this on the chin.
And he's like, well, if the blaggard name is Mud, that means that so too am I.
And so he decides to walk over to Witt's End to sort of get a sense of where everybody
else is.
Which is crazy because we know this is on the one bus line in Odyssey.
That's right.
Right.
Go right from the Electric Palace to Witt's End.
Well, Brian, that's where you're wrong because Witt is no longer in town.
And so the bus has just been driving in a circle, not stopping.
Witt's the only one who has left.
Ever since Witt has left.
Yeah.
The bus driver has been driving around trying to find and kill every horse in the area for
sleeping with his wife.
That's right.
That's right.
I brought it back around to a joke from Witt's Endless Summer fucking three.
Let's go.
AJ's horse corner.
He's trying to find all the hilfs in his area and run them down.
Oh, hilfs.
I don't like that.
I mean, I didn't either, but here we are.
Also, Bart, again, while we're in the business of explaining everything, the lawyer does bring
up the fact that Bart was sentenced to two years of community service and probation, which
I don't think that's how community service works.
It's usually just measured in hours because you don't expect people to do it full time.
No, Brian, he's been given two years worth of hours.
He's going to be doing community service the rest of his life.
Unfortunately, I know how many minutes are in a year.
I do not know how many hours are in a year.
Well, you just divide by 60.
How do you measure?
Measure it.
Oh, I measure in love.
Oh, yeah.
Actually, that's probably the best metric.
You gotta.
I was going to name a lot of other stuff, but I feel like cutting straight to love is
probably.
And then I get a harmonica out and everyone's like, yeah, let's not do that for the later
recordings.
No, no.
Well, the harmonica's just for the radio edit they play at the end.
Anyway, it's a very strange.
And then a lady gets out in front of me and starts singing, and then she hits a really
high note and everybody claps.
Including behind her.
Everyone claps in unison.
That's true.
They clap behind her.
I'm clapping.
It's time now to sing out.
That's a reference to Rent, folks.
It's a musical Rent.
We just need to go see a musical and get this shit out of our system.
I'm jonesing.
This sucks.
I'm jonesing, baby.
I mean, I saw Back to the Future.
Yeah, you need to see, like, an actual musical.
No, I know.
I want to.
Well, anyway.
I didn't see the Sufjan one.
I probably should have done that.
It's more of a dance show.
Did Illinois' clothes?
Yeah, it did.
I was going to feel it.
Come on.
And feel.
Greetings.
Hark!
The UFO descends upon the podcast.
Three podcasters stare in awe.
Will they go?
Oh, my God.
They will not.
This is fucking un-lessenable.
Greetings from Michigan.
No, that's my line.
Yeah, that's true.
That's true.
We can't.
Hi, this is Sufjan.
This is Sufjan.
This is Sufjan.
This is Sufjan.
This is Sufjan.
Greetings from Michigan.
Oh, Lord.
So, where are we?
Who gives a shit?
Brian, is Paul Schrader our Sufjan Stevens?
Like, the only artist to make it out of our college who actually is, like, good?
I see what you mean.
Could I, like, what Sufjan was for Hope College?
Yeah.
Well, because didn't Hope also produce the guy who wrote the screenplay to Milk?
Didn't he go to Hope?
Oh, I don't know.
Oh.
So, I feel like that would be the equivalent of Schrader, if I'm not totally mistaken here.
Sure.
No, Schrader-
There is actually Milk later in this episode.
Yeah, like, this is-
I think Schrader is probably the most useful of the Calvin graduates.
Yeah.
That and Betsy DeVos, obviously.
Well, yeah.
I mean, two great minds.
Two great tastes that taste great together.
So much better together.
I've got Spike Lee.
Okay, so I'm actually- I will say this.
The one person who graduated from NYU worth a damn.
Yeah, the only one.
We have, like, almost 1,500 patrons at this point, so odds are good that at least one of
you motherfuckers went to Hope.
If you went to Hope College, sound off in the comments.
Yeah.
So that we can eliminate you.
No, no!
Hope springs eternal!
All right.
Anchor this, bitch!
That's right.
You won't be a flying Dutchman every time I'm through with you.
No, since we're on these stories, there was, like, a rock on our campus that people liked
to paint.
What?
Oh, yeah.
And so for the plays, we'd, like, we'd paint, like, come see Hamlet.
Right.
Whatever.
It was our form of viral marketing.
Right.
That and doing a flash mob where we said to be or not to be in a dining hall.
That didn't go over well.
Yeah, that was fucking dumb.
So one time.
Was it, like, Spartacus?
Did everyone just start standing, like, to say it at a time?
No.
Not everyone, but everyone in the, quote, flash mob.
This was a thing that millennials did, kids.
I don't recommend it.
Dude, we're so chuggy.
So one time Hope came by and they painted the paint rock and they did their little, like,
orange background and a blue anchor.
That's good.
That's right.
That was a scandal.
I remember that.
Well, we've talked about this.
Like, we went to a student, a school that had the most apathetic student body, period.
Right.
That rock got painted by the Hope kids, did not get repainted for three months.
Wait, really?
Yeah.
Wow.
It just sat there.
No one gave a shit.
That's so funny.
Wow.
Isn't there, there's a giant cube in Astor Place that also has a cube in Michigan, right?
That's a sister cube.
The big rotating cube?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
There's one in Ann Arbor.
Oh, yeah.
Like, at Michigan?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
In Ann Arbor.
That would make sense.
Yeah.
I think you might be right.
I think it might be, like, by the quad.
Because that was the only time that anything like that ever happened at NYU for me was that
people from Ann Arbor, Michigan flew in and covered the Astor Place cube as the companion
cube from Portal.
That's funny.
Like, they put a little thing over it and turned it into the companion cube.
That's also very millennial.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was very, very lovely.
I don't know if there was any retaliation, but.
I mean.
I like harmless pranks like that.
Some japery.
What I hate is the, as long as we're talking about Michigan, the tradition at Ohio State,
the Ohio State University, where on the day of the big game, you know, the rivalry game,
they go around campus and they cross off every single M on every single sign with tape.
That could be very confusing.
That's so stupid.
It's fucking dumb, man.
Yeah.
It's.
Do you know how I would prank back those Michiganders in Astor Place?
Aha.
I would, I would, uh, I would promise them a bunch of cake.
Yeah.
And then I would not deliver.
That's right.
Why?
Oh, because I'd be lying to them.
Yeah?
About the cake.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Right.
The cake itself would, in fact, be a fabrication.
Wow.
And I don't mean fabricated in my kitchen.
I mean fabricated in the mind.
Yeah.
As a deceptive object.
Right.
Right?
Yeah.
I think when I talk of cakes that you see them pressing their proud hooves in the earth,
about to be run over by Odyssey's one bus driver.
That's right.
We got back to Odyssey, folks.
Was it a horse or was it cake?
That was, the horse was a lie, AJ.
There's never been a horse.
Damn.
Damn.
Not once.
What have I been fucking?
So we have, so we have, uh, the, the, this whole like moment of crisis because Edwin
has come back to town, but he's got the electric palace, but he doesn't know what the heck
to do with it.
Yeah.
Because he's feeling so dang guilty about it.
Yeah.
And then he runs into Tom Riley.
Yeah.
He's like, he's, he's getting wound up.
He's getting all springy.
Right.
And then Tom Riley's like, hi.
And he goes, ah.
And then Tom Riley's like, isn't everything great?
And then he goes and meets Jack and Jack's like, isn't everything great?
Yeah.
It turns out that nobody actually holds any real animosity toward Edwin.
No, because they're all Christians.
And they're all very happy to see him.
And this is so fucking boring.
Yes.
It's like you had an opportunity to do something dramatically here that could be interesting
and you fucking threw it away.
Yeah.
Because they're all Christians.
Everybody loves him.
Everybody's happy.
There's no conflict.
No.
So the only conflict is internal and you gotta, you, if you're going to go that route, you
have to turn it all the way up.
And so this is Phil's attempt at doing that, which is that, you know, Edwin just starts
asking a lot of questions.
I just feel so awful about the whole thing.
Like I need to do something cleansing, redemptive to somehow make it up to Odyssey.
There's really no need, Edwin.
The best thing you can do, both for Odyssey and yourself, is to reopen the Harlequin Theater.
Yeah.
And the Electric Palace.
This town needs places like them.
Just don't run it like Bart did.
All for profit and not really caring about the customers.
Right.
Go and make it a wonderful store.
I love it.
I love it.
See, and then it's like, oh yeah, this is a Lawler episode.
Yeah.
And we always talk about like the, the worldview of this show and about being the right kind
of capitalist.
That's right.
Compassionate capitalism.
Here they just say it outright.
It's wonderful.
Odyssey needs places like a, a radio shack.
It's interesting.
Like I, a few months ago, uh, I went on the socialist shelf to talk about Richard DeVos's
book.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Which I think is called compassionate capitalism.
Uh, that's one of them.
Yeah.
We, we actually talked about a couple different Richard DeVos books.
Yeah.
Did you talk about, I'm, I'm trying to remember now.
It's been a while.
Yeah.
Me too.
Did you talk about Hope from My Heart?
No, we did not talk about Hope from My Heart.
We talked about his early books.
Okay.
Cause Hope from My Heart was the book that I got on eighth grade graduation because Richard
DeVos did on my eighth grade graduation.
Yeah.
He was our special speaker.
And he was a special speaker, uh, in chapel for us as well at Grand Rapids Christian.
Love that shit.
Didn't you call it Hope from My Butt or something like that?
Uh, on Wikipedia, if you go back far enough to 2009 from my school account, I was
who would repeatedly vandalize this page throughout my senior year of high school and retitle
it Hope from My Cunt.
There we go.
Okay.
Wow.
After he received a cunt transplant.
The thing is, he didn't need one.
He's a big enough one of those already as far as I'm concerned.
Yeah, but it gave him another 20 years.
No, no, no.
I know.
But I mean, such language so young.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, for Brian.
I was very well read once.
Did you read the books with the gold stars on them that were meant for, like, more mature
readers in your library?
The ones I had to get a special note from my mom to read because it talked about, um,
a woman's breast filling with milk.
Oh, so you have read Hope from My Cunt.
And that was the only question.
And that was, and when Josh read that book, he pointed at it and said, she's got boobs.
This is a callback heavy episode.
Look at that.
Look at what we can do when we cover just one Adventures in Odyssey episode.
I don't know what that was.
It's like an entirely different kind of show altogether.
It's like an entirely different kind of show.
An entirely different show.
No, God.
Jesus.
So I, just to go back to the Socialist Shelf episode for a second.
Please.
Um, I, we talked so much about the assumptions of people like Richard DeVos.
Yeah.
Um, who is, it's hard with this guy and it's similar with Focus on the Family to tell how
much of it is them being genuinely ignorant versus being willfully disingenuous.
Right.
Right.
The line is very, very fuzzy because you can have in like in, for instance, one of his
books, Richard DeVos talks about how like, oh yeah, here's all of these great people who
were able to make a bunch of money, uh, by using Amway.
Like all of these guys who played for the Baltimore Colts because like he had a personal
connection with like one or two of the players.
And so then they all started selling Amway.
The players?
Yes.
Were they getting like money ball wages?
Were they?
I don't know.
I, I, I didn't look into it.
It's hard not to be romantic about Colt.
I didn't look into it too much, but like the reality of it was, you know, they got in
early and so they were toward the top of the pyramid.
Right.
Right.
And DeVos repeatedly uses these ideas of like, well, you, anybody can do it.
Uh, so long as you are beneficent with your resources.
Right.
Right.
And do a lot of charity.
Right.
Yeah.
And it's like, okay, that is your perspective, but genuinely do you understand what it's like
outside of that?
And do you genuinely believe that this compassionate capitalism is enough to change the world?
Yeah.
And if he genuinely doesn't understand what things are like for other people, if he thinks
that everybody has his own experience of life, then yeah, no, of course, of course that's
going to work because it worked so well for him.
Yeah.
And I feel like it's very similar in this moment, in this episode.
Yeah.
Do you know what I call that book?
No.
Cunt Passionate Capitalism.
I put cunt at the beginning of it.
Where the cum was.
Yeah.
I call it compassionate cunt-polism.
Can I talk about another missed opportunity here?
Uh, I don't understand why there's not a scene with Jason.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
He just might not have been there.
Hey, I watched your brother explode.
Right.
Like, that might have been a nice conversation to have with Edwin.
Well, and I think that's another big part of, like, why we were talking about how it's
like, oh, he could have been written out.
I think they're always doing that because this isn't a union show.
They're not doing normal contracts.
So they're kind of writing on, I don't know, contingency.
It's like, well, maybe we'll get Earl back.
Maybe we won't.
It depends on what we're going to be able to do next year.
And so sometimes, yeah, Jason's just not there.
Who knows why?
It wasn't Jason who watched Regis explode.
It was Jack.
It was Jack.
And Jack and Edwin do talk.
And they don't talk about it at all.
No.
Yeah, that's so strange.
You're right.
Sorry.
I actually, I remember Darkness Before Dawn in our fixed version where it was Jason and
not Jack.
No, it was Jack.
And they don't even talk about it.
No.
Yeah, that's very strange.
And that would be interesting because, like, we don't know how Edwin found out his brother
died.
Right.
It seems like it's being introduced to him for the first time.
The lawyer saying, you know, he and your brother were involved in some kind of scandal
referring to Bart.
But like, yeah, having Edwin actually come back and learn everything has a lot more dramatic
heft, especially since your central conceit just doesn't have anything else going on.
Mm hmm.
The other thing that you could do is have people in Odyssey who are genuinely mad at Edwin Blackard.
Yes.
Right.
Yes.
Yes.
People have enough reason to go on because he he works at the the the fucking Harlequin
Theater that is also owned by Regis.
The moment Regis shows up, Edwin skips town.
Yeah.
What's going on there?
That's a little screwy.
Right.
Remember when Jason had his whole like taped confession?
Yeah.
Whatever.
That was at the theater.
You can't hide.
Stay on your toes, doc.
Like they they may have good reason to suspect that Edwin was in cahoots with Regis.
Like he might.
Yes.
And they could be wrong.
Right.
But like, I guess they kind of did that beat already in the episode where Connie like just
suspected him by virtue of being a blaggard.
But like you could add texture to it.
You could do something there.
Yeah.
You could do it a new way.
Yeah.
You could you could have some some some kind of obstacle for the character rather than everyone
in town just being like, it's fine, Edwin.
We all love Jesus.
We know you didn't do anything wrong.
Because it puts the onus on on Edwin to his internal conflict to carry the episode.
But they don't have a strong enough internal conflict to carry the episode because he doesn't
like they don't give a good enough rationale for why he feels as guilty as he does.
He would have had to have actually have done something and to be as guilty.
And you could even you that.
OK, that's another thing you could do.
You could raise something that maybe we didn't actually see that like when he left, he abandoned
this.
He set three people's houses on fire.
They hit four horses on the way out of town.
Maybe we didn't get the full story about what was going on with him.
And then we learn through Shakespeare being like, well, sir, did you remember that?
Right.
Like there's so many ways that you can make this better.
Yeah.
Right.
But that would betray the two central concepts of this episode.
One, the Christians are an incredibly forgiving people.
Right.
Which famously famously.
And two, that it is it is Edwin's own self-flagellation.
That is the problem.
Yeah.
He's being too Catholic about it.
Well, and I think the other thing that they have here is that Edwin doesn't know how to
relate to other people.
Like there's a genuine insight here because Edwin's idea of making it up to the town is
opening up the electric palace and just giving everything away for free.
Which is actually also kind of interesting, I think.
It should be.
But then for some reason, it's just not.
You know, because it's undone.
It's also undone.
It's undone.
But also like you do something like that.
It's just chaos.
Right.
And someone's going to take advantage of it and walk out with all the merchandise and
like people are going to get into fistfights.
It's going to like the police are going to get called.
Right.
So then you're actually making something worse in the attempt of making something better.
But not an odyssey.
An odyssey like everybody shows up for this for the clearance sale.
Yeah.
Everyone takes their five objects and leaves.
That's right.
Except for the Rathbones who, of course, take more.
Yeah.
Right.
It's just not.
Yeah.
It's not anything.
Well, it doesn't mean anything to Edwin.
And that's the important thing.
True.
Right.
If he had actually been giving away like his most prized possessions, I think that would
be more interesting because then when they're returned at the end, then it's like, oh my
God, the kindness of these people.
You're right.
Yeah.
It's just merchandise.
He actively hates it.
He doesn't give a shit about it.
That's right.
Yeah.
But like what if it was, you know, oh, the town, in order to make it up to them, I must distribute
all of my playbills and my precious theatrical items.
And all of my skulls.
Oh, his reviews.
His reviews.
That's right.
Have him give away the reviews.
Or like, oh my God.
Like life-size portraits of himself and shit.
Yes.
Which means so much to him and mean nothing to anyone else.
Right.
Or like have all of this part of, you know, be part of some Brewster's Million scheme
where he's getting rid of the Electric Palace and then he's able to like, then he has a
bunch of money or something left over and then Jack's like, well, what are you going to do?
And then he realizes, oh, I can make something.
In the same way that Witt bought the Fillmore Recreation Center.
Mm-hmm.
Like I can make something that ends up being a resource for the community rather than just
some retail business.
I like the idea of him giving away the reviews and people take them out of a sense of obligation
and then they come and give them back because they don't actually want them.
But then that can balance the line too between like, this guy is kind of annoying, but him
feeling good still matters to us.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And you kind of kill two birds with one stone.
Yeah.
You kind of keep him in his delusion that they're like, wow.
Yeah.
This was the one from Ben Brantley.
I would really love it if it was, he gave away all these reviews and all like his theatrical
things or whatever.
And then he had like a diamond, like a multi-million dollar diamond that one person gets.
And so everyone has to return the items at the end.
But the one guy's like, no, no, this is my diet.
My kids are going to college.
Give it back.
Yeah.
And something else worth noticing, there's not a single child in this episode.
That's true.
That's why it rules.
And you start to see more of this at this, in this, in the post house myth era, you start
to get episodes that are kid centric and then episodes that are just about the adult sitting
around and explaining things to each other, which as a kid feels great.
It kind of feels like you're being let in on this world that you're not allowed to be
a part of yet.
Right.
They're tapping into like, I guess one of them had to have listened to a child at some
point.
I mean, because they start leaning into the things that kids actually want to listen to.
The best episodes are the ones where it's the adults without the kids and they're actually
doing things.
Yeah.
And it does happen.
We are going to get some more of those episodes as Wits Endless Summer continues.
It's an exorable March.
So the summer will be endless until morale improves.
Yeah.
So Edwin, you know, he's emptied out the palace.
He gets called over to Wits End and he's met with a surprise party where everyone gives
everything back.
Jack and I called up a few folks we know and they went door to door collecting the stuff.
When everyone realized why you gave everything away, they knew they couldn't keep it.
So nearly everyone gave it back.
It's an odyssey.
Nearly.
It ain't fair, I tell ya.
First I have the stuff, then I don't, then I have it again, and now I don't again.
We actually found most of the merchandise over the Rathbun house.
Well, you just can't blame us for trying.
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
That sure is the situation.
And then Edwin is like, to reward all of you, I'm going to start doing my Hamlet.
And he starts with to be or not to be.
Yeah.
It's the first quarto.
Come on.
I'm so mad.
But I love, I love that, like.
Wait, no, our listeners need to know.
So to be or not to be happens in act three, scene one.
I'm going to go make a sandwich.
It's halfway through the play.
But if you do the first quarto of Hamlet, it happens in the equivalent of act two, scene two.
It's still not the beginning.
No, it's not.
I was making a comic exaggeration, Josh.
But another fun thing about the first quarto of Hamlet, this was the first edition that was ever published.
And it's published in quarto form, which is a half size of a regular book.
Wow, this is fun.
It's not a fourth?
It's not a fourth?
It was not.
No, it's not a fourth.
Because so when you have a book, right, you open it up and you've got a page on the left and the right.
Brian's quarto corner.
So each page is really, it's two pages on one big sheet of paper.
Right.
So it's folded in half.
Right.
Brian is showing us nudes.
Yes.
Right now.
And a quarto, therefore, is made from the same sheet of paper, but it's folded into fourths.
And then they cut along the top.
Right.
So that's what makes it a quarto.
So the first quarto was also not published with act headings.
It's just a number of scenes in order.
So it's like you could get up to like scene 36 or 37.
Whatever.
Yeah, I don't remember what the full.
It doesn't like restart with like one.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay.
The other thing that's worth noting is that when you perform something from that edition,
it's generally referred to as playing as quarto.
Whoa.
Are you excited?
So, yeah, the first quarto, I've made this reference before, but to be or not to be starts
with to be or not to be.
I, there's the point.
Aha.
Yeah.
But when Benedict Cumberbatch.
What is Polonius' weird name?
Oh, Karambus.
Karambus, thank you.
When Benedict Cumberbatch did Hamlet, they actually, in previews, did do to be or not to
be right at the top of the show.
And then I guess some people got mad, so they changed it.
Cowards.
Stick to your guns.
Well, I mean, I think it was probably because he did it and then everyone left.
Because they're like, well, we saw it.
We saw the thing.
We saw him do the thing.
That's why if you really want to do like a real production of Hamlet, get the haters
all riled up, but actually get people interested in the story, you cut it.
You cut to be or not to be.
You don't do it.
Straight up fucking get rid of it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And then as they're leaving the theater, you know, when you're handing out like programs
at the end of the night or whatever, because you've secretly brought on like a 96
person cast in the middle that didn't get credit in the initial one.
You want to retain the surprise.
Yeah, because it's the national theater.
All 96 of those guys start doing to be or not to be at once.
Yeah, because it's a flash mob.
Yeah.
I will say this.
So I wanted to just for a moment, as long as we're talking about Hamlet.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just kind of because we'll never do that again.
We will never talk about Hamlet.
Famously not.
Just kind of tease out the scene where Jack is talking to Edwin about Hamlet's guilt.
Yeah.
Listen to this analysis.
Listen.
So I didn't clip it.
So we're going to just talk about it.
Imagine that you're listening to this analysis.
Yeah.
Think when we talk of analyses that you hear them.
That's from Henry V, by the way.
That's basically Jack here.
And Jack at this point is sort of being Phil Lawler stand in.
Yeah.
Says that Hamlet's guilt primarily comes from within himself.
Yeah.
That he feels guilt that he couldn't stop the death of his father.
In that, you know, the first step for Hamlet toward getting better would be to forgive himself.
Yeah.
Which, of course, famously happens at the end of Hamlet.
He forgives himself.
And it's happily ever after.
He's saying, right, like that's the thing is if Hamlet only forgave himself, then everyone wouldn't have died.
Hamlet, which like Hamlet met his dad after his dad died.
Well, I don't think, you know, I don't think he's including King Hamlet.
I think he means everybody else.
And this.
No, no, no.
What I mean is that Hamlet's not being driven by internal guilt.
He's being driven by his dad meeting him and saying, I'm in hell right now.
That's right.
I'm the ghost of your dad.
You need to fix this.
That's true.
Yes, yes, yes.
It is.
Here's what I will say.
Lawler gives himself a very fascinating out here.
Yeah.
Which is that Jack read it for the first time on the walkover.
On the way over?
Yeah.
That's a weird.
Where does Jack live?
He's got to be careful.
That bus is careening out of control.
He's just got his face down in a book the whole time.
Yeah, he's just reading that first quarto.
Playing?
As quarto, even?
That is the point.
Who can say?
There is the point.
Who are these quartos coming down?
Whose quartos are they?
I'm a quarto.
It's a meme.
And then quarto is like, you need to activate the reactor.
Right?
Quarto?
What?
Like quato from Total Recall.
That was a bad one.
I didn't have the exact quote.
Sorry.
I still want to do a Total Recall episode.
I didn't have the exact quato.
Quoto.
Oh.
Woo-hoo.
That was a treat for me.
You played with it, though.
That was a treat.
You might not have had it, but you played with Quoto.
Oh, that was a treat.
But yeah, no.
So he didn't really, like, I think he's given himself a nice out there for being like, I
did not understand Hamlet.
Here's my explanation of Hamlet.
Well, okay.
So to defend this, I think that there absolutely is a component of Hamlet's neurosis that is
driven by his guilt and shame.
Yeah.
That is very explicit in the text.
Yeah.
But it's less about being able to stop his dad's death, right?
Because that's, I mean, maybe partially, but it's mostly because he didn't have a good
relationship with his dad.
Sure.
Oh, you're saying that it wasn't his failure to prevent the death that's driving him crazy.
Yeah.
It wasn't like if had he been there, he would have, like, knocked the poison out of Claudius'
hand or whatever.
It was just that he wasn't the son that King Hamlet wanted him to be.
And now he finally gets the opportunity to do that, to please Papa.
Well, and I think, too, if you go down that road too far, you end up leaning too much into
the melancholy of the melancholy Dane.
And then that, of course, throws out the fact that he kind of knows what his game is on some
level.
I really think that, like, he's melancholy in the first act.
And then he's got some shit to do after that.
That's right.
Yeah.
That's right.
He doesn't even have to keep wearing black.
He's got a little project.
Yeah.
Because then, to be or not to be becomes a thesis statement where he's saying, you know,
I could, like, it's him making up his mind, essentially.
He's saying, I could fuck around and kill myself.
Or I could find out.
But I could find out and I'm going to.
Yeah.
You know?
Or you could cut it.
You could just get rid of it.
You could just go straight into Nymph in Thy Orisons, man.
Yeah.
So, anyway, that's it for that episode, pretty much.
I think the audience would riot if you cut, if you actually cut to be or not to be.
Let them!
Do I look like I give a fuck?
He doesn't.
I am the most dangerous voice in the American theater today.
Give me a fucking job.
No, no, he's the most dangerous voice.
Well, I'm Swedish.
He's the most Swedish.
Yeah.
He's downright Swedish.
Swedish.
Swedish Todd.
I always loved playing Swedish in the arcade next to Tempest.
Based on William Shakespeare's The Tempest.
Oh, no!
Isn't that the one that the CIA put in there to, like, drive you insane?
No, that's Polybius.
Polybius, which does not exist.
That's not a real game that everyone's made.
What's that?
I thought you were making a Gradius reference, Brian.
You were specifically shouting out.
Xevious is what I was trying to do.
Xevious.
Wasn't Polybius Polonius' name in the second quarter?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I actually saw a Polybius machine in real life, which was kind of fun.
Yeah, people have done it, yeah.
Yeah, there's one in Grand Rapids, actually.
There's a record store that has one.
That's fun.
Is that, like, made recently?
Or was it based on an actual cabinet?
I think there are actually a few people who have made Polybius games.
Oh, but if your question is, is it a custom build or, like, repurposing an existing game?
I don't know.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I didn't actually, I don't think, I don't even know if it was a functional game.
It's just Pac-Man, but he has a weird hat.
Hello, I'm Polybius.
I'm gonna eat some balls.
Keep going.
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.
No, keep going, keep going.
I need to hear more about this, guys.
Oh, look at these vegetables.
I'm going to put these vegetables in my mouth, and then everything goes whoop, whoop.
And then all of the zambos, I go by, and I nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, on the zambos.
What kind of accent is this?
He's getting increasingly German.
It is the Polybius accent from the Polybius region of Germany.
Okay.
Where I was made by the CIA to control your mind.
Oh, okay.
This is exactly how the Greek philosopher Polybius actually sounded.
I feel like he got a little bit Austrian toward there, too.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, definitely.
No, you were shoving pastries in your mouth.
Anyway.
I love it.
The episode, I should note, ends with Chris basically being like, if you don't forgive
yourself, you are spitting in God's face.
Well, they did.
You know, this is another.
More things to feel guilty about.
Well, again, it's like, don't be a fucking Catholic about it.
Yeah.
You know, figure it out or pull it together.
But what you shouldn't do is wear it so hard on yourself, you dumb bitch.
Yeah.
Don't talk about it.
Unless, of course.
They don't cite the Bible in the episode, right?
They only cite Shakespeare, which is almost a clever thing for Phil Lawler to do.
It's clever by his standards.
Yeah.
Right.
Because it's like they're meeting Edwin where he's at.
It's like, we're just going to do Hamlet.
So, yeah, they have to give Chris the Bible verse that's like, you gotta forgive yourself.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Anyway.
That's a...
It was fun.
I mean, I had fun with this episode.
I know we really went hard on it, but like, I...
It's a contractual obligation.
It's an enjoyable listen.
Yeah.
We're required to do that.
But like, no, I really had a lot of fun listening to this episode.
And again, it was mostly because of the performance.
Yes.
Yeah.
And it's great to listen to this and be like, oh yeah, no, they did have it.
You know, this is why we're talking about this show is because like there is actual talent
here.
And there is a degree of, and I really hate to hand it to Lawler on this one, but there
is a degree of intelligence in the writing.
Yeah.
Or at least attempt at intelligence that you don't normally find in children's media and especially
Christian children's media.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um, yeah.
Yeah.
Which again, grading on a curve.
Yeah, of course.
You know, but yeah, again, this is one, this is like, this is one I would say that if I
were to introduce somebody to Odyssey, I would say Monty's Christmas obviously be the first
one.
But I think the second one I'd have him listen to is probably this one.
Yeah.
Even with all the lore, I feel like this one just has so much shit up top.
I mean, I mean, kind of, but it's carried by Edwin in such a way that it's just like,
oh, something bad must happen.
And then that's the hook, right?
It's like, well, what happened with his brother?
And then that's what gets you in to go and re-listen to all the stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then, uh, we would also put in the 40 minute long, uh, interstitial from Darkness
Before Dawn or from Our Darkness Before Dawn.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
That'll, that'll be, uh, that, that, I think that would be the, the, the easiest on ramp to
Odyssey is my final 40 minute interstitial that has nothing to do.
Okay.
So here's something that I actually have seen.
I have seen a number of people be like, if you're going to start anywhere, start with
Brian's 20 minute monologue.
I shit you not.
Oh, with our show?
For our show?
Yeah.
Because it's got all of the exposition in it.
Yeah.
It gives you everything you need to know about the lore.
Yeah.
For, uh, and this is, this is, you were talking the Devin episode.
Yeah.
We're talking, uh, Black and Begins.
Black and Begins.
With my Fantasia.
Man, I listened to that fucking thing because I, working on getting the tapes made for the auction,
I had to test it a lot.
I had to do a lot of little test episodes, you know, try different tapes and things like
that.
Get the sound somewhere passable.
And I listened to that fucking one man show so many goddamn times.
I never want to hear it again.
I'm going to, I'm going to play it one time.
I'm going to break into your apartment and just hide a speaker somewhere.
What do you think you're going to accomplish, AJ?
I'm already dead inside.
I'm going to stand outside his window, like say everything with the boombox.
Say everything.
Say everything.
Say anything.
Whatever.
The little known sequel.
I'm tired.
Leave me alone.
Um, we hope you've enjoyed this Bobas, everyone.
Um, thank you all for, uh, your ongoing support of our show, of the Patreon, et cetera.
Um, yeah.
She's got Bobas.
Oh boy.
That's it.
I don't, I don't.
That's it.
Yeah.
Okay.
That's it.
That's it.
Bye.
Just cut it there.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
