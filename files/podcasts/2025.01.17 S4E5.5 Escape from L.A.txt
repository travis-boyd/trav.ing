0.00 13.62 SPEAKER_03  Hello, listeners. The following episode, Escape from L.A., was recorded at a different time last week, before thousands of people actually had to escape from L.A., owing to the devastating fires currently sweeping the city.
13.76 26.08 SPEAKER_03  The climax of the film shows an iconic Los Angeles landmark on fire, and the host's remarks that this is sick nasty and rules should be understood in their historical context.
26.08 33.22 SPEAKER_03  In all seriousness, though, we are very happy to say that our guest for this episode, Morgana Ignis, is alive and safe at time of recording.
33.70 46.78 SPEAKER_03  We'll be providing a link in the show notes to an organization called Direct Relief, who are giving emergency medical aid, respirators, and other critical suppliers to the affected communities, should you feel compelled to donate and help the people of Los Angeles.
47.16 51.46 SPEAKER_00  Because you may have survived Cleveland. You may have escaped from New York.
51.46 60.44 SPEAKER_00  But this is L.A., vato. And you're about to find out that this fucking city can kill anybody!
60.44 83.02 SPEAKER_06  Hello and welcome to another bonus episode of Kill James Bond.
83.26 88.14 SPEAKER_06  I am November Kelly, joined, as always, by my friends Abigail Thorne and Devon.
88.52 89.00 SPEAKER_03  Hey!
89.00 90.18 SPEAKER_06  Kept you waiting, huh?
90.44 100.06 SPEAKER_06  And we have a very special guest. We are joined by actress Morgana Ignis from Class Act's Hell of a Boss and Dracula's ex-girlfriend.
100.40 101.22 SPEAKER_06  Morgana, how's it going?
101.28 111.90 SPEAKER_04  It is, look, given the current situation of the entire world, which is entirely too relevant to this fucking film, I'm great. Never been better. Fantastic, really.
114.54 119.06 SPEAKER_02  We're all feeling good. We're feeling healthy. Our hoi-oid bones are intact.
119.06 120.58 SPEAKER_02  Yes. We've watched a movie.
120.58 122.66 SPEAKER_06  And that's still legal. This was Abby's pick.
122.66 123.16 SPEAKER_06  Amazing.
123.16 125.44 SPEAKER_06  It's still legal.
125.44 128.06 SPEAKER_06  Go to the movies, watch them while you still can.
128.06 139.68 SPEAKER_03  Yeah. I first watched this movie on a couch, uh, full of clouted up transsexuals, uh, very high on weed gummies, in L.A., and it was that couch that is just to Morgana's right right now.
139.68 144.96 SPEAKER_03  Because she was the one who introduced me to this movie, and you, me, and Laura watched it when we were high as balls, and it was great.
144.96 145.28 SPEAKER_03  Hell yes.
145.28 148.16 SPEAKER_02  That's the registered way to watch a movie. That's the recommended.
148.16 156.80 SPEAKER_04  I believe that there were no less than 20 to 30 times that you said during this film, this might be the greatest movie ever made.
156.80 157.28 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
157.28 158.32 SPEAKER_01  And you were right.
158.32 158.72 SPEAKER_01  It's fantastic.
158.72 159.84 SPEAKER_01  Each of those times.
159.84 161.76 SPEAKER_06  That was my experience as well, yeah.
161.76 162.80 SPEAKER_06  Like, film criticism.
163.06 171.94 SPEAKER_06  And the thing is, we're doing this thing that we do on this podcast of coming in in the second part of a series again, because I haven't seen Escape from New York.
171.94 176.34 SPEAKER_06  We haven't, certainly haven't talked about Escape from New York. Doesn't matter.
176.34 186.10 SPEAKER_03  So, I have, and I watched Escape from New York for the first time, um, on a couch with one extremely clouted up transsexual, when I was still in the closet.
186.10 190.74 SPEAKER_03  We were dating at the time, and we were waiting for her Viagra to kick in, and we watched Escape from New York.
190.74 193.30 SPEAKER_04  How long does Viagra take to kick in?
193.30 195.86 SPEAKER_04  Let me tell you one thing about Escape from New York.
195.86 199.22 SPEAKER_04  If you're watching Escape from New York, you don't need Viagra, baby.
199.22 202.26 SPEAKER_04  You are ready to fucking go after watching that movie.
202.26 203.30 SPEAKER_06  That's fucking right.
203.30 206.90 SPEAKER_06  You're just trying to get topped, and she's like, kept you waiting, huh?
209.78 211.62 SPEAKER_03  Oh no, I was doing the top.
211.62 212.26 SPEAKER_06  Doesn't matter.
212.26 216.34 SPEAKER_06  I was, I just, I'm here to make Metal Gear references.
216.34 219.94 SPEAKER_06  Rad as hell, ready to go, but I'm like, hang on, hang on, I'm watching this fucking movie.
219.94 221.54 SPEAKER_06  Well, here's how he escapes from New York.
221.54 224.98 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, I'm just invested in the story of Snake Plissken.
224.98 230.02 SPEAKER_04  Okay, here's the thing to keep in mind about Escape from LA versus Escape from New York.
230.02 235.30 SPEAKER_04  So both written, directed, scored everything by John Carpenter.
235.54 239.46 SPEAKER_04  Escape from New York, significantly better reviews than this film.
239.78 243.78 SPEAKER_04  John Carpenter has come out and said, those are incorrect.
244.34 249.06 SPEAKER_04  He is not even like, John Carpenter is not somebody who respects that someone might have a different opinion.
249.06 254.90 SPEAKER_04  He has literally come out in the record and said, anybody who does not love this film is just objectively wrong.
254.90 258.02 SPEAKER_04  And this is the better film of the two.
258.02 263.78 SPEAKER_04  I love John Carpenter for many reasons, including him saying he doesn't really want to make films anymore.
263.78 266.98 SPEAKER_04  He just wants to play video games and smoke weed all day, which I respect.
266.98 267.86 SPEAKER_04  Hell yeah.
267.86 274.10 SPEAKER_04  But the fact that he, like, after this movie kind of got review bombed, wrongfully so.
274.10 277.30 SPEAKER_04  John Carpenter came out and said, yeah, those reviews are just incorrect.
277.30 279.14 SPEAKER_04  It's not a matter of opinion.
279.14 280.42 SPEAKER_04  It's simply wrong.
280.42 282.98 SPEAKER_04  This is an amazing film and should get more respect.
282.98 283.38 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
283.38 283.54 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
283.54 287.70 SPEAKER_06  Refute your critics in the year of our Lord 2025.
287.70 291.78 SPEAKER_06  Refute your critics by being like, no, this one's good, actually.
291.78 296.74 SPEAKER_06  And the thing about this movie is, like, I have two, I have a dialectic going on.
296.74 298.42 SPEAKER_06  I have two opinions about this movie.
298.42 302.58 SPEAKER_06  One is that it's like, kind of morally, like, wrong.
302.58 304.98 SPEAKER_06  And the other is that it's fantastic.
304.98 306.82 SPEAKER_06  It whips.
306.82 309.22 SPEAKER_06  Like, I had a great time watching this one.
309.22 311.38 SPEAKER_06  It is kind of reprehensible.
311.38 312.02 SPEAKER_06  Yes, because fuck.
312.02 312.50 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
312.50 313.06 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
313.06 313.62 SPEAKER_02  It rules.
313.62 314.10 SPEAKER_02  Yes.
314.10 317.78 SPEAKER_02  It sucks just enough to be perfect.
317.78 321.62 SPEAKER_02  Like, there has to be that vital suck component for it to properly rule.
321.62 324.34 SPEAKER_06  It's the seed pearl in an oyster, you know?
324.34 326.18 SPEAKER_06  There has to be that little bit of...
326.18 331.78 SPEAKER_04  It fucking gloriously sucks in the best way as possible.
331.78 333.38 SPEAKER_02  It's so good, man.
333.38 337.38 SPEAKER_02  I owe Abby basically my biggest apology of my professional career.
337.38 340.98 SPEAKER_02  Because, like, when you were like, oh, let's go watch Escape from New York with Morgana.
340.98 345.94 SPEAKER_02  I was gonna be like, okay, this is gonna be a vehicle to hear about the time that you spent in LA, right?
346.58 348.90 SPEAKER_02  But this movie fucking rules.
348.90 351.62 SPEAKER_02  I'm so happy that you made me watch this.
351.62 354.82 SPEAKER_02  I'm like, fully, I'm on both knees, hat in hand.
354.82 356.02 SPEAKER_02  I'm so sorry.
356.02 356.66 SPEAKER_02  Thank you.
356.66 357.94 SPEAKER_02  I wouldn't bring you a duffer.
357.94 358.58 SPEAKER_03  It's all killer.
358.58 359.30 SPEAKER_03  Don't feel it with me.
359.30 359.78 SPEAKER_02  It's all killer, baby.
359.78 361.78 SPEAKER_03  So this movie was made in 1996.
361.78 364.74 SPEAKER_03  It's set in the futuristic year of 2013.
364.74 365.46 SPEAKER_03  Mmm.
365.46 367.94 SPEAKER_03  And so we have a bit of build up.
367.94 370.02 SPEAKER_03  But first of all, we get the sickest title sequence in the world.
370.02 375.46 SPEAKER_06  Well, first of all, we get the title sequence in the Law and Order font, which is disorienting.
375.46 381.22 SPEAKER_06  Introducing the fact that Kurt Russell, Walt Disney's last words, is gonna be in this movie.
382.66 385.94 SPEAKER_06  And Pam Greer is in this movie.
385.94 387.62 SPEAKER_06  Steve Buscemi is in this movie.
387.62 388.18 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
388.18 389.54 SPEAKER_06  Pam Greer is in this movie.
389.54 391.94 SPEAKER_06  Promises a lot, and believe me, it delivers.
391.94 394.26 SPEAKER_04  Bruce fucking Campbell is in this film.
394.26 395.38 SPEAKER_02  Bruce fucking Campbell.
395.38 395.78 SPEAKER_02  Yes.
395.78 396.42 SPEAKER_04  Bruce Campbell's in this film.
396.42 397.06 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
397.06 402.18 SPEAKER_02  This is gonna be one of those Kill James Bond reviews where I say a lot of people's names reverently.
402.18 402.66 SPEAKER_02  But so...
402.66 404.82 SPEAKER_04  I'm gonna be like, oh my god!
404.82 408.66 SPEAKER_04  I will also be remiss if I don't mention during this opening.
408.66 411.38 SPEAKER_04  Again, there's so much to talk about before the movie even begins.
411.38 412.50 SPEAKER_04  I should say everything.
413.14 423.94 SPEAKER_04  The iconic score, the iconic opening music that continues from Escape from New York, same music from that one, scored by John Carpenter.
423.94 432.02 SPEAKER_04  This music, if you are into cyberpunk sort of dystopian future aesthetic, this is your theme.
432.02 432.90 SPEAKER_04  I had this.
432.90 433.30 SPEAKER_04  Get this.
433.30 436.74 SPEAKER_04  I had this on my middle school iPod.
436.74 439.30 SPEAKER_04  I have it on my gym playlist now.
439.30 440.58 SPEAKER_03  I was doing chest and tricep data.
440.58 441.70 SPEAKER_06  Just getting like pumped up.
441.70 442.90 SPEAKER_06  You need to get ready.
442.90 443.86 SPEAKER_03  You better add it to mine.
443.86 446.98 SPEAKER_06  The deal is, right, America has fallen to fascism.
446.98 449.70 SPEAKER_06  And in the movie, America has fallen to fascism.
449.70 451.14 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, the deal is this.
451.14 455.38 SPEAKER_04  The city of Los Angeles is ravaged by crime and immorality.
456.18 459.38 SPEAKER_02  So it's set in a very equivalent timeline to our own.
459.38 460.66 SPEAKER_02  Pure fantasy.
460.66 463.78 SPEAKER_02  Nothing that we could relate to at all so far, obviously.
463.78 464.50 SPEAKER_02  It's a stretch.
464.50 470.74 SPEAKER_02  A presidential candidate in like 1998 predicted that in the year 2000, the big one would happen.
470.74 477.54 SPEAKER_06  But by the way, this like presidential candidate, what they're doing is Pat Buchanan, right?
477.54 482.82 SPEAKER_06  Who was this like even further right kind of like third party candidate.
482.82 487.54 SPEAKER_06  I think he ran for the reform party a bunch of times, but was doing all of this like Christian nationalist shit.
487.54 500.18 SPEAKER_06  And it's sort of like extrapolating from the kind of like urban decay thinking about LA in the 90s and Pat Buchanan running to be like, well, how does this play out?
500.18 501.06 SPEAKER_06  And the answer is...
501.06 501.62 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
501.62 503.78 SPEAKER_02  And he like basically gets it right.
503.78 504.18 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
504.18 507.94 SPEAKER_02  So in the year 2000, the big one does hit and he gets sworn in as president for life.
507.94 512.74 SPEAKER_06  It even looks a bit like Trump when Trump's doing his like tough guy face.
512.74 514.74 SPEAKER_06  It's really kind of remarkable.
514.74 517.86 SPEAKER_04  No, we noticed that when we watched it the first time.
517.86 521.06 SPEAKER_04  I didn't think about that initially.
521.06 526.18 SPEAKER_04  And then going into it, given just how much we've seen that face of Trump around.
526.18 526.66 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
526.66 528.42 SPEAKER_04  I'm like, okay, this is hitting way too close.
528.42 534.02 SPEAKER_04  So the hair, the hair is kind of unrealistic on a human creature.
534.74 536.58 SPEAKER_04  It's way too reminiscent.
536.58 538.74 SPEAKER_02  This is Cliff Robertson playing the president.
538.74 540.50 SPEAKER_02  They don't bother naming him any further.
540.50 541.78 SPEAKER_02  He's just called president the whole time.
541.78 551.06 SPEAKER_03  The earthquake causes LA to like, some of it sinks into the sea, but now there's like an island as the island of Los Angeles, which is now one giant concentration camp for non-citizens.
551.06 558.66 SPEAKER_03  And if you break the new moral Christian laws in the United States, you are instantly deported without trial to LA Island.
558.66 560.66 SPEAKER_03  So there is no escape from LA.
560.66 561.78 SPEAKER_02  Well, indeed.
561.78 563.70 SPEAKER_03  Making any escape from LA impossible.
563.70 564.82 SPEAKER_03  Exactly.
564.82 572.50 SPEAKER_06  You get exiled by this paramilitary, like fascist police force, the United States police force.
572.50 579.22 SPEAKER_06  And the vibe here is all like black visors and like black Humvees and like CGI Comanche helicopters.
579.22 584.74 SPEAKER_06  Is it such a like a particular- Way less militarized than the actual police right now.
584.74 584.90 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
584.90 585.22 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
585.22 588.02 SPEAKER_06  It's such a particular vision of American fascism.
588.02 592.10 SPEAKER_06  And it reminds me of another great piece of American sci-fi, Terminator 2, right?
592.10 604.02 SPEAKER_06  Where making the Terminator 2 in Terminator 2 like an LAPD officer, because the LAPD is so obviously like fascist robots.
604.02 614.58 SPEAKER_06  In the same way, being like, oh, this like fascist paramilitary force that's like cordoned off Los Angeles, all wearing black and like driving around in Humvees and shit.
614.58 617.14 SPEAKER_06  And it's like, that's just the LAPD.
617.14 617.62 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
617.62 618.82 SPEAKER_03  Robocop 2 did this too.
618.82 622.90 SPEAKER_02  It's like, it's why the protagonist of Demolition Man is an LAPD officer.
622.90 627.86 SPEAKER_04  And of course, the first Terminator film, also directed by John Carpenter.
627.86 633.38 SPEAKER_04  So he had a vision for what the future was going to look like.
634.02 639.54 SPEAKER_04  And I'm just, I'm so happy that he gets to live today to see his dreams come true.
639.54 642.02 SPEAKER_04  To see his vision for America.
642.02 642.98 SPEAKER_04  He's just watching that.
642.98 651.54 SPEAKER_06  I would also want to smoke weed and play video games all day if I had, in the 90s, been like, this is going to lead directly to the 2020s fascism and been right.
651.54 652.10 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
652.10 652.66 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
652.66 653.06 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
653.06 655.46 SPEAKER_02  He's just, he's just like, he's just sitting at home.
655.46 658.02 SPEAKER_02  He's getting his royalty checks from all the Halloween movies.
658.02 659.38 SPEAKER_02  Just like, why would you?
659.38 660.82 SPEAKER_02  Why would you do anything out of this smoke weed?
660.82 664.34 SPEAKER_06  This armored car rolls in and there's a like huge press attention.
664.34 668.02 SPEAKER_06  There's a fun detail that the channel is the police channel, first of all.
668.02 670.02 SPEAKER_06  But they're also carrying prime news.
670.02 673.86 SPEAKER_06  And I was watching this on Amazon and I was like, interesting.
673.86 677.86 SPEAKER_03  And we meet the protagonist of our film, Devin.
677.86 679.62 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
679.62 682.34 SPEAKER_02  Snake Pisskink steps into fucking frame here.
682.34 683.14 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
683.14 684.18 SPEAKER_03  Pisskink.
684.18 685.30 SPEAKER_02  Kurt Russell, long hair.
685.30 693.78 SPEAKER_04  Looking at Devin right now, absolutely not a man who in any way, shape, or form was influenced by a Kurt Russell or Kurt Russell inspired character at all.
693.78 696.02 SPEAKER_04  Well indeed, not a man who was influenced at all, ever.
696.02 696.50 SPEAKER_03  Exactly.
696.50 697.46 SPEAKER_03  Just, let's just clip that.
697.46 698.50 SPEAKER_03  Absolutely not a man.
698.50 698.90 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
698.90 699.86 SPEAKER_02  Absolutely not a man.
699.86 701.78 SPEAKER_02  Well, in fact, I'm even dressed as him right now.
701.78 703.94 SPEAKER_02  I've got my camera trousers on.
703.94 708.82 SPEAKER_04  This is very much like you, you, you are like the ultimate snake blitzkin and cosplayer right now.
709.70 710.26 SPEAKER_02  Thank you.
710.26 712.90 SPEAKER_02  I put this on cause I was, I was having such fun with the movie.
714.10 718.10 SPEAKER_02  That's how you can tell if you've really got me as I start dressing like the characters in your movie.
718.10 719.22 SPEAKER_02  It's happened to Serpico.
719.94 721.14 SPEAKER_04  Can we also, can we also talk?
721.14 724.66 SPEAKER_04  Cause I'm sure you've been, you've probably connected to this.
724.66 738.66 SPEAKER_04  The amount of trans girls and non-binary people who absolutely idolized both Snake Blitzkin and Solid Snake Big Boss from the Metal Gear series.
738.66 738.98 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
738.98 739.06 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
739.06 739.62 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
739.62 740.58 SPEAKER_06  Mm-hmm.
740.58 743.38 SPEAKER_06  I'm just here to do my David Hater impression.
743.86 744.26 SPEAKER_06  Uh...
745.70 750.26 SPEAKER_06  Let the David Haters become your David Waters at the David Table of Success.
750.26 751.54 SPEAKER_03  David Table of David Success.
751.54 758.26 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, 100% every single trans girl who has gone through voice training today at one point
758.26 764.58 SPEAKER_05  was trying to get their voice to sound like this when they were a teenager, getting into that deep, gravelly voice.
764.58 765.70 SPEAKER_05  Hmm.
765.70 768.74 SPEAKER_05  Colonel, heat from fire, fire from heat.
768.74 773.78 SPEAKER_03  I played a character on Philosophy Tube who was inspired by the Metal Gear.
773.78 775.78 SPEAKER_04  Is that Plisskin?
775.78 782.02 SPEAKER_04  So I want to know what was the ingredient that took this hyper masculine character we're about to get into.
782.02 785.38 SPEAKER_04  And unlike, I think any other hyper masculine, I don't see this with anyone else.
785.38 788.26 SPEAKER_04  It's not like they did the same thing with like Arnold Schwarzenegger characters.
788.26 788.74 SPEAKER_04  No.
788.74 789.78 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, it's true.
789.78 798.74 SPEAKER_04  Plisskin specifically, whether or not it be the Kojima knockoff of Plisskin or the OG worshipped by the non-cis.
798.74 800.66 SPEAKER_03  I think it's because he's a blank slate.
800.66 805.86 SPEAKER_03  Like we don't really know anything about Snake other than like, he's ex Special Forces and he's the coolest guy around that he's got an eye patch.
805.86 806.18 SPEAKER_03  That's it.
806.18 806.90 SPEAKER_03  That's all we know.
806.90 810.50 SPEAKER_03  We don't need to know like where he got the eye patch or how he lost the eye.
810.50 812.82 SPEAKER_03  We don't need like snake origin story.
812.82 815.06 SPEAKER_03  It's just like, yeah, he's the coolest guy around that he wears leather.
815.06 815.46 SPEAKER_03  Fuck you.
815.46 816.42 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
816.42 818.42 SPEAKER_06  There's a kind of detachment as well.
818.42 820.18 SPEAKER_06  Like he's not having fun.
820.18 824.02 SPEAKER_06  Whereas a lot of like Schwarzenegger stuff, he's like enjoying it.
824.02 830.18 SPEAKER_06  And, or he's like kind of like grimly resolved for a snake or seems like above the thing.
830.18 831.86 SPEAKER_06  And so he gets brought in.
831.86 838.18 SPEAKER_06  He's like public enemy number one, uh, because he's been arrested in, please.
838.18 839.86 SPEAKER_06  God, I hope this is the right drop.
839.86 841.38 SPEAKER_01  New Vegas, Thailand.
841.38 843.62 SPEAKER_06  It's fine.
843.62 844.98 SPEAKER_06  I just didn't expect it to be.
844.98 846.58 SPEAKER_06  New Vegas mentioned.
846.58 849.86 SPEAKER_03  New Vegas, Thailand too.
849.86 852.58 SPEAKER_03  Like of course, that's where you would put like New Vegas.
852.58 856.26 SPEAKER_03  Cause you, you get, you get your pussy and then you go straight to New Vegas.
856.26 856.74 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
856.74 857.14 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
857.14 857.46 SPEAKER_03  Smart.
858.74 859.30 SPEAKER_03  Fantastic.
859.30 864.74 SPEAKER_06  Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter, but it's in the Mekong Delta.
864.74 866.34 SPEAKER_06  New Vegas.
866.34 866.90 SPEAKER_06  Sorry, Eccles.
866.90 871.54 SPEAKER_03  One of the goons who brings him in is Ensign Ro Laren from Star Trek.
871.54 872.42 SPEAKER_03  Good to see her again.
872.42 874.66 SPEAKER_03  Haven't seen her since the Cardassians pulled out of Bajor.
874.66 877.30 SPEAKER_03  There's a couple of Star Trek guys in there that I was excited to see.
877.30 877.86 SPEAKER_03  I do.
877.86 881.78 SPEAKER_06  I like New Vegas, Thailand is a piece of like world building, right?
881.78 886.82 SPEAKER_06  Because they really had a vision of how dumb US imperialism was going to get.
886.82 889.46 SPEAKER_06  Like it's like buying Greenland, right?
889.46 896.02 SPEAKER_06  So like, again, we're at a point where it's like, ah, shit, that's the John Carpenter future.
896.02 898.10 SPEAKER_06  We thought it was Alfonso Cuaron future.
898.10 899.62 SPEAKER_06  No, it's John Carpenter future.
899.62 907.22 SPEAKER_06  And like bits of this kind of feel like if you made Children of Men as an 80s action movie, this is what you would make.
907.22 907.62 SPEAKER_06  Hell yeah.
907.62 908.02 SPEAKER_06  Right?
908.02 909.78 SPEAKER_06  Listeners, Devin is putting on an eye patch.
909.78 910.74 SPEAKER_02  I just found my eye patch.
910.74 911.06 SPEAKER_02  I found it.
911.06 912.42 SPEAKER_02  I couldn't find it before the recording.
912.42 913.38 SPEAKER_02  And halfway through, I got struck.
913.38 914.66 SPEAKER_03  I couldn't find mine either.
914.66 915.54 SPEAKER_03  I'm sorry.
915.54 916.74 SPEAKER_02  Which fucking side is it on?
916.74 917.38 SPEAKER_02  Just keep, just keep.
917.38 927.78 SPEAKER_03  We also hear that some of the, as, as Snake is being marched through this, this base, we hear who else gets deported to LA and prostitutes, atheists, runaways.
927.78 928.82 SPEAKER_03  We're taking out the trash.
928.82 929.22 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
929.22 931.46 SPEAKER_06  For moral crimes.
931.46 931.94 SPEAKER_06  Right.
931.94 932.50 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
932.50 932.90 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
932.90 933.22 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
933.22 937.06 SPEAKER_03  Or you can repent and be executed immediately on the spot.
937.06 940.50 SPEAKER_03  So it's like, that's how bad LA is, is you can't just choose to be killed.
940.50 943.86 SPEAKER_04  And it's really anyone who's not a Christian, basically.
943.86 949.14 SPEAKER_04  Anyone who's not like a right wing Christian gets moved to LA, which is incorrect.
949.14 949.78 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
949.78 957.86 SPEAKER_06  Even the specific Protestantism of the fact that it's like pastors doing the electrocuting as well.
957.86 964.74 SPEAKER_06  But so, obviously they have brought Snake Plissken in to do another Escape from New York job.
964.74 965.22 SPEAKER_06  And so...
965.22 967.86 SPEAKER_02  They never much say the same thing to him.
967.86 970.26 SPEAKER_02  Like, you gotta get in there, full pardon.
970.26 972.34 SPEAKER_02  He's like, sounds familiar.
972.34 972.66 SPEAKER_02  You know?
972.66 973.94 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
973.94 974.66 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
974.66 978.90 SPEAKER_03  Because in Escape from New York, the president got stuck in New York, which was a crime island and he got him out of there.
978.90 979.86 SPEAKER_03  That's the plot of Escape from New York.
979.86 980.34 SPEAKER_03  Don't worry about it.
980.34 981.62 SPEAKER_06  The plot of this one is that...
981.62 982.50 SPEAKER_06  Not this president.
982.50 983.06 SPEAKER_03  Previous president.
983.06 988.10 SPEAKER_06  The president's daughter has become self-radicalized on an online MMO.
988.10 988.66 SPEAKER_06  It happens.
988.66 990.42 SPEAKER_03  She's been groomed online in chat rooms.
990.42 992.42 SPEAKER_03  She's been in racial chat rooms showing feet.
992.42 993.86 SPEAKER_03  She's gone woke.
993.86 995.06 SPEAKER_03  She's gone fully woke.
995.06 995.46 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
995.46 995.86 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
995.86 998.42 SPEAKER_06  She's been groomed by Che Guevara.
998.42 999.14 SPEAKER_06  Except Che Guevara...
999.14 999.78 SPEAKER_01  Yes, indeed.
999.78 1003.14 SPEAKER_06  ...Guervo Jones is...
1003.14 1005.22 SPEAKER_06  So, like, he's...
1005.22 1006.42 SPEAKER_06  Welsh, weirdly.
1006.42 1013.38 SPEAKER_06  There's a combination of racial anxiety here, because he's both a gang leader and a communist guerrilla.
1013.38 1014.34 SPEAKER_03  Mm-hmm.
1014.34 1017.38 SPEAKER_03  Specifically communist, too, because he's a member of Shining Path.
1017.38 1019.70 SPEAKER_03  He's a member of the Shining Path.
1019.70 1020.82 SPEAKER_03  Real organization.
1020.82 1022.26 SPEAKER_03  Real organization.
1022.26 1022.98 SPEAKER_03  Real life.
1022.98 1025.22 SPEAKER_06  I almost fell out of my fucking chair.
1025.22 1027.22 SPEAKER_06  The Peruvian Maoists.
1027.78 1029.38 SPEAKER_06  Like, it's such a specific...
1029.38 1031.06 SPEAKER_06  Crazy for them to be getting a shout out.
1031.06 1032.10 SPEAKER_06  Specific niche communists.
1032.10 1033.86 SPEAKER_06  They've still got shooters on Twitter.
1033.86 1034.98 SPEAKER_06  Like, here's the thing.
1034.98 1039.30 SPEAKER_06  This guy was doing Chairman Gonzalo thought and, like...
1039.30 1040.58 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
1040.58 1044.02 SPEAKER_03  All the members of Shining Path in the cinema are in 1996.
1044.02 1044.82 SPEAKER_03  Oh, shit!
1044.82 1051.70 SPEAKER_06  I saw this in a jungle in Peru in, like, 1996, with a bunch of hostages I'd taken.
1051.70 1052.42 SPEAKER_06  It was like, yeah!
1052.42 1054.50 SPEAKER_06  She flouted up trans women in the jungle.
1054.50 1060.10 SPEAKER_03  The President's daughter, she's been groomed online by Che Guevara Jones.
1060.10 1062.02 SPEAKER_02  The President's daughter, Utopia.
1062.02 1062.58 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1062.58 1063.14 SPEAKER_03  Subtle.
1063.14 1067.86 SPEAKER_03  She stole a black box which contains something of great importance, we don't quite know what yet.
1067.86 1071.70 SPEAKER_03  And she bailed out of Air Force 3 and landed in LA.
1071.70 1073.86 SPEAKER_03  So, Snake, you gotta go in and get her out.
1073.86 1077.70 SPEAKER_03  And this is Roe Lahren, the commander of the base, and the President himself telling Snake this.
1077.70 1078.02 SPEAKER_06  Mm.
1078.02 1078.66 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
1078.66 1084.82 SPEAKER_06  And just to make sure that they'll do it, they hit him with Fox Dye from Metal Gear Solid.
1084.82 1085.14 SPEAKER_06  Mm-hmm.
1085.14 1085.86 SPEAKER_06  That he's got...
1086.74 1089.46 SPEAKER_06  It's one-to-one, Hideo Kojima, you thief!
1089.46 1090.34 SPEAKER_06  It's perfect, yeah.
1090.34 1090.98 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1090.98 1091.38 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1091.38 1092.82 SPEAKER_04  Okay, but here's the truth.
1092.82 1093.46 SPEAKER_04  Here's the truth.
1093.46 1095.54 SPEAKER_04  And Kojima will cop to this.
1095.54 1095.86 SPEAKER_04  Mm-hmm.
1095.86 1102.82 SPEAKER_04  Before doing the Metal Gear games, he just wanted to do an Escape from New York game.
1102.82 1103.22 SPEAKER_04  How fucking yeah.
1103.22 1106.74 SPEAKER_04  He just wanted to make Escape from New York the game.
1106.74 1107.06 SPEAKER_04  Mm-hmm.
1107.06 1110.02 SPEAKER_04  And he couldn't, so he made Metal Gear.
1110.02 1112.90 SPEAKER_04  And just was like, fuck it, I'll do my own thing.
1112.90 1113.06 SPEAKER_04  Mm-hmm.
1113.06 1114.82 SPEAKER_04  And I don't care.
1114.82 1120.90 SPEAKER_04  He did it so well, and I wanted an Escape from New York game, so he made Metal Gear and it was fucking great.
1120.90 1124.98 SPEAKER_04  But yeah, like, he doesn't even, he's not even remotely subtle.
1124.98 1126.10 SPEAKER_04  No, not at all.
1126.10 1129.14 SPEAKER_04  About the fact that he lived in directly from John Carpenter films.
1129.14 1129.54 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1129.54 1132.98 SPEAKER_03  So they've injected him with this virus, which is gonna kill him in 10 hours.
1132.98 1133.38 SPEAKER_03  Yes.
1133.38 1136.42 SPEAKER_03  If he doesn't get the weapon or whatever it is, then bring it back.
1136.42 1139.22 SPEAKER_03  He tries to lunge for the president, which is great.
1139.22 1140.26 SPEAKER_03  Always do that if he gets a chance.
1140.26 1142.18 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, definitely.
1142.18 1143.94 SPEAKER_02  Again, you can really impress me, audience.
1144.66 1145.70 SPEAKER_03  But he's a hologram.
1145.70 1146.66 SPEAKER_03  They fucking tricked him.
1146.66 1147.54 SPEAKER_03  The holograms.
1147.54 1148.90 SPEAKER_03  Holograms are part of this movie.
1148.90 1149.78 SPEAKER_06  Hmm.
1149.78 1150.10 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
1151.06 1152.90 SPEAKER_06  And to be fair, they clown on him for this.
1152.90 1154.18 SPEAKER_06  They're like, oh, you fucking idiot.
1154.18 1155.78 SPEAKER_06  We've been holograms the whole time.
1155.78 1156.26 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, like dumbass.
1156.26 1156.90 SPEAKER_06  Morons.
1156.90 1157.70 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, yeah.
1157.70 1159.38 SPEAKER_06  They really make a big deal of it.
1159.38 1159.94 SPEAKER_06  Like...
1159.94 1163.22 SPEAKER_03  They say, get the box back for a full pardon, and the president goes, freedom!
1163.22 1166.82 SPEAKER_03  And Snake goes, In America, it died a long time ago.
1166.82 1167.46 SPEAKER_03  Yeah!
1167.46 1167.94 SPEAKER_01  Yeah!
1167.94 1168.50 SPEAKER_01  Yeah!
1168.50 1168.98 SPEAKER_01  Yeah!
1168.98 1171.46 SPEAKER_04  I think that's what it is.
1171.46 1181.30 SPEAKER_04  I think that might be what it is, is that so many other action heroes that we saw during it were pretty like, obey the president, I'm working for the president, you're working for the US government.
1181.30 1185.14 SPEAKER_04  Snake Plissken is explicitly Antifa.
1185.14 1191.94 SPEAKER_04  He's explicitly just like, do his own thing, fuck the government, fuck societal norms.
1191.94 1194.58 SPEAKER_04  He lunges at the president in the first ten minutes of the movie.
1194.58 1196.74 SPEAKER_04  He was about to take him out right there.
1196.74 1197.46 SPEAKER_03  His hands!
1197.46 1203.94 SPEAKER_06  So, we only covered half the mission though, because half of it is get the black box back.
1203.94 1213.06 SPEAKER_06  The other bit is kill the president's daughter, like on his behalf, because she's gone rogue, she's gone woke.
1213.06 1213.46 SPEAKER_06  She's woke.
1213.46 1222.18 SPEAKER_06  And we see some video of her hijacking Air Force 3, and being like, you gotta open the borders, you know, goddamn America.
1222.18 1224.42 SPEAKER_03  She explicitly says, you gotta open the borders.
1224.42 1225.62 SPEAKER_03  That's part of it.
1225.62 1226.18 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, definitely.
1226.18 1229.62 SPEAKER_03  Absolute, absolute fucking queen shit, by the way.
1229.62 1234.34 SPEAKER_04  I fully, in this film, stan Utopia.
1234.34 1234.82 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1234.82 1241.86 SPEAKER_04  It's amazing that her name was already Utopia, and that was not her post-queer awakening name that she chose for herself.
1241.86 1243.94 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, that is a good name, I see.
1243.94 1246.18 SPEAKER_04  How do I not know more dolls named Utopia?
1246.18 1248.10 SPEAKER_04  That name goes so hard.
1248.10 1248.66 SPEAKER_04  I know, right?
1248.66 1250.66 SPEAKER_04  I feel like we've met a couple of Utopias.
1250.66 1251.30 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1251.30 1260.42 SPEAKER_06  If we continue the trend from the previous episode of just saying people's actual names on the recording, and there are Utopias pointing at the screen right now, like, what the fuck?
1260.42 1265.46 SPEAKER_03  Well, given the rate at which this podcast cracks eggs, hey, if you're out there and you're looking for a name, how about Utopia?
1265.46 1268.90 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, if you just cracked, check out, try Utopia, you know?
1268.90 1274.18 SPEAKER_06  As a certified member of the weird name caucus of trans girls, like, you gotta go there.
1274.18 1274.90 SPEAKER_06  You can do that.
1274.90 1275.70 SPEAKER_01  Mm.
1275.70 1276.58 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, you can do that.
1276.58 1278.74 SPEAKER_02  To me, all trans girls are Utopia.
1278.74 1283.86 SPEAKER_04  Put that Luna dog tag away, doll.
1283.86 1284.74 SPEAKER_02  You gotta do that.
1284.74 1285.94 SPEAKER_04  You gotta press name.
1286.66 1287.46 SPEAKER_04  Ready to go.
1287.46 1290.98 SPEAKER_02  First of all, go past A in the baby name book, okay?
1290.98 1291.70 SPEAKER_02  I understand.
1291.70 1292.58 SPEAKER_02  It takes some time.
1292.58 1293.06 SPEAKER_02  It takes some time.
1293.06 1296.26 SPEAKER_02  Sometimes you might hang out in A for a bit, and then, you know.
1296.26 1297.86 SPEAKER_06  No, I've moved in.
1297.86 1298.90 SPEAKER_06  I've put roots down in A now.
1298.90 1299.46 SPEAKER_06  It's my brand.
1299.46 1299.78 SPEAKER_06  But anyway.
1299.78 1300.74 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, no, you can't.
1300.74 1302.10 SPEAKER_06  You're fucked if you want to change that.
1302.10 1310.10 SPEAKER_06  The consideration you have to make when you're naming yourself as a trans girl is, is it a name you would want shouted at the dog park in search of you?
1314.42 1315.30 SPEAKER_02  It's El Clasico.
1315.30 1315.94 SPEAKER_02  You've been poisoned.
1315.94 1316.98 SPEAKER_02  You've got 10 hours to live.
1316.98 1317.54 SPEAKER_02  Do the thing.
1317.54 1318.50 SPEAKER_02  We'll give you the antidote.
1318.50 1318.90 SPEAKER_02  Bam.
1318.90 1319.38 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, yeah.
1319.38 1320.74 SPEAKER_03  We're gonna give him some gadgets.
1320.74 1321.78 SPEAKER_03  We'll give him a bunch of guns.
1321.78 1322.42 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1322.42 1327.70 SPEAKER_03  We're gonna give you a hologram projector that can project you as a hologram for up to two minutes.
1327.70 1328.18 SPEAKER_03  Mm-hmm.
1328.18 1329.06 SPEAKER_03  Question mark.
1329.06 1330.74 SPEAKER_03  Not sure whether it's needed, but remember, write that down.
1330.74 1331.14 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, remember that.
1331.14 1331.70 SPEAKER_03  Remember that.
1331.70 1334.26 SPEAKER_03  And then also, we're gonna give you a sick outfit.
1334.26 1334.58 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
1334.58 1335.22 SPEAKER_06  We're gonna, yeah.
1335.22 1346.50 SPEAKER_06  Well, the federal government has invested like hundreds of millions of dollars to create the sexiest outfit ever seen, and they got their money's worth.
1346.50 1347.94 SPEAKER_06  And it fits in perfectly, so...
1347.94 1348.98 SPEAKER_06  Oh, yeah.
1348.98 1350.66 SPEAKER_06  They had his measurements on file.
1350.66 1351.62 SPEAKER_06  They were like, let's go.
1351.62 1352.02 SPEAKER_06  Go for it.
1352.02 1352.58 SPEAKER_06  So...
1352.58 1357.86 SPEAKER_06  He's got like a kind of knee-length black leather trench coat.
1357.86 1358.26 SPEAKER_06  Mm-hmm.
1358.26 1359.62 SPEAKER_06  A kind of like...
1359.62 1361.62 SPEAKER_06  Like a leather...
1361.62 1363.22 SPEAKER_03  Black sleeveless vest.
1363.22 1366.42 SPEAKER_02  Black sleeveless vest with two zips on the shoulders.
1366.42 1367.22 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1367.22 1368.66 SPEAKER_05  Leather trousers.
1368.66 1369.22 SPEAKER_06  Leather trousers and leather boots.
1369.22 1370.66 SPEAKER_06  And he doesn't even want to wear this.
1370.66 1375.54 SPEAKER_06  Like when he comes in, he is wearing the most fucked up leather jacket I've ever seen in my life.
1375.54 1378.66 SPEAKER_06  It looks like they buried it in a sewage pit for a month.
1378.66 1380.10 SPEAKER_06  Like, it's awful.
1380.10 1380.66 SPEAKER_06  Perfect.
1380.66 1386.74 SPEAKER_06  It's like genuinely repulsive, and it's like the olfactory ethics lately.
1386.74 1393.54 SPEAKER_04  See, that jacket, by the way, would cost $4,000 on Melrose and Hollywood if you were to buy it in that exact variation.
1393.54 1393.86 SPEAKER_04  Oh, yeah.
1393.86 1393.94 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1393.94 1394.42 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1394.42 1399.94 SPEAKER_06  I'm in gallery department buying the like incredibly fucked up leather jacket.
1399.94 1404.66 SPEAKER_03  But this is this stealth clothing that the radar reflects whatever.
1404.66 1405.14 SPEAKER_03  Mm-hmm.
1405.14 1407.14 SPEAKER_03  Also, this way they keep throwing shit at him.
1407.14 1412.26 SPEAKER_03  So they're like, by the way, you gotta hurry up because the United States is about to go to war with fucking everyone.
1412.66 1417.14 SPEAKER_03  Shining Path has united all third world countries against the US.
1417.14 1420.90 SPEAKER_03  Cubans and Brazilians are poised to land in Miami.
1420.90 1424.10 SPEAKER_03  The Ugandans and Colombians are making a run at the border.
1424.10 1425.78 SPEAKER_03  I'm like, why is Uganda involved?
1427.54 1431.14 SPEAKER_06  This is the true Maoist third worldism, you know?
1431.14 1435.94 SPEAKER_02  I love this fucking world building where they're just like, yeah, something's happening over there.
1435.94 1438.50 SPEAKER_02  Anyway, they're just like things are occurring.
1438.50 1439.14 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1439.14 1447.62 SPEAKER_06  All the oppressed peoples of the earth are out there planning in Maoist standard English exactly how to hang every family dog in America.
1447.62 1448.34 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
1448.34 1450.26 SPEAKER_06  And if you don't stop them.
1450.26 1450.74 SPEAKER_03  Because this is their big chance.
1450.74 1454.10 SPEAKER_03  Because if America's lost the black box, it's that important that Cuervo Jones has it.
1454.10 1456.26 SPEAKER_03  But now that he's got it, everyone's gonna take a go.
1456.26 1467.86 SPEAKER_04  After he gets all of this explained to him in great detail about how the world is about to go into full chaos, his response to that is once again taking out his gun and trying to murder everyone around him.
1467.86 1468.50 SPEAKER_04  I love this.
1468.50 1468.98 SPEAKER_02  Yes.
1468.98 1471.30 SPEAKER_02  And they're like, thought you'd fucking do that, you dickhead.
1471.30 1472.42 SPEAKER_02  First clips blanks.
1472.42 1472.98 SPEAKER_02  Eh.
1472.98 1475.06 SPEAKER_02  It's so funny.
1475.06 1476.58 SPEAKER_04  They keep pranking this man.
1476.58 1477.30 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1477.30 1478.58 SPEAKER_04  It's just so good.
1478.58 1479.70 SPEAKER_04  It rules.
1479.70 1488.10 SPEAKER_04  I love how much they absolutely knew, like, they just laugh, it's like, ha ha ha, we already knew you tried to immediately murder us.
1488.10 1490.66 SPEAKER_04  So it wasn't even another hologram situation.
1490.66 1497.38 SPEAKER_04  They went out of their way to create blanks for this first clip, knowing that Snake Plissken was going to try to empty it into them.
1497.38 1498.18 SPEAKER_03  Mm-hmm.
1498.18 1502.26 SPEAKER_03  And also knowing that Snake Plissken wouldn't check the rounds or tell the weight, whatever.
1502.26 1510.98 SPEAKER_06  There's a bit that I really, really like, where- so there's two, like, fascist cops who are, like, briefing him throughout the inventory scene.
1510.98 1511.30 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
1511.30 1525.30 SPEAKER_06  And the male one turns round for the first time in the scene, revealing that he has the world's tiniest, shittiest ponytail poking out the back of the, like, black, like, field cap.
1525.30 1526.02 SPEAKER_06  Perfect.
1526.02 1533.86 SPEAKER_06  And there's like, previous context for the- those are up there with the kink.com armory for me, seeing those, like, black utility covers.
1533.86 1534.74 SPEAKER_06  Mm-hmm.
1534.74 1541.14 SPEAKER_06  So, like, seeing that and the tiny little shittiest ponytail, I'm like, viscerally repulsed by this guy.
1541.14 1541.70 SPEAKER_06  Oh my god.
1541.70 1542.18 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1542.18 1556.18 SPEAKER_04  It's important, it's important to show the contrast between his shitty balding ponytail just barely clinging on to life, and Snake's luscious box.
1556.18 1557.22 SPEAKER_04  Oh, yeah.
1557.22 1557.78 SPEAKER_06  Glorious, man.
1557.78 1560.50 SPEAKER_06  So, Snake's hair is looking positively Devonian.
1560.50 1561.78 SPEAKER_06  It's- it's real good.
1561.78 1562.42 SPEAKER_06  Thank you so much.
1562.42 1581.62 SPEAKER_04  The fact that he- he's wearing, like, the shittiest leather jacket you've ever seen, but has hair built for a Trassemé commercial, built for, like, there's like- he- he may have been out of food, he may have been out of ammunition, but he had at least five hair products ready to go to keep that mullet alive during the dystopian apocalypse.
1581.62 1587.14 SPEAKER_02  It's not the best Kurt Russell mullet in a John Carpenter movie, that of course goes to Big Trouble in Little China.
1587.14 1590.82 SPEAKER_02  It's not even the best mullet in a John Carpenter movie that of course goes to They Live.
1591.46 1592.90 SPEAKER_02  But it's pretty fucking good.
1592.90 1600.98 SPEAKER_06  We- we should- we should genuinely sell the, like, Devon schema of Kurt Russell haircuts as, like, a poster.
1600.98 1602.74 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, that's a great idea.
1602.74 1603.86 SPEAKER_01  Mullet ranking.
1603.86 1604.50 SPEAKER_06  I love that.
1604.50 1611.14 SPEAKER_06  But so, but so, they get him into the fucking nuclear-powered mini-submarine that he's gonna ride to Los Angeles.
1611.14 1612.18 SPEAKER_04  So cool! Yeah!
1612.18 1615.86 SPEAKER_04  Which is, by the way, exactly how Metal Gear Solid 1 starts.
1615.86 1616.02 SPEAKER_04  Perfect!
1616.02 1616.58 SPEAKER_04  Yeah!
1616.58 1618.02 None  Fuck it!
1618.02 1622.42 SPEAKER_06  I- I- I- I- I- my sole note at this point is I love the fucking movies.
1622.42 1623.86 SPEAKER_06  I love their shit.
1623.86 1625.30 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, movies are so good.
1625.30 1628.90 SPEAKER_02  He's- he's lit from below in green, he looks fucking haggard.
1630.18 1634.98 SPEAKER_06  All the devices in this, by the way, look very, like, skeuomorphic.
1634.98 1641.62 SPEAKER_06  Like, everybody's got a little personal computer thing that runs off tiny CDs and has, like, a physical keypad and shit.
1641.62 1647.62 SPEAKER_06  And so all the controls on this submarine's gonna, like, flip switches and turn dials and pull levers and shit.
1647.62 1648.26 SPEAKER_06  It's fantastic.
1648.26 1648.98 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, it's fun.
1648.98 1649.54 SPEAKER_02  It's fun.
1649.54 1650.34 SPEAKER_02  It's just so good.
1650.34 1651.62 SPEAKER_02  So, like, mini-discs.
1651.62 1653.54 SPEAKER_04  Which of course leads to the best thing.
1653.54 1656.74 SPEAKER_04  They're explaining all the controls to Gliskin.
1656.74 1664.34 SPEAKER_04  After knowing that this man was going to try to kill them, did not respect authority, gives him this extremely complex submarine to operate.
1664.34 1668.66 SPEAKER_04  And then of course, he breaks it immediately.
1668.66 1668.98 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1668.98 1673.86 SPEAKER_03  He rubs the reactor up to full power and just, like, crashes it straight away.
1673.86 1674.42 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1674.42 1678.42 SPEAKER_06  It's perfect action movie guy to be like, Yeah.
1678.42 1680.98 SPEAKER_06  And just gun the thing.
1680.98 1684.10 SPEAKER_03  They say slow down, they say, you slow down, dickhead, I'm the one who's dying.
1684.10 1687.14 SPEAKER_03  And then just, like, increases it to 100%, crashes it on the shore of LA.
1687.14 1690.82 SPEAKER_06  The water 911s are building on the way in.
1690.82 1692.02 SPEAKER_04  Like, it's perfect.
1692.02 1692.82 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1692.82 1695.38 SPEAKER_04  He's straight up, they build this massive thing, explain everything.
1695.38 1698.50 SPEAKER_04  He's like, oh, fuck your rules and fuck your control system.
1698.50 1700.98 SPEAKER_04  And it just crashes in a medium frame.
1700.98 1705.30 SPEAKER_03  He drives past the underwater remains of Universal Studios, which is quite funny.
1705.30 1705.94 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, that's good.
1705.94 1706.98 SPEAKER_02  I...
1706.98 1707.70 SPEAKER_02  Oh, yeah.
1707.70 1708.42 SPEAKER_02  This is really good.
1708.42 1709.70 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1709.70 1710.42 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, he lands...
1710.42 1713.38 SPEAKER_04  Which, by the way, it goes to crazy CGI.
1713.38 1716.66 SPEAKER_04  Crazy early 90s CGI of the submarine.
1717.14 1717.86 SPEAKER_04  Perfect.
1717.86 1731.62 SPEAKER_04  Um, yeah, Abby just mentioned it, but as he goes by Universal, one of my favorite sight gags is that an actual giant great white shark jumps out of the Universal sign and tries to eat the submarine.
1731.62 1732.42 SPEAKER_04  Fun.
1732.42 1733.06 SPEAKER_04  Fun stuff.
1733.06 1733.46 SPEAKER_04  Really good.
1733.46 1736.82 SPEAKER_02  He lands, and who is the first guy that meets him?
1736.82 1738.58 SPEAKER_02  Peter fucking Fonda.
1738.58 1739.30 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1739.30 1742.58 SPEAKER_02  At his peak Peter Fonda.
1742.58 1745.62 SPEAKER_02  Playing a man called Pipeline who is a surfer.
1745.62 1748.34 SPEAKER_02  Playing area Californian man.
1748.34 1751.38 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, because what we quickly learned is all the gangs of Peter Fonda.
1751.38 1754.90 SPEAKER_03  All the gangs on the island of LA have like a theme.
1754.90 1757.06 SPEAKER_03  So this is the surfer gang.
1757.06 1757.46 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1757.46 1758.82 SPEAKER_03  Of course they do, baby.
1758.82 1759.78 SPEAKER_03  Yes.
1759.78 1761.54 SPEAKER_03  It's so good.
1761.54 1764.82 SPEAKER_04  This is the surfer gang and they're all like, dude, get off our beach.
1764.82 1766.58 SPEAKER_04  Expect nothing less of us.
1766.58 1768.98 SPEAKER_04  We show up with a fucking look regardless.
1768.98 1769.62 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1769.62 1770.58 SPEAKER_04  Every faction in this is dream.
1770.58 1771.54 SPEAKER_04  It's like the Warriors.
1771.54 1772.42 SPEAKER_02  It's great.
1772.42 1773.54 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, it's so fun.
1773.54 1773.86 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1773.86 1781.86 SPEAKER_02  I mean, from I think the mid 80s to the mid 90s, there was quite a lot of the American movie industry invested in creating Warriors movies.
1781.86 1784.82 SPEAKER_02  You know, like Mad Max 2 is not American, obviously.
1784.82 1786.82 SPEAKER_02  It was a better time in that way.
1786.82 1793.38 SPEAKER_02  Like, there's just a lot of movies where it's like, what if society collapsed and everyone got into like themed gangs?
1793.38 1794.18 SPEAKER_02  Mm.
1794.18 1794.98 SPEAKER_02  It's like, yeah.
1794.98 1796.10 SPEAKER_02  What if that happened?
1796.10 1797.46 SPEAKER_02  That's cool as shit.
1797.46 1798.02 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
1798.02 1804.34 SPEAKER_06  I think if society collapsed, I would be thinking about the theme of my gang pretty much instantly.
1804.34 1804.74 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
1804.74 1806.98 SPEAKER_06  I think that would be like top of the agenda.
1806.98 1807.54 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
1807.54 1809.70 SPEAKER_04  Oh, we've all thought about it already.
1809.70 1810.02 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1810.02 1816.74 SPEAKER_04  If you're not doing this already, given the state of the world already coming up with your gang theme and like symbols and everything.
1816.74 1819.94 SPEAKER_02  Every single cardinal knows what their fucking papal name would be.
1819.94 1823.62 SPEAKER_02  Every single trans person knows what the vibe of their apocalypse gang would be.
1823.62 1823.94 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1823.94 1825.38 SPEAKER_02  A fucking hundred percent.
1825.38 1826.58 SPEAKER_02  You just think about these things.
1826.58 1831.06 SPEAKER_06  Leaning heavily for podcasts, you know, we're gonna have like a microphone on the hood of the car.
1831.94 1834.98 SPEAKER_03  I think I'm gonna go equestrian, like riding gear.
1834.98 1835.86 SPEAKER_03  That's quite a cool look.
1835.86 1836.90 SPEAKER_03  No, I think it's pretty good.
1836.90 1838.50 SPEAKER_04  I'll get like a gilet and some boots.
1838.50 1840.98 SPEAKER_04  I can easily see you leaning into that, Abby.
1840.98 1841.46 SPEAKER_04  Really good.
1841.46 1842.02 SPEAKER_04  100%.
1842.02 1853.78 SPEAKER_04  I mean, here's the thing I also just want to say, like part of my fondness for this film comes from the fact that I am 100% a Los Angeles native.
1853.78 1855.14 SPEAKER_04  I was born and raised here.
1856.02 1857.38 SPEAKER_04  My dad worked in the city.
1857.38 1864.34 SPEAKER_04  So all of my childhood, teen years, all of that was spent riding a skateboard around Hollywood, LA.
1864.34 1870.90 SPEAKER_04  Every single time they show like, you know, him going through the submarine, these highway exits, these street signs.
1871.70 1876.74 SPEAKER_04  These are this is like my this is my neighborhood like home turf.
1876.74 1877.38 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1877.38 1881.94 SPEAKER_04  So it is really wild because usually like New York's the go to in so many of these films.
1881.94 1883.62 SPEAKER_04  Well, you know, it's always like New York.
1884.34 1884.90 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, they did.
1884.90 1886.26 SPEAKER_04  They did New York first, of course.
1886.26 1895.62 SPEAKER_04  But but in most movies like you see New York, LA being used in this way was such a delight the first time I saw it because I know exactly what these ruins are.
1895.62 1900.58 SPEAKER_04  In every single one of these locations I have been to in its current state.
1900.58 1901.14 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1901.14 1904.58 SPEAKER_04  And get to see John Carpenter's fun dystopian version of it.
1904.58 1905.86 SPEAKER_04  So that's delightful.
1905.86 1909.06 SPEAKER_06  And so he goes into the city.
1909.06 1909.46 SPEAKER_06  And there's a whole society.
1909.46 1913.86 SPEAKER_06  There's a tool song playing in the background that one shots me.
1913.86 1923.70 SPEAKER_06  And then as he goes into a building, Tori Amos' professional widow comes on for like two bars, which is the soundtrack alone is like a one-two punch.
1923.70 1929.14 SPEAKER_06  Every woman in this scene is maximally hot and clocky.
1929.14 1931.06 SPEAKER_02  It's like incredible.
1931.06 1935.38 SPEAKER_02  I agree with you, but let's expand those parameters a little bit.
1935.38 1939.46 SPEAKER_02  Every woman in this movie is unbelievably hot and clocky.
1940.90 1943.30 SPEAKER_02  There are crowd shots where I'm just like, holy shit.
1943.30 1944.26 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1944.26 1945.30 SPEAKER_04  It's fantastic.
1945.30 1946.02 SPEAKER_04  This is the truth.
1946.02 1949.22 SPEAKER_04  Look, this wasn't how people looked in the nineties.
1949.22 1950.82 SPEAKER_04  This was very predictive.
1950.82 1951.06 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1951.06 1952.26 SPEAKER_04  It's how people look now.
1952.26 1952.90 SPEAKER_04  It's crazy.
1952.90 1954.10 SPEAKER_04  It's how people look now.
1954.10 1957.22 SPEAKER_04  This is very like looking at the fashions and everything.
1957.22 1961.06 SPEAKER_04  This is every rave I've gone to for the last two years.
1961.06 1962.90 SPEAKER_04  Everyone is dressed like this.
1962.90 1969.22 SPEAKER_04  This is a Dolls Kill like fall collection is what I'm seeing here.
1969.22 1969.70 SPEAKER_04  They did.
1969.70 1971.14 SPEAKER_03  That is where the costumes came from.
1971.14 1980.26 SPEAKER_06  I genuinely, I had a very similar reaction because when he comes across some guys, some like tough guys, they're also Nazis by the way, but like they're wearing leather vests and goatees and shit.
1980.26 1986.26 SPEAKER_06  And like LA has been turned over, not just to the rave scene, but to the kink scene, right?
1986.26 1990.26 SPEAKER_06  Every woman is the most beautiful transsexual princess you've ever seen.
1990.26 1993.46 SPEAKER_06  Every man is Mr. Leather Vest Goatee Man.
1993.46 1996.02 SPEAKER_06  The whole city is one big munch.
1996.02 1996.66 SPEAKER_06  It's terrifying.
1996.66 1998.26 SPEAKER_06  It's un-fucking-believable.
1998.26 2007.86 SPEAKER_03  He finds a member of the previous rescue team inside the brothel who's been crucified and the neo-nazis are using him for knife throwing target practice.
2007.86 2008.26 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2008.26 2008.66 SPEAKER_03  It's like, great.
2008.66 2009.78 SPEAKER_03  This guy's not going to be much help.
2009.78 2016.66 SPEAKER_02  One of those neo-nazis is Robert Carradine from Revenge of the Nerds walking around with a spostika soul patch.
2016.66 2017.06 SPEAKER_02  Cool.
2017.06 2017.54 SPEAKER_02  Great man.
2017.54 2019.30 SPEAKER_02  What the fuck are you doing?
2019.30 2021.70 SPEAKER_02  You need us to shave that, surely.
2021.70 2022.10 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2022.10 2024.50 SPEAKER_02  Like, I think it's a tattoo, but I cannot tell.
2024.50 2031.70 SPEAKER_03  Also, if you're on the prison island and you're still a neo-nazi, it's like, man, you must have fucked up because those are your boys outside.
2031.70 2032.66 SPEAKER_03  They put you in there.
2032.66 2034.82 SPEAKER_02  Were you not sufficiently Christian or what?
2034.82 2035.22 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2035.22 2036.90 SPEAKER_02  How did you get put on the island?
2036.90 2038.74 SPEAKER_04  They're not going to take you back.
2038.74 2040.10 SPEAKER_04  I will tell you how.
2040.10 2053.14 SPEAKER_04  Just look at the current American right wing tearing itself apart by people who are anti-Trump, but so racist that they go against the capitalist ideas of replacing Americans with cheaper workers.
2054.02 2056.98 SPEAKER_04  This is, again, happening step by step.
2056.98 2057.70 SPEAKER_04  This is what we're saying.
2057.70 2062.42 SPEAKER_04  These are all the people who are now angry at Trump and Musk because they're not racist enough.
2062.42 2063.70 SPEAKER_04  And they got sent to LA.
2063.70 2068.10 SPEAKER_06  All of these guys got deported for operating a Groyper Twitter account.
2068.10 2073.14 SPEAKER_06  So, Snake does not find- God, I wish that was a deportable crime.
2073.14 2074.42 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
2074.42 2078.66 SPEAKER_06  Does not find anybody except the guy who's been killed.
2078.66 2087.46 SPEAKER_06  He kills one of the Nazis on the way out and just kind of wanders post-apocalyptic LA for a bit, which looks like how people think Burning Man looks.
2087.46 2088.18 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
2088.18 2090.26 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, it's just like an open-air market.
2090.26 2091.94 SPEAKER_03  Like, I don't know, it could be worse.
2091.94 2092.10 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, it's pretty nice.
2092.10 2093.22 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, it's having a nice time out there.
2093.22 2094.34 SPEAKER_06  It's a society.
2094.34 2099.46 SPEAKER_06  This kind of mixed-use walkable urbanism is actually illegal to build in many American cities.
2099.46 2102.50 SPEAKER_06  In fact, that's how they got sent to the prison islanders.
2102.50 2112.82 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, who happens to be driving past but Gwebo Jones himself, driving past in a sick open-top car, with Utopia in a bikini at his side and the black box in his hand.
2112.82 2133.78 SPEAKER_06  Not just a car, but specifically a lowrider, because it's like his- like, the racism of this, of being like, well, he's simultaneously like a gang leader and a communist who's affiliated with both on a kind of racial basis, leads me to be like, it's not great, is the thing.
2133.78 2137.54 SPEAKER_02  We will talk about the racializing of the other at some point.
2137.54 2138.90 SPEAKER_03  We'll get a shag with a black guy.
2138.90 2150.66 SPEAKER_02  Utopia is wearing a half-length leather jacket with a sequin portrait of Curvasa Jones on the back of it.
2150.66 2152.74 SPEAKER_02  Like, just fucking fantastic.
2152.74 2155.86 SPEAKER_06  Not the sign of a great relationship.
2155.86 2157.38 SPEAKER_06  It is a little bit like...
2158.10 2165.46 SPEAKER_06  Two thirds of Dracula's ex-girlfriend present for this, for me to be like, it's a little bit like Dracula's ex-girlfriend.
2165.46 2167.46 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2168.26 2170.02 SPEAKER_03  Woman who's only seen one movie.
2170.02 2172.26 SPEAKER_03  Do you think this guy might be kind of controlling?
2172.26 2177.22 SPEAKER_02  I gotta stop making Becca wear that diamante image of me on all of her clothing.
2179.62 2182.98 SPEAKER_03  I kind of want a jacket with like, Gwebo Jones on it though, that would be kind of sick.
2182.98 2184.26 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, that would be kind of cool.
2184.26 2191.62 SPEAKER_03  But Snake steals a motorbike and he gives chase, we get a cool like, running motorbiking fight sequence, which I like.
2191.62 2194.74 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, there's a legit like, vaquero on horseback.
2194.74 2195.46 SPEAKER_06  There it is.
2195.46 2196.74 SPEAKER_06  With a Mac-10 shooting at him.
2196.74 2198.58 SPEAKER_02  It's like, get a horse, dog?
2199.86 2201.70 SPEAKER_02  How are you keeping a horse alive?
2202.26 2205.30 SPEAKER_06  They deported that horse for like, moral crimes.
2205.30 2207.70 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, that horse is really immoral.
2208.66 2209.78 SPEAKER_02  It's an atheist horse.
2209.78 2211.70 SPEAKER_02  That's a clearly atheist woke horse.
2212.90 2214.66 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, we know this horse is atheist.
2214.66 2215.70 SPEAKER_02  We can tell.
2215.70 2217.22 SPEAKER_02  Get him on the fucking islands.
2217.22 2219.22 SPEAKER_03  Horse doesn't believe in horse, Jesus.
2219.22 2223.46 SPEAKER_06  The Hispanic cowboy riding his woke horse.
2223.46 2224.34 SPEAKER_06  This is-
2224.34 2229.46 SPEAKER_04  Even the woke mind virus has spread to the animals now.
2229.46 2236.34 SPEAKER_02  The woke mind virus has broken the blood brain barrier. The zoonotic woke mind virus.
2236.34 2237.46 SPEAKER_02  The woke mind virus.
2237.46 2239.46 SPEAKER_01  The woke mind virus.
2239.46 2243.30 SPEAKER_02  Oh yeah, and again, that's quite predictive, because as we know.
2243.30 2244.34 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, yeah.
2244.34 2245.46 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2245.46 2250.42 SPEAKER_03  Snake pops a sick wheelie for no reason, ramps the bike for no reason.
2250.42 2251.46 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2251.46 2253.06 SPEAKER_04  There's a reason.
2253.06 2254.26 SPEAKER_04  There is of course a reason.
2254.26 2257.54 SPEAKER_04  That is a power move on Cuervo.
2257.54 2258.18 SPEAKER_04  Mm.
2258.18 2260.66 SPEAKER_06  Cuervo is like, is that Snake Plissken?
2260.66 2262.82 SPEAKER_06  Because everyone has recognized him so far.
2262.82 2263.86 SPEAKER_06  That's one of the other bits.
2263.86 2266.10 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, everyone is like, holy shit, it's Snake Plissken.
2266.90 2270.90 SPEAKER_02  And they're all like, and they all are like, and he fell off recently.
2270.90 2271.62 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2271.62 2272.34 None  Yeah.
2272.34 2275.14 SPEAKER_02  They all make sure to include that he's in his fucking flop.
2275.14 2276.34 SPEAKER_04  He looks like shit.
2276.34 2283.94 SPEAKER_04  Truth be told though, it's been a few years since escape from New York, and Snake Plissken is a celebrity in this world.
2283.94 2298.02 SPEAKER_04  And you have to imagine, a celebrity to probably everyone who is like a rebel, or a gang member, or been deported to LA, there's no way that looking as iconic as he does, that people won't recognize Snake Plissken.
2298.02 2298.50 SPEAKER_04  Of course.
2298.50 2306.50 SPEAKER_04  This guy, especially within this world of rebels, like Cuervo Jones would absolutely, immediately know, oh shit, Snake Plissken's trying to kill me.
2306.50 2307.22 SPEAKER_04  Oh, damn.
2307.22 2309.30 SPEAKER_03  Hell yeah, I'm arrived.
2309.30 2313.14 SPEAKER_06  So he reaches for his racially coded weapon.
2313.14 2313.94 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
2313.94 2317.38 SPEAKER_06  Of a set of like, bolas.
2317.38 2319.38 SPEAKER_06  He's got fucking bolas.
2320.18 2324.10 SPEAKER_06  He does one shot Snake with, like he gets him in the neck with these.
2324.10 2324.66 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2324.66 2327.22 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, he nails Snake with the fucking bolas, yeah.
2327.22 2327.54 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2327.54 2329.54 SPEAKER_02  And then I guess just keeps driving.
2330.10 2330.98 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, he just keeps going.
2330.98 2332.98 SPEAKER_02  He's like, someone kill this motherfucker, next.
2332.98 2333.54 SPEAKER_02  Mm-hmm.
2333.54 2341.86 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, and so his guys pull up, and Snake entices them into like a western style duel.
2341.86 2342.74 SPEAKER_06  Mm-hmm.
2342.74 2345.06 SPEAKER_06  Like a quick draw thing, which he just cheats.
2345.06 2351.38 SPEAKER_06  These guys do a perfect like, uh, western Mexican bandit chuckle.
2351.38 2351.78 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
2351.78 2353.94 SPEAKER_06  Like, you know the one I mean.
2353.94 2354.26 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
2354.26 2354.66 SPEAKER_03  It's like...
2354.66 2355.06 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
2355.06 2358.66 SPEAKER_06  It's so movie brained, you know?
2358.66 2362.66 SPEAKER_03  He calls this game Bangkok rules as well, and I'm like, it's called New Vegas now.
2362.66 2363.86 SPEAKER_03  Wait, you...
2363.86 2364.42 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, man.
2364.42 2365.62 SPEAKER_02  I mean...
2365.62 2369.46 SPEAKER_02  He should have said New Vegas rules, and I would have had the best drop fucking ever.
2369.46 2371.14 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, it does.
2371.14 2371.46 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, damn.
2371.46 2373.22 SPEAKER_03  Oh, hell yeah, it does.
2373.86 2377.94 SPEAKER_03  But he throws a can in the air, and he's like, nobody draws until the can hits the ground.
2377.94 2379.62 SPEAKER_03  He throws it in the air, and then he just shoots them all.
2379.62 2379.78 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2379.78 2380.42 SPEAKER_03  Cool.
2380.42 2380.74 SPEAKER_06  Just cheats.
2380.74 2381.62 SPEAKER_06  Classic stuff.
2381.62 2381.86 SPEAKER_06  Cool.
2381.86 2382.34 SPEAKER_06  Kind of funny.
2382.34 2382.74 SPEAKER_06  Love it.
2382.74 2390.42 SPEAKER_06  But so, then they call him on his Kodak, and they're like, our master plan to make you sicker and sicker throughout this mission.
2392.50 2395.46 SPEAKER_04  Which is just a terrible strategy on their part.
2395.46 2400.02 SPEAKER_04  It's just like, do you want this done, or do you just want to fucking kill Snake Plissken?
2400.02 2400.42 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2400.42 2401.94 SPEAKER_04  What is the goal here?
2401.94 2407.38 SPEAKER_03  It's like, I'm trying to infiltrate LA, but the sound of my ass cheeks in these leather trousers is clapping together in a little...
2407.38 2410.74 SPEAKER_03  Colonel.
2410.74 2413.78 SPEAKER_06  But so, he just kind of...
2413.78 2420.58 SPEAKER_06  His response to this is to just grab a lawn chair, sit down, and wait for next plot beat to turn up.
2420.58 2420.98 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
2420.98 2422.42 SPEAKER_03  He just waits for the next scene.
2422.42 2427.94 SPEAKER_06  Which it does, in the form of Spy Kids 2's Steve Buscemi.
2427.94 2428.02 SPEAKER_03  Hell yeah.
2428.02 2430.02 SPEAKER_06  Steve Buscemi's in this fucking movie.
2430.02 2430.58 SPEAKER_02  He is.
2430.58 2431.14 SPEAKER_03  Yippee!
2431.14 2434.42 SPEAKER_03  He's a Hollywood tour guide called Map to the Stars Eddie.
2434.42 2434.90 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2434.90 2435.38 SPEAKER_03  Which is just like...
2435.38 2435.86 SPEAKER_03  Really nice.
2435.86 2436.74 SPEAKER_03  I love it.
2436.74 2440.58 SPEAKER_03  He's got this little audio guide to like, this is where the stars of LA used to live.
2440.58 2441.54 SPEAKER_03  Like, come on my audio.
2441.54 2443.22 SPEAKER_03  And it's like, Snake's like, I don't need this.
2443.22 2443.78 SPEAKER_03  This is bullshit.
2443.78 2444.18 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
2444.18 2450.18 SPEAKER_06  The audio guide is also on one of these little fucking ubiquitous devices that has the keypads.
2450.18 2450.74 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
2451.54 2451.86 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2451.86 2453.46 SPEAKER_04  And Snake blows him off.
2453.46 2454.02 SPEAKER_04  He's like, fuck you.
2454.02 2461.86 SPEAKER_04  For all the type of characters that these actors play, they were cast to play the most version of them.
2461.86 2464.74 SPEAKER_04  Peter Fonda cast as the most Peter Fonda-y.
2464.74 2466.02 SPEAKER_04  Steve Buscemi as...
2466.02 2467.46 SPEAKER_04  It's like, okay, so what's the character?
2467.46 2469.94 SPEAKER_04  It's like, it's you, but like, 11.
2469.94 2470.74 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, turn it up, brother.
2470.74 2485.78 SPEAKER_04  Just turn the dial up on a Steve Buscemi type character as like, the most sort of like, like, just anxiety-filled, sort of weaselly character you could possibly run into in this dystopia.
2485.78 2488.34 SPEAKER_04  And again, I need to think he's- he nails it.
2488.34 2494.34 SPEAKER_04  Because I- you can't walk down Hollywood Boulevard without passing at least seven of these guys.
2494.34 2494.74 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2494.74 2497.78 SPEAKER_04  Trying to sell you maps to the stars.
2497.78 2498.42 SPEAKER_04  Mm.
2498.42 2501.22 SPEAKER_04  And they'd still be running this con in this environment.
2501.22 2501.62 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2501.62 2502.90 SPEAKER_04  This is completely realistic.
2502.90 2506.34 SPEAKER_02  He's like, look, if you're going towards Beverly Hills, you're gonna need my guide.
2506.34 2509.22 SPEAKER_02  And Snake goes, brother, fuck off.
2509.22 2510.50 SPEAKER_02  I don't care.
2510.50 2512.34 SPEAKER_02  And just continues walking.
2512.34 2517.46 SPEAKER_02  And he goes into, like, past a sign that says Beverly Hills, and it's the quiet surgery zone.
2517.46 2518.66 SPEAKER_02  And we-
2518.66 2521.22 SPEAKER_03  It's time to meet our next faction. Oh, baby.
2521.22 2525.62 SPEAKER_06  We meet our next- our next warriors-themed gang, and I love these guys.
2525.62 2529.54 SPEAKER_06  So there's like Jawas running around in Beverly Hills or fucking whatever.
2529.54 2530.42 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2530.42 2532.02 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, there are.
2532.02 2532.42 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2532.42 2533.06 SPEAKER_03  They look like Jawas.
2533.06 2534.18 SPEAKER_03  They've all got like big hoods on.
2534.18 2536.10 SPEAKER_03  There's like hooded people chasing ambulances.
2536.10 2538.10 SPEAKER_02  It's like, what's going on here?
2538.10 2542.42 SPEAKER_02  And he's in a bush, and there's another broadener who's called Taslima.
2542.42 2543.70 SPEAKER_03  Taslima.
2543.70 2546.26 SPEAKER_03  She's played by actress I'd love to see Valeria Gulino.
2546.26 2547.38 SPEAKER_02  Mm-hmm.
2547.38 2549.14 SPEAKER_02  She's really getting fucking clocky as hell.
2549.14 2550.74 SPEAKER_02  She's got a cool mullet.
2550.74 2552.50 SPEAKER_02  Don't get attached.
2552.50 2553.70 SPEAKER_02  Don't get too attached.
2554.42 2556.50 SPEAKER_02  Um, yeah, no, she's getting fucking fridged.
2556.50 2560.90 SPEAKER_03  And she's like, find your own bush to hide in, and then they're immediately captured by the Jawas.
2560.90 2562.10 SPEAKER_06  Mm-hmm.
2562.10 2568.02 SPEAKER_06  Who turn out to be a kind of plastic surgery themed gang.
2568.02 2568.74 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
2568.74 2571.38 SPEAKER_06  Because what do people in Beverly Hills get?
2571.38 2572.26 SPEAKER_06  Plastic surgery.
2572.26 2573.30 SPEAKER_04  Plastic fucking surgeries.
2573.30 2574.18 SPEAKER_04  Mm-hmm.
2574.18 2582.58 SPEAKER_04  Which, this had to be some inspiration for Reaper the Genetic Opera years later, because it definitely has those sort of vibes to it.
2582.58 2584.58 SPEAKER_06  There's a bit of Brazil in there too.
2584.58 2590.42 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, the reveal when the woman in the sexy nurse outfit turns around, and she's got like monster plastic surgery face.
2590.42 2593.54 SPEAKER_03  Like she's had way too much plastic surgery is really, really funny.
2593.54 2599.14 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, I really like all of the prosthetics here, because they don't go too far.
2599.14 2604.34 SPEAKER_02  They do all just kind of look like someone who's had a little bit too much plastic surgery.
2604.34 2605.94 SPEAKER_02  Who were those two brothers?
2605.94 2606.82 SPEAKER_06  The two like...
2606.82 2607.54 SPEAKER_06  Two brothers.
2607.54 2608.42 SPEAKER_02  You know the ones I mean.
2608.42 2609.22 SPEAKER_06  Two brothers.
2609.22 2610.10 SPEAKER_06  Two brothers.
2610.10 2612.42 SPEAKER_06  The two brothers had a shitload too much plastic surgery.
2612.42 2616.26 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, but the fucking blowjob brothers were the too much plastic surgery who died of Covid.
2616.26 2616.82 SPEAKER_06  Those guys.
2616.82 2618.10 SPEAKER_06  Everybody looks like those.
2618.10 2620.18 SPEAKER_03  They're all like Ollie London moded.
2620.18 2620.82 SPEAKER_03  Mm-hmm.
2620.82 2622.50 SPEAKER_03  They've all had way too much plastic surgery.
2622.50 2629.54 SPEAKER_03  Uh, and Taslima explains, oh, they had too many facelifts and surgeries over the years, and it caused their bodies to fall apart.
2629.54 2631.54 SPEAKER_03  So now they harvest people's organs.
2631.54 2634.10 SPEAKER_03  They have to have fresh transplants all the time.
2634.10 2635.14 SPEAKER_03  Otherwise, they just die.
2635.14 2635.62 SPEAKER_03  Cool.
2635.62 2636.02 SPEAKER_02  And then...
2636.02 2636.74 SPEAKER_02  Great faction.
2636.74 2638.74 SPEAKER_02  And then who fucking walks in, baby?
2638.74 2643.54 SPEAKER_02  Then who fucking walks in and causes me to stand up on my sofa and go, let's go.
2643.54 2644.74 SPEAKER_02  And salute.
2644.74 2646.02 SPEAKER_03  It's Bruce Campbell.
2646.02 2647.38 SPEAKER_03  Bruce fucking Campbell.
2647.38 2649.38 SPEAKER_03  Yes, the Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
2649.38 2652.66 SPEAKER_03  But he's Bruce Campbell, but he's had the surgery to give him the Chad skull.
2652.66 2653.22 SPEAKER_03  He's like, yeah.
2653.22 2654.74 SPEAKER_02  He classified Bruce Campbell.
2654.74 2655.70 SPEAKER_03  It's so funny.
2655.70 2660.42 SPEAKER_03  So he's got like the Chadly chin and like, yeah, it's way too much.
2660.42 2662.58 SPEAKER_04  He devours this scene.
2662.58 2663.46 SPEAKER_04  He so good.
2663.46 2671.14 SPEAKER_04  He chews up this scene with the most beautiful, just swaggering physicality.
2671.14 2671.54 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2671.54 2672.74 SPEAKER_04  Right from the get-go.
2672.74 2672.82 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2672.82 2673.86 SPEAKER_04  Right from the get-go.
2673.86 2677.30 SPEAKER_03  He looks like a real-life version of that Chad meme.
2677.38 2678.90 SPEAKER_03  It's so good.
2678.90 2681.30 SPEAKER_03  He's just missing the t-shirt that says, ouch, you know?
2681.30 2684.66 SPEAKER_03  He's like yassified.
2684.66 2686.50 SPEAKER_02  His cheeks are a little too pert.
2686.50 2688.98 SPEAKER_02  He's got those like thin ass eyebrows.
2688.98 2689.54 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2689.54 2691.14 SPEAKER_02  Just absolutely fantastic.
2691.70 2694.10 SPEAKER_06  So he's going to harvest Kurt Russell's eye.
2694.10 2694.66 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
2694.66 2695.06 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
2695.06 2695.22 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2695.22 2695.54 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
2695.54 2700.18 SPEAKER_06  And, but we remember the mouth dart from the inventory scene.
2700.18 2701.46 SPEAKER_06  If I remember to include it.
2701.46 2702.10 SPEAKER_03  We didn't tell you about that, but don't worry about it.
2702.10 2702.26 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2702.26 2703.30 SPEAKER_03  He's got a mouth dart.
2703.30 2704.34 SPEAKER_03  He's got a dart in the mouth.
2704.34 2707.06 SPEAKER_02  He stole a dart off of something in this scene.
2707.06 2707.78 SPEAKER_02  Well, he's got a mouth dart.
2707.78 2708.58 SPEAKER_02  They give him a mouth dart.
2708.58 2709.30 SPEAKER_02  Roe Laron gave it to him.
2709.30 2710.34 SPEAKER_02  He's got a mouth dart regardless.
2710.34 2713.38 SPEAKER_02  And he fucking pops Bruce Campbell.
2713.38 2713.86 SPEAKER_02  Bruce Campbell.
2713.86 2714.82 SPEAKER_02  Direct in the forehead.
2714.82 2715.30 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2715.30 2716.18 SPEAKER_02  Takes him hostage.
2716.18 2716.42 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2716.42 2716.98 SPEAKER_02  Takes him hostage.
2716.98 2717.38 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2717.38 2717.94 SPEAKER_02  Takes him hostage.
2717.94 2719.54 SPEAKER_02  Gets, tries to get himself out of Aaron.
2719.54 2721.30 SPEAKER_02  He's going to leave Taz Limer as well.
2721.30 2724.90 SPEAKER_02  And she's like, can you please fucking bring me with you, Doc?
2724.90 2725.30 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2725.30 2725.94 SPEAKER_01  To the next location.
2725.94 2726.74 SPEAKER_02  All right.
2726.74 2727.54 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, fine.
2727.54 2729.94 SPEAKER_02  I'll take you in one more scene of this movie.
2729.94 2731.14 SPEAKER_03  Which is the sewer level.
2731.14 2733.94 SPEAKER_03  They go to the sewer level and she's like, oh, I can point you in the direction of Quava Jones.
2733.94 2735.30 SPEAKER_03  He used to run guns for him.
2735.30 2736.10 SPEAKER_03  She hits on him.
2736.10 2737.54 SPEAKER_03  She follows him for a bit.
2737.54 2739.46 SPEAKER_03  And then she's just like, oh, Ellie's not so bad.
2739.46 2744.26 SPEAKER_06  She says she used to run guns with the black jihad.
2744.26 2744.66 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2744.66 2745.22 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2745.22 2749.06 SPEAKER_04  Again, gang after gang, after gang, after gang in this.
2749.06 2753.62 SPEAKER_04  Like each one that they established such a rogues gallery in L.A.
2753.62 2761.78 SPEAKER_04  at this point of characters that almost each one of these gangs or characters could be its own film that he goes against its own big bad.
2761.78 2763.14 SPEAKER_04  I Bruce Campbell.
2763.14 2764.42 SPEAKER_04  Perfect for his scenery.
2764.42 2766.26 SPEAKER_04  You almost want a little bit more.
2766.26 2766.74 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2766.74 2772.26 SPEAKER_04  But every single time Bruce Campbell makes a cameo in something, you feel nourished.
2772.26 2772.58 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2772.58 2774.90 SPEAKER_04  It doesn't matter if it's him and this.
2774.90 2777.62 SPEAKER_04  It doesn't matter if he's the ticket taker and Spider-Man.
2777.62 2781.86 SPEAKER_04  And every single time Bruce Campbell shows up for a cameo, you feel nourished.
2781.86 2782.90 SPEAKER_04  Absolutely.
2782.90 2783.30 SPEAKER_04  After all.
2783.30 2784.90 SPEAKER_04  You're fulfilled.
2784.90 2788.10 SPEAKER_02  Nice to see a director not afraid to use the word jihad.
2788.66 2789.30 SPEAKER_02  Take note.
2789.30 2789.70 SPEAKER_02  Sure.
2789.70 2790.50 SPEAKER_02  Dennis Villeneuve.
2790.50 2791.38 SPEAKER_06  Dennis Villeneuve.
2791.38 2792.74 SPEAKER_06  You pussy.
2792.74 2794.34 SPEAKER_06  But so, she hits on him.
2794.34 2797.78 SPEAKER_06  She hits on him in a really direct way that I kind of like.
2797.78 2798.18 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
2798.18 2800.90 SPEAKER_06  She more or less goes like, my boyfriend just broke up with me.
2800.90 2805.46 SPEAKER_06  I'm feeling very vulnerable right now if any snakes plissken want to take advantage of me.
2805.46 2807.46 SPEAKER_06  And he's like, no.
2807.46 2808.58 SPEAKER_06  Grey asexual.
2808.58 2811.06 SPEAKER_03  I'm going to be dead in seven hours.
2811.06 2811.78 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2811.78 2813.86 SPEAKER_02  She's like, yeah, I can read your future.
2813.86 2817.14 SPEAKER_02  And he hits her with, the future is right now.
2817.14 2818.66 SPEAKER_02  Fucking stupid.
2818.66 2822.90 SPEAKER_02  I guess makes sense if you're a guy who's dying, but like, ultimately the line is very stupid.
2822.90 2823.78 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2823.78 2826.34 SPEAKER_05  I don't have time for sex.
2826.34 2826.90 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
2826.90 2827.46 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
2827.46 2829.46 SPEAKER_06  I don't have three minutes to spare.
2829.46 2836.90 SPEAKER_06  But we find out that explicitly, she got deported for being Muslim, which I like that we say that.
2836.90 2837.30 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2837.30 2838.18 SPEAKER_02  She says as much.
2838.18 2840.18 SPEAKER_02  She's like, why are you here?
2840.18 2843.70 SPEAKER_02  And she's like, I was a Muslim in South Dakota and then they made that illegal.
2844.26 2848.66 SPEAKER_02  Which is like, which again is a very pressing cultural moment for us right now.
2848.66 2849.54 SPEAKER_02  Mm-hmm.
2849.54 2854.42 SPEAKER_03  And then she's like, actually, you know, it took me a while to adjust, but I think actually we've got the better end of the deal.
2854.42 2857.14 SPEAKER_03  Like we're the only, this is the only free zone left in the world.
2857.14 2857.54 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2857.54 2858.98 SPEAKER_03  Like here, you can be whoever you want.
2858.98 2863.94 SPEAKER_03  It's like, yeah, it's a little rough sometimes, but you know, actually, I think LA is not so bad once you get used to it.
2863.94 2864.82 SPEAKER_03  Immediately killed.
2866.66 2867.38 SPEAKER_06  Just straight away.
2867.38 2873.30 SPEAKER_06  Would you be too scared and nihilistic to have the courage of the kind of anarchist convictions that that would lead you to?
2873.30 2873.54 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
2873.54 2874.10 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
2874.10 2874.74 SPEAKER_06  Fridged.
2874.74 2875.06 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
2875.06 2876.10 SPEAKER_06  Instantly.
2876.10 2878.18 SPEAKER_06  This is a kind of like temporary autonomous zone.
2878.18 2879.22 SPEAKER_06  That's kind of cool.
2879.22 2880.10 SPEAKER_06  Shot dead.
2880.10 2881.22 SPEAKER_06  Mm.
2881.22 2891.78 SPEAKER_04  I mean, the fridging is, the fridging is terrible, but it also at the same time makes it so like even early on in this film, you're not too attached to any character.
2891.78 2897.06 SPEAKER_04  It does have that air to it where you think you're about to be introduced to a character who's going to survive the whole thing.
2897.06 2898.50 SPEAKER_04  And you know where this is going to go.
2898.50 2901.46 SPEAKER_04  She's going to be the romantic interest that survives to the end.
2901.46 2905.62 SPEAKER_04  She barely gets enough time to become a fridging cliche.
2905.62 2906.02 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2906.02 2908.98 SPEAKER_04  Like they don't even have enough time to really establish a relationship.
2908.98 2911.54 SPEAKER_02  They Rambo to this broad.
2911.54 2912.02 SPEAKER_02  Mm.
2912.02 2914.74 SPEAKER_02  You get one scene where you're like, I'm kind of nice.
2914.74 2916.34 SPEAKER_02  Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow.
2916.34 2920.98 SPEAKER_06  This is going to be a high scoring film that I actually enjoyed is the thing.
2920.98 2923.38 SPEAKER_03  Oh, it's a bonus, so we don't scum it, thankfully.
2923.38 2924.02 SPEAKER_06  Oh, that's true.
2924.02 2924.98 SPEAKER_06  Oh, yeah, we don't even score.
2924.98 2930.50 SPEAKER_06  I'm also kind of wondering, at least myself, what DSA LA is up to in this timeline.
2930.50 2936.18 SPEAKER_06  Like, we kind of see a little, yeah, we see a little, well, no, they'd be a themed gang, right?
2936.18 2936.90 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, well, no.
2936.90 2941.46 SPEAKER_06  Getting jumped by the democratic socialists of America, Los Angeles.
2941.46 2944.90 SPEAKER_03  Well, if no one is anything to go by, then they're all in the gym getting huge.
2944.90 2946.58 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, terrifying.
2946.58 2947.70 SPEAKER_02  You should be fucking too.
2947.70 2948.34 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2948.34 2949.94 SPEAKER_02  He keeps getting fucking calling himself a twink.
2949.94 2950.90 SPEAKER_02  No, you aren't, brother.
2950.90 2951.46 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2951.46 2959.70 SPEAKER_06  I mean, listen, if like, if the Maoists have unified the entire third world, what have the fucking, like, social democrats done?
2959.70 2960.18 SPEAKER_06  Something.
2960.18 2960.82 SPEAKER_06  Anyway.
2960.82 2963.22 SPEAKER_03  They're putting their feet up waiting for the third world to arrive, probably.
2963.22 2964.42 SPEAKER_03  They're mission accomplished.
2964.42 2965.14 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, it does.
2965.14 2966.58 SPEAKER_03  They're probably partying with Guervo Jones.
2966.58 2967.14 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, it does.
2967.14 2970.02 SPEAKER_06  Steve Buscemi rolls up in a car.
2970.02 2971.22 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, sick car.
2971.22 2976.98 SPEAKER_06  And Pliskin gets in and is immediately pranked for a, like, fifth time in this movie.
2976.98 2978.42 SPEAKER_06  He's not doing well.
2978.42 2980.26 SPEAKER_06  He gets owned constantly.
2980.26 2988.02 SPEAKER_06  Because Steve Buscemi hits the little, like, instead of an ejector seat button, what he's got is a free nipple piercings button.
2988.02 2990.34 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, they're like, shoot this man in both nipples.
2990.34 2996.50 SPEAKER_02  Like, it's just like a little fucking, like, thing rolls down and just blow darts him in both tits.
2996.50 2998.50 SPEAKER_02  And he goes like, it starts falling apart.
2998.50 3000.82 SPEAKER_03  It's the dart that knocks you out instantly.
3000.82 3001.38 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3001.38 3005.86 SPEAKER_04  I just, I appreciate just how many drugs are now coursing through Snake Pliskin's system.
3005.86 3014.98 SPEAKER_04  Not only does he have, he not only has Plutoxin going through his system, but he's been darted again and has even more drugs in him.
3014.98 3017.30 SPEAKER_04  So, he's really thriving.
3017.30 3019.30 SPEAKER_04  He's really thriving on this mission.
3019.30 3023.46 SPEAKER_06  Getting darted like an escaped zoo animal is really funny.
3023.46 3025.46 SPEAKER_06  I would hate to get darted.
3025.46 3026.26 SPEAKER_06  No, you wouldn't.
3026.26 3029.22 SPEAKER_03  That's like your ideal date, being hunted with a dart gun.
3029.22 3030.10 SPEAKER_02  I think I would.
3030.10 3031.14 SPEAKER_02  I would hate to get darted.
3031.14 3032.34 SPEAKER_02  You raise a great point.
3032.34 3033.14 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, okay.
3033.14 3035.38 SPEAKER_02  I would like to get tranquilized though, that would be funny.
3035.38 3039.46 SPEAKER_03  They clown on him again because he wakes up handcuffed to a treadmill.
3039.46 3040.66 SPEAKER_03  This is funny again.
3040.66 3042.10 SPEAKER_06  Again, had some dates.
3042.10 3050.74 SPEAKER_06  Um, yeah, it is really funny to like, like switch the treadmill on and he's just on the treadmill in the back of your big video.
3051.30 3056.34 SPEAKER_06  Because Cuervo Jones does this and then records his like, you know, letter to America.
3056.34 3059.14 SPEAKER_03  It goes out live to all the nations of the world.
3059.14 3059.78 SPEAKER_03  Mm-hmm.
3059.78 3072.02 SPEAKER_03  And we learned that the black box contains a weapon in it called Sword of Damocles, which is an, it's a series of satellites in space that can project an EMP anywhere on earth or everywhere at once if you activate the world code.
3072.02 3072.42 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3072.42 3077.06 SPEAKER_03  Uh, and like with the remote that's in the black box, he can control it and be as precise as he wants.
3077.06 3082.02 SPEAKER_03  So he turns off the president's hometown of Lynchburg, Virginia, as a kind of I'm serious threat.
3082.02 3082.50 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3082.50 3083.62 SPEAKER_03  Which is very funny.
3083.62 3085.22 SPEAKER_03  Also, just Sword of Damocles.
3085.22 3085.70 SPEAKER_04  Sword of Damocles.
3085.70 3086.42 SPEAKER_02  Sword of Damocles.
3086.42 3087.54 SPEAKER_04  What a fucking name.
3087.54 3088.34 SPEAKER_04  I love you, John.
3088.34 3089.14 SPEAKER_02  Cool as hell.
3089.14 3092.50 SPEAKER_02  This is explained to us by Leland Orser, who is also in this movie.
3092.50 3095.22 SPEAKER_02  A fucking, just another guy I love to see.
3095.22 3095.54 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3095.54 3096.42 SPEAKER_06  Hey, Leland Orser.
3096.42 3101.38 SPEAKER_06  But, but so this is a, this is a prime example of like leftist misogyny striking again, right?
3101.38 3112.50 SPEAKER_06  Because he, like the president's on the phone with his wife and then, uh, Cuervo Jones cuts off all the power to Lynchburg and he's like, yeah, women are kind of bitches, right?
3112.50 3115.22 SPEAKER_06  Like your daughter, who is also a bitch and I hate.
3115.22 3115.46 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
3115.46 3116.34 SPEAKER_06  And it's like, yeah.
3116.34 3117.14 SPEAKER_06  It's like, ah.
3117.14 3121.62 SPEAKER_06  She's wearing a leather jacket with a Diamante portrait of you on the back, dude.
3121.62 3124.66 SPEAKER_06  I'm not sure what more loyalty you're expecting.
3124.66 3125.54 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
3125.54 3127.14 SPEAKER_03  These Guervo bros.
3127.14 3127.86 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3127.86 3131.78 SPEAKER_02  So meanwhile, snake's in the background just on the treadmill.
3131.78 3134.42 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, snake's just like jogging in the background.
3134.42 3145.14 SPEAKER_02  You get a really American psychosis line here where the president is like, hang on, where they're like arguing about it and the president is like, ah, fuck, he's cooked, he's a POW.
3145.14 3146.02 SPEAKER_02  He's tanked.
3146.02 3148.90 SPEAKER_02  And like, our guy is like, but he's still alive.
3149.54 3155.70 SPEAKER_02  Which in the mid nineties, I know your ass is talking about Vietnam, brother, but you're not sorry.
3155.70 3156.74 SPEAKER_06  I wrote this down too.
3156.74 3159.78 SPEAKER_06  I wrote that because the line is, he's tanked, he's a POW.
3159.78 3163.06 SPEAKER_06  And I just wrote down, he's washed, he's cringe, he fell off.
3163.06 3165.06 SPEAKER_06  He's in his flop era.
3165.06 3166.74 SPEAKER_06  He is in his flop era.
3166.74 3168.90 SPEAKER_06  He's cooked.
3168.90 3176.90 SPEAKER_06  So they take him to, yeah, so they take him to, I don't remember the name of the stadium, but they take him to a stadium.
3176.90 3177.86 SPEAKER_06  Is it the Hollywood Bowl?
3177.86 3178.26 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3178.26 3178.82 SPEAKER_06  Is it?
3178.82 3179.70 SPEAKER_04  Resident Angelina?
3179.70 3180.42 SPEAKER_06  Fenway Park.
3180.42 3180.90 SPEAKER_06  I don't know.
3180.90 3184.66 SPEAKER_04  I don't think, I think it's the Rose Bowl, which is in Pasadena.
3184.66 3186.74 SPEAKER_04  I want to say that that's what it is.
3186.74 3192.10 SPEAKER_06  They take him to the Rose Bowl and they're like, we're gonna do- Check this shit out.
3192.10 3193.06 SPEAKER_06  This rules.
3193.06 3200.42 SPEAKER_06  Okay, this is maybe the most like, morally repulsive bit of the film in that-
3200.42 3205.30 SPEAKER_03  Okay, diversity of opinion on the podcast then. I was just thinking rules and you're like, this is evil.
3205.30 3211.14 SPEAKER_06  No, I think it rules, but I think this bit is kind of like if Birth of a Nation was aimed exclusively at Hispanic people.
3211.14 3212.50 SPEAKER_06  Um, it is.
3212.50 3218.26 SPEAKER_06  They kind of, they try to execute him by making him do competitive basketball.
3218.26 3218.82 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
3218.82 3219.38 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
3219.38 3229.94 SPEAKER_06  The, and again, if I lay out the sentence for you, the ethnically affiliated communist gang members try to execute him by making him do competitive basketball.
3229.94 3231.06 SPEAKER_06  That sounds like it could-
3231.06 3232.66 SPEAKER_03  Okay, yeah. Yeah, alright, yeah.
3232.66 3233.62 SPEAKER_03  Do you see where I'm going with this?
3233.62 3235.62 SPEAKER_03  It sounds funny.
3238.10 3245.78 SPEAKER_02  This is another one of those situations, and people love to do this in this movie, where they all stand in a circle and shoot a guy in the middle of them.
3245.78 3246.18 SPEAKER_02  True.
3246.18 3248.66 SPEAKER_02  And none of them ever tend to get shot, and it's like, brother, what-
3248.66 3253.54 SPEAKER_06  Do you remember that bit from Ronin, where Robert De Niro points out this is a stupid idea.
3253.54 3259.62 SPEAKER_02  That's a fucking stupid idea, everyone. But they're like, alright buddy, dunk for your life, white boy, get in there.
3259.62 3261.22 SPEAKER_02  I am- Yeah.
3261.22 3266.74 SPEAKER_06  The fox guy is really getting to him as well, he's like coughing, he's like shuffling, you know.
3266.74 3272.90 SPEAKER_02  It's crazy that they Alexander Litvinenko'd this guy and then were like, alright, go do a fucking mission for us.
3272.90 3275.06 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, they waived him COVID.
3275.06 3277.38 SPEAKER_03  Airdrop him in a Cuba.
3277.38 3278.50 SPEAKER_03  He's got COVID, he needs to lie down.
3278.50 3279.54 SPEAKER_03  He is dying.
3279.54 3285.86 SPEAKER_04  None of this is well thought out by them, it's just like, they thought about everything, but, you know, actually getting the mission done.
3285.86 3286.74 SPEAKER_04  This is awesome.
3286.74 3287.14 SPEAKER_04  And he does-
3287.14 3297.78 SPEAKER_06  What we get is Snake's flu game, because he has to like, make 10 baskets with a shot clock of 10 seconds each, and he does.
3297.78 3310.66 SPEAKER_02  He manages it, like he's fucking dunking the whole time, and like, in the last second, he has to fucking throw this thing the whole way across the court, so he dude perfects this fucking basketball, and there's just silence.
3310.66 3311.14 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3311.14 3322.74 SPEAKER_03  Just insanely- And they say no one has ever walked off that court alive, but the final shot he makes, he just chucks it, gets insanely lucky and just swish, and then he just like walks off the court, and everyone on the ground is like, Snake, Snake, Snake, Snake, Snake.
3322.74 3323.22 SPEAKER_03  It rules.
3323.22 3324.34 SPEAKER_06  It's so good.
3324.34 3324.98 SPEAKER_02  Absolutely rules.
3324.98 3326.98 SPEAKER_06  Cuervo tries to kill him anyway.
3326.98 3329.94 SPEAKER_02  Meanwhile, Utopia realizes she's not built for this.
3329.94 3334.10 SPEAKER_02  Because she's in the audience going like, oh shit, oh no, I didn't know you were going to be killing people.
3334.10 3340.66 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, she's like, we can't have the communists be unambiguously the good guys in this movie, I need to- you're brutal and misogynist, let's not do this.
3340.66 3341.46 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, of course.
3341.46 3341.78 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
3342.98 3345.86 SPEAKER_06  And then you find out that you have some problems leaving the Shining Path.
3345.86 3346.42 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
3346.42 3347.78 SPEAKER_06  You're on the dirty path now.
3347.78 3348.42 SPEAKER_01  Hmm.
3348.42 3357.78 SPEAKER_06  I mean, she like follows him into a storm drain that he escapes from, and right, they fully have Utopia say that Cuervo is worse than her father.
3357.78 3358.66 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
3358.66 3359.54 SPEAKER_04  Which I'm like, I don't know.
3359.54 3361.30 SPEAKER_04  One interaction, by the way.
3361.30 3361.38 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3361.38 3362.58 SPEAKER_04  It just makes that determination.
3362.58 3363.06 SPEAKER_04  I don't know.
3363.06 3371.78 SPEAKER_04  I will say, he is not the only leader, the only person trying to vie for power in this situation.
3371.78 3373.78 SPEAKER_04  Mm-hmm .
3373.78 3381.86 SPEAKER_04  So it's certainly not a statement against anybody who is like anti the fascist system going on, but she's picked the wrong horse in the race.
3381.86 3382.26 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3382.26 3382.74 SPEAKER_04  Of course.
3382.74 3383.22 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3383.22 3383.70 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
3383.70 3386.34 SPEAKER_04  Which could be a little message about the patriarchy.
3386.34 3392.02 SPEAKER_04  It's a very patriarchal sort of system that Cuervo is running here in the Indian, not where the queers are.
3392.02 3407.30 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, we're also led to believe that Cuervo has brainwashed her and has come to her under false pretenses, because we see a little bit of like, she was in VR post a suicide attempt, and Curveso was in there with her as well.
3408.10 3412.66 SPEAKER_02  And we get the little shot of him just like throwing a fucking peace dove at her.
3412.66 3416.34 SPEAKER_02  Different Spanishly named alcohol every time.
3416.34 3416.90 SPEAKER_02  Fucking Corona Jones.
3416.90 3418.90 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, Jose Cuervo was fucking in that.
3418.90 3420.82 SPEAKER_01  It's gross.
3420.82 3422.10 SPEAKER_04  I mean, here's the thing.
3422.10 3440.02 SPEAKER_04  What it really is, and what they're really going after here is she's partially inspired by Patti Hurst, and including the symbolism and everything else here from Patti Hurst being kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army.
3440.02 3441.22 SPEAKER_04  Liberation Army.
3441.22 3442.66 SPEAKER_04  And her getting stalked.
3442.66 3446.02 SPEAKER_04  The people who made the Sybian, they have a Liberation Army.
3446.02 3446.58 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3446.58 3450.50 SPEAKER_06  We'd hate to get liberated by the army of those guys.
3450.50 3454.34 SPEAKER_03  How do I get kidnapped by the Sybianese Liberation?
3454.34 3457.38 SPEAKER_04  And I've spent the holidays with Patti Hurst, and she is a lovely woman.
3457.38 3458.74 SPEAKER_04  But, but...
3458.74 3460.50 SPEAKER_04  Very relaxed now.
3460.50 3460.98 SPEAKER_04  She is.
3460.98 3462.50 SPEAKER_04  She's very chill.
3462.50 3463.46 SPEAKER_04  Down to earth.
3463.46 3464.18 SPEAKER_04  Very chill, wonderful lady.
3464.18 3464.74 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, very funny.
3464.74 3465.86 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, yeah.
3465.86 3467.22 SPEAKER_04  I love Patti.
3467.22 3478.98 SPEAKER_04  But, but this is, this is very clearly inspired by that, including the whole look and her following, you know, her following some, you know, a Liberation Army that was very inspired by that whole system.
3478.98 3479.86 SPEAKER_04  Mm-hmm.
3479.86 3484.90 SPEAKER_04  So, yeah, there's clearly a lot of inspiration that came from that.
3484.90 3491.94 SPEAKER_03  I would hate to find out that a character in a movie was inspired by something that happened to me in real life, and also that they didn't cast me to play that character.
3491.94 3493.14 SPEAKER_03  I would be so upset.
3493.14 3494.14 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3494.14 3498.98 SPEAKER_06  So, Steve Buscemi shoots Snake in the ass and he falls down a storm drain.
3498.98 3499.62 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
3499.62 3499.98 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
3499.98 3500.06 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
3500.06 3508.02 SPEAKER_06  Where he lands with an incredible surf rock, like, riff, lands next to Peter Fonda.
3508.02 3508.50 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
3508.50 3509.02 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3509.02 3509.82 SPEAKER_02  Peter Fonda who goes, fire out, man.
3509.82 3512.42 SPEAKER_02  Who's getting ready to ride the big one.
3512.42 3514.10 SPEAKER_02  It's the big one, yeah.
3514.10 3515.54 SPEAKER_02  There's a fucking tsunami coming.
3515.54 3516.42 SPEAKER_02  They're gonna ride it.
3516.42 3517.42 SPEAKER_02  Um, but...
3517.42 3518.42 SPEAKER_02  Because there's an aftershock.
3518.42 3528.90 SPEAKER_02  Eddie takes, um, Utopia and the, like, black box back to, to Chavezza crystal and is like, listen, I've, I don't have a second joke.
3528.90 3530.90 SPEAKER_02  And is like, but I got it.
3530.90 3531.38 SPEAKER_02  I got it all.
3531.38 3531.94 SPEAKER_02  I shot the guy.
3531.94 3533.14 SPEAKER_02  I did it all, pal.
3533.14 3533.54 SPEAKER_02  Bam.
3533.54 3534.26 SPEAKER_02  I'm your man.
3534.26 3538.50 SPEAKER_02  And, and, uh, Jones is like, I don't see the fucking body.
3538.50 3541.54 SPEAKER_02  Go and get Snake's body for me, man.
3541.54 3543.54 SPEAKER_03  Eddie keeps offering to represent people.
3543.54 3548.86 SPEAKER_03  He keeps talking, he offers to represent Snake after he's hit him with the nipple-piercing talk.
3548.86 3549.86 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, really.
3549.86 3550.86 SPEAKER_03  He's still trying to be an agent.
3550.86 3551.86 SPEAKER_04  Okay, but it's an ambulance, let's be honest.
3551.86 3554.34 SPEAKER_04  This is, I've met this guy.
3554.34 3556.58 SPEAKER_04  This is 95% of the agents in Hollywood.
3556.58 3563.62 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, I met this guy at the Emmys and then he sent me a thing, but like, you should play a trans sex worker on Lord or SBU and I was like, no, dog.
3563.62 3564.62 SPEAKER_06  Thank you.
3564.62 3572.46 SPEAKER_06  So, so Snake has to, he sees, he sees Steve Buscemi driving next to the, like, uh, like drainage thing.
3572.46 3573.46 SPEAKER_06  They're surfing.
3573.46 3574.46 SPEAKER_06  He's fucking surfing.
3574.46 3575.46 SPEAKER_03  But he buried the lead.
3575.46 3576.46 SPEAKER_03  They surf a tsunami.
3576.46 3577.46 SPEAKER_03  They surf the fucking tsunami.
3577.46 3578.46 SPEAKER_03  It rules.
3578.46 3579.46 SPEAKER_02  It rules.
3579.46 3580.46 SPEAKER_02  It rips piss.
3580.46 3582.46 SPEAKER_02  There's no reason for it to be in the movie, but it's there.
3582.46 3583.46 SPEAKER_02  It fucking rocks.
3583.46 3584.46 SPEAKER_02  This is, this is peak cinema.
3584.46 3585.46 SPEAKER_02  It rules.
3585.46 3588.46 SPEAKER_04  Peak cinema is seeing a car chase.
3588.46 3591.46 SPEAKER_02  They're playing the surfer music the whole fucking time.
3591.46 3592.46 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3592.46 3603.46 SPEAKER_04  A car chase with Steve Buscemi in a vintage, perfect vehicle in the dystopia, being chased by a surfing Kurt Russell.
3603.46 3605.46 SPEAKER_03  Surfing Cyclops Kurt Russell.
3605.46 3606.46 SPEAKER_03  Kurt Russell.
3606.46 3616.46 SPEAKER_06  You get a shot of Kurt Russell, like, surfing revengefully, which is the best combination of, like, activity and mood I can think of.
3616.46 3617.46 SPEAKER_06  Yeah!
3617.46 3619.46 SPEAKER_06  Approaching you at surfing pace.
3619.46 3622.46 SPEAKER_06  You're like surfing, but with like, really, your mind on revenge, you know?
3622.46 3623.46 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, yeah.
3623.46 3624.46 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
3624.46 3635.46 SPEAKER_04  The fact that Snake Blisken not just surfs next to this, but outmatches a vintage Corvette by, like, catching up to it on a surfboard.
3635.46 3636.46 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3636.46 3640.46 SPEAKER_04  It is, this is cinema, this is the art of filmmaking right here.
3640.46 3641.46 SPEAKER_02  It's fucking great.
3641.46 3645.46 SPEAKER_02  He absolutely surfmogs this fucking car cell, like, no problem at all.
3645.46 3646.46 SPEAKER_02  Jumps right into the back of it.
3647.46 3649.46 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, he surfs into the back of this car.
3649.46 3651.46 SPEAKER_02  This kind of surfable mixed-use urbanism.
3651.46 3659.46 SPEAKER_02  I wrote, sorry, my note for about the basketball stuff, this is plain awesome, no analysis here.
3659.46 3666.46 SPEAKER_02  At this point in the movie I wrote, no other movie is ever gonna look this good again, and I kind of mean that as well.
3666.46 3667.46 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, that is true.
3667.46 3673.46 SPEAKER_02  It's all at night, it's all on fucking film, it's just, it's, the movie looks so good.
3673.46 3677.46 SPEAKER_02  Like, it's all practical, even like the joke cutaway cars.
3677.46 3690.46 SPEAKER_02  Like, there's a bit earlier on just after, um, Taslima gets killed, where a bunch of kids all fire off Mac-10s and then get into this fucking, like, fire decaled old car.
3690.46 3692.46 SPEAKER_02  And it's all practical, it's real.
3692.46 3693.46 SPEAKER_02  Just for a joke.
3693.46 3698.46 SPEAKER_02  Like, the amount of set dressing that is being put to this is just incredible.
3698.46 3699.46 SPEAKER_02  I love it.
3699.46 3700.46 SPEAKER_02  It's all practical.
3700.46 3703.46 SPEAKER_02  Apart from the tsunami.
3703.46 3704.46 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3704.46 3705.46 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3705.46 3710.46 SPEAKER_04  What's devastating to me is that this is how I feel Batman films should look.
3710.46 3711.46 SPEAKER_04  Right?
3711.46 3712.46 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3712.46 3723.46 SPEAKER_04  And we, and we have not been anywhere close to that since sadly, like, Schumacher was almost on the right track before it got too campy and too child, like, like, too child aiming.
3723.46 3727.46 SPEAKER_04  But this sort of dystopian, this is what Gotham City should look like.
3727.46 3728.46 SPEAKER_04  Totally.
3728.46 3733.46 SPEAKER_04  This is an environment I can see Batman and characters like Clayface and Poison Ivy being.
3733.46 3734.46 SPEAKER_01  Like Riddler and shit.
3734.46 3735.46 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3735.46 3738.46 SPEAKER_04  Now everything, even when they do gritty, looks too fucking clean.
3738.46 3739.46 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3739.46 3740.46 SPEAKER_04  It looks way too clean.
3740.46 3743.46 SPEAKER_04  It looks way too unrealistically clean.
3743.46 3750.46 SPEAKER_04  This looks like a more dystopian version of what the worst parts of Los Angeles currently look like.
3750.46 3751.46 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3751.46 3762.46 SPEAKER_03  And I can actually explain why this is because it's so prohibitively expensive now to rent actual filming locations that most films now have to be shot either in like studios on like constructed sets or on green screens.
3762.46 3771.46 SPEAKER_03  And those do look clean because you build the set and then like you distress it a little bit, but you can never really distress it in an organic way the way a real street is distressed.
3771.46 3777.46 SPEAKER_03  So you don't shoot kind of on real streets anymore because it's too fucking expensive to pay the rent.
3777.46 3778.46 SPEAKER_02  Sucks.
3778.46 3779.46 SPEAKER_02  Sucks.
3779.46 3780.46 SPEAKER_02  Fucking sucks.
3780.46 3783.46 SPEAKER_03  But at this point Snake is like, right Eddie, are you going to help me here?
3783.46 3784.46 SPEAKER_03  And we've got to stop Weber Jones.
3784.46 3788.46 SPEAKER_03  And Eddie's like, okay, well in that case I've got to take you to my ally, Hershey.
3788.46 3789.46 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3789.46 3793.46 SPEAKER_03  And listen, you may have thought this film sounded cool already, but...
3793.46 3796.46 SPEAKER_06  Using Hershey pronouns.
3796.46 3797.46 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
3797.46 3806.46 SPEAKER_04  This is, there's so much to Hershey because this is simultaneously the best problematic character I can think of in a film.
3806.46 3807.46 SPEAKER_04  For real.
3807.46 3808.46 SPEAKER_04  Yes.
3808.46 3809.46 SPEAKER_06  I agree.
3809.46 3812.46 SPEAKER_06  I can't stay mad at this at all.
3812.46 3813.46 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
3813.46 3814.46 SPEAKER_06  In fact, I can't really get mad at this.
3814.46 3819.46 SPEAKER_06  I'm like, conceptually, I'm like, this is not great, but I'm having the time of my life.
3819.46 3823.46 SPEAKER_06  So they have to go to the like, beached Queen Mary, like ocean line.
3823.46 3826.46 SPEAKER_06  This is really funny, but it's the wreck of the Queen Mary.
3826.46 3827.46 SPEAKER_02  Fallout 3 location.
3827.46 3828.46 SPEAKER_02  Uh-huh.
3828.46 3835.46 SPEAKER_03  To meet another gang, led by Hershey, and she's a fucking trans woman.
3835.46 3836.46 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3836.46 3837.46 SPEAKER_02  Pam Grier.
3837.46 3838.46 SPEAKER_02  Played by?
3838.46 3839.46 SPEAKER_03  Pam fucking Grier.
3839.46 3840.46 SPEAKER_03  Pam Grier.
3840.46 3841.46 SPEAKER_03  Gorgeous.
3841.46 3845.46 SPEAKER_04  And badass as fuck with an entire vibe going here.
3845.46 3851.46 SPEAKER_06  The voice Pam Grier is doing for this character is so fucking-
3851.46 3855.46 SPEAKER_02  I think they just pitch shifted Pam Grier down a bit.
3855.46 3859.46 SPEAKER_03  To be the one to tell you this, but they lowered her voice in post. They did.
3859.46 3860.46 SPEAKER_03  They 100% did.
3860.46 3861.46 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3861.46 3862.46 SPEAKER_03  By an octave and a half.
3862.46 3863.46 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3863.46 3867.46 SPEAKER_02  And I hate- I can't be the one on the podcast who says it, but this is unbelievably Conti.
3867.46 3868.46 SPEAKER_02  I know it's offensive.
3868.46 3872.46 SPEAKER_02  I know it's not good, but it's so good.
3872.46 3876.46 SPEAKER_04  It's really offensive, but it's also very hot.
3876.46 3877.46 SPEAKER_04  Here's the problem.
3877.46 3879.46 SPEAKER_04  This is where I'll give it to you.
3879.46 3884.46 SPEAKER_04  Pam Grier, in this film as Hershey, is fucking hot.
3884.46 3885.46 SPEAKER_04  Yes!
3885.46 3886.46 SPEAKER_01  Thank you!
3886.46 3887.46 SPEAKER_04  She is sexy.
3887.46 3888.46 SPEAKER_04  She is powerful.
3888.46 3889.46 SPEAKER_04  Oh yeah.
3889.46 3892.46 SPEAKER_04  She is the leader of the gangs, and she is highly respected.
3892.46 3893.46 SPEAKER_04  Oh yeah.
3893.46 3906.46 SPEAKER_04  Unfortunately, not respected by Snake Plissken, which I am not pleased with in this film, but she has the respect of the entire massive, powerful gang she represents here that does not question her.
3906.46 3909.46 SPEAKER_04  I love that Pam Grier did not shave her pits in this.
3909.46 3910.46 SPEAKER_04  Hell yeah.
3910.46 3913.46 SPEAKER_04  She has these colorful dreadlocks, this entire outfit.
3913.46 3916.46 SPEAKER_04  She is serving in this film.
3916.46 3923.46 SPEAKER_03  Not shaving the pits was probably meant to be slightly offensive at the time, but it's like come back around now that enough trans women don't- That it's actually like-
3923.46 3927.46 SPEAKER_06  I don't care that you intended to offend me. I think this is too cool.
3927.46 3928.46 SPEAKER_06  I'm still turned on, yeah.
3928.46 3932.46 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, it's like you aimed to offend me, but you misfired, pal.
3932.46 3933.46 SPEAKER_02  I'm fucking right here.
3933.46 3936.46 SPEAKER_04  Here's the thing though, she shaves- she is smooth everywhere else.
3936.46 3937.46 SPEAKER_04  She shaved everything but the pits.
3937.46 3938.46 SPEAKER_04  That is a statement piece.
3938.46 3939.46 SPEAKER_04  That's come.
3939.46 3941.46 SPEAKER_04  That is not unkept.
3941.46 3942.46 SPEAKER_04  That is a statement.
3942.46 3947.46 SPEAKER_02  Meanwhile, all of her bodyguards are like a who's who of fucking Hollywood stuntman action guys.
3947.46 3954.46 SPEAKER_02  You've got fucking Al Leong, you've got fucking Jeff Imada, like these are just guys that I absolutely love to see.
3954.46 3957.46 SPEAKER_02  The whole movie is full of like dad ticklers, right?
3957.46 3958.46 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3958.46 3962.46 SPEAKER_02  Like guys that will show up and cause your dad to stand up and be like, holy shit, it's this guy!
3962.46 3965.46 SPEAKER_02  And slash old me as well, I suppose.
3965.46 3966.46 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3966.46 3968.46 SPEAKER_06  And I think all of us to an extent- All of us.
3968.46 3969.46 SPEAKER_03  All of us.
3969.46 3973.46 SPEAKER_03  To bring it back to Hershey, Pam Grier, you may know this, is a cisgender woman.
3973.46 3974.46 SPEAKER_03  She is.
3974.46 3976.46 SPEAKER_03  A cis actor playing a trans woman.
3976.46 3981.46 SPEAKER_03  But the way that you do that right- Kwang Dong-kyuk, are you listening?
3981.46 3987.46 SPEAKER_03  The way that you do that right is you cast a cis woman to play the trans woman.
3987.46 3988.46 SPEAKER_03  That is how you do it.
3988.46 3992.46 SPEAKER_03  If you have to cast a cis actor, you cast a cis actor of the correct gender.
3992.46 3994.46 SPEAKER_03  Are you fucking listening to me?
3994.46 3997.46 SPEAKER_03  How have we gone backwards on this since 1996?
3997.46 3999.46 SPEAKER_03  Fuck you, Squid Game.
3999.46 4002.46 SPEAKER_02  I don't care how good of a job Eddie Redmayne did.
4002.46 4003.46 SPEAKER_02  She should have been a woman.
4003.46 4004.46 SPEAKER_02  No.
4004.46 4006.46 SPEAKER_03  And you, Hillary Swank.
4006.46 4009.46 SPEAKER_04  But, look, here's the thing.
4009.46 4013.46 SPEAKER_04  I so wish they didn't pitch down her voice.
4013.46 4018.46 SPEAKER_04  If they did not pitch down her voice, this would have gotten at least 20 points extra fucking badass from me.
4018.46 4020.46 SPEAKER_04  They just had to do that part.
4020.46 4023.46 SPEAKER_06  Listen, it's valid to not do voice work.
4023.46 4024.46 SPEAKER_04  It is.
4024.46 4025.46 SPEAKER_04  It is.
4025.46 4027.46 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, but she doesn't sound like a deep voice.
4027.46 4028.46 SPEAKER_04  She sounds like somebody.
4028.46 4032.46 SPEAKER_04  Like, it's clear that that's a voice picture down digitally to me.
4032.46 4033.46 SPEAKER_04  That's the problem with it.
4033.46 4037.46 SPEAKER_04  If Pam had just done a huskier voice, that would have been so much better.
4037.46 4050.46 SPEAKER_04  But I love that, like, when Snake Bliskin realizes that this is an old, like, somebody who he used to work with before, like, she transitioned, like, he goes in between her legs.
4050.46 4051.46 SPEAKER_04  Mm-hmm.
4051.46 4053.46 SPEAKER_04  But the way he does so is really sensual.
4053.46 4059.46 SPEAKER_04  He really just reaches up between this trans woman's fucking legs to, like, check it and then pulls out a gun.
4059.46 4060.46 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
4060.46 4061.46 SPEAKER_04  Of course.
4061.46 4062.46 SPEAKER_04  Like, it's played off.
4062.46 4064.46 SPEAKER_04  You almost think Snake Bliskin's gonna give her a handy.
4064.46 4065.46 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
4065.46 4066.46 SPEAKER_04  He goes in for the gun, yeah.
4066.46 4070.46 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, actually, Snake is the only person who does not respect her gender and consistently deadnames her.
4070.46 4072.46 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, he deadnames her every time.
4072.46 4076.46 SPEAKER_03  To the end, she saves his fucking life and he's still deadnaming her.
4076.46 4077.46 SPEAKER_06  Sacrifices herself, yeah.
4077.46 4081.46 SPEAKER_02  Because there was reference made to something happening in Cleveland, right?
4081.46 4083.46 SPEAKER_02  I don't know what the fuck that was.
4083.46 4085.46 SPEAKER_02  I don't know if it's explained in Escape from New York.
4085.46 4086.46 SPEAKER_02  I didn't watch it.
4086.46 4087.46 SPEAKER_02  No.
4087.46 4090.46 SPEAKER_02  In Cleveland, the movie 1.5 was like a tie-in comic.
4090.46 4093.46 SPEAKER_02  The fucking prequel to Escape from Cleveland.
4093.46 4096.46 SPEAKER_02  But, like, she was called Carjack Malone, right?
4096.46 4097.46 SPEAKER_02  Mm-hmm.
4097.46 4100.46 SPEAKER_02  And Snake knew her before she transitioned and things like that.
4100.46 4101.46 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
4101.46 4105.46 SPEAKER_02  But he calls her Carjack like three times and it's like, brother, come on.
4105.46 4106.46 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
4106.46 4108.46 SPEAKER_02  And also the entire time he's like fucking dying.
4108.46 4110.46 SPEAKER_02  He's just like throwing up in the corner.
4110.46 4111.46 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
4111.46 4122.46 SPEAKER_06  The sickest cis man you have ever seen arrives at your home, deadnames you 50 times, tries to like grab the gun that you keep where you used to keep your dick.
4122.46 4125.46 SPEAKER_06  And you're like, yeah, I guess I'll help him.
4125.46 4126.46 SPEAKER_06  You know, I don't have anything else going on.
4126.46 4127.46 SPEAKER_06  Just like, yeah.
4127.46 4128.46 SPEAKER_06  I suppose.
4128.46 4130.46 SPEAKER_06  That is trans-feminine decision making at work.
4130.46 4131.46 SPEAKER_06  Like, that's representation.
4131.46 4133.46 SPEAKER_03  Well, if Barbara Jones takes over the world, she's gonna be number two.
4133.46 4135.46 SPEAKER_03  And she's like, I wanna be in LA when that happens.
4135.46 4136.46 SPEAKER_03  I'm gonna be number one.
4136.46 4142.46 SPEAKER_03  So, she's gonna help him get to the Happy Kingdom, which is what we're calling Disney.
4142.46 4146.46 SPEAKER_06  Don't have the rights for Disneyland or the Magic Kingdom, so yeah, the Happy Kingdom.
4146.46 4147.46 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, Happy Kingdom.
4147.46 4151.46 SPEAKER_03  We're gonna get there, we're gonna retrieve the black box, and then we are going to escape from LA.
4151.46 4152.46 SPEAKER_03  Huh.
4152.46 4154.46 SPEAKER_03  But how are we gonna get there?
4154.46 4156.46 SPEAKER_03  In the sickest way possible.
4156.46 4157.46 SPEAKER_02  Guess what, bitch?
4157.46 4158.46 SPEAKER_02  Gliders.
4158.46 4161.46 SPEAKER_03  By hang gliding over the burning Hollywood sign.
4161.46 4162.46 SPEAKER_03  Fucking rules.
4162.46 4163.46 SPEAKER_02  This movie fucking rules.
4163.46 4183.46 SPEAKER_04  This is, again, as I said, we said that continuously throughout watching it when Abby was over at my place, where every single time they introduce a new insane element into this, where it's just like, oh, they're not just meeting the baddie trans gang leader of Los Angeles, but they're hang gliding into battle.
4183.46 4184.46 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
4184.46 4185.46 SPEAKER_04  Sick.
4185.46 4189.46 SPEAKER_04  Every ten moments, it's a new glorious creative decision.
4189.46 4195.46 SPEAKER_03  I feel like geographically that doesn't work to go from the coast to the Hollywood sign to Anaheim, but whatever.
4195.46 4199.46 SPEAKER_03  That's what they do, they hang glide to fucking Disneyland.
4199.46 4201.46 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, it works cinematically.
4201.46 4203.46 SPEAKER_03  That's about it.
4203.46 4206.46 SPEAKER_03  Oh, the burning Hollywood Hills sign.
4206.46 4212.46 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, Guero has demanded a government chopper to come and pick him up from Disneyland, so that lands and gets immediately jacked.
4212.46 4213.46 SPEAKER_03  Yes.
4213.46 4216.46 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, a bunch of guys come up to it and press triangle.
4216.46 4223.46 SPEAKER_02  Steve Buscemi gets there early and is like, brother, hey, it's me, Steve Buscemi.
4223.46 4224.46 SPEAKER_02  I'm still in the movie.
4224.46 4227.46 SPEAKER_02  They're coming to kill you, pal!
4227.46 4230.46 SPEAKER_02  And he's just very evasive about all of his points.
4230.46 4232.46 SPEAKER_02  He's got total plot armor at this point.
4232.46 4234.46 SPEAKER_02  Everyone is trying to kill him.
4234.46 4235.46 SPEAKER_02  No one is succeeding.
4235.46 4237.46 SPEAKER_02  They pull a gun to his head.
4237.46 4239.46 SPEAKER_04  By the way, they do not go to Disneyland.
4239.46 4242.46 SPEAKER_04  They go to the Happy Kingdom by the sea.
4242.46 4249.46 SPEAKER_04  Because apparently early in the film, they're able to make a Universal Studios joke, but they do not cross Disney in this film.
4249.46 4250.46 SPEAKER_01  Interesting.
4250.46 4255.46 SPEAKER_04  So Universal Studios isn't called like, you know, Earth World or something like that.
4255.46 4258.46 SPEAKER_04  They use that name, but they will not cross Disney.
4258.46 4259.46 SPEAKER_06  Planetary Studios.
4259.46 4261.46 SPEAKER_06  So, yeah.
4261.46 4269.16 SPEAKER_06  So Steve Buscemi tries to like do a switch with the like fucking MacGuffin device.
4269.46 4270.46 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
4270.46 4271.46 SPEAKER_06  Unsuccessfully.
4271.46 4274.46 SPEAKER_06  And a fight breaks out.
4274.46 4275.46 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
4275.46 4277.46 SPEAKER_03  Snake and Hershey attack from the sky.
4277.46 4279.46 SPEAKER_03  There's like flames going off and shit.
4279.46 4281.46 SPEAKER_03  The hang gliders aren't behaving remotely like real.
4281.46 4282.46 SPEAKER_03  It's so good.
4282.46 4283.46 SPEAKER_03  It's such a fucking good scene.
4283.46 4286.46 SPEAKER_06  He's really making a point to deadname her every couple of minutes.
4286.46 4287.46 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
4287.46 4289.46 SPEAKER_03  This woman is saving your life.
4289.46 4290.46 SPEAKER_03  Like, I'd be careful.
4290.46 4291.46 SPEAKER_03  She has a gun.
4291.46 4293.46 SPEAKER_03  She's helping you out here.
4293.46 4294.46 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
4294.46 4297.46 SPEAKER_02  So he's like hang gliding around and shooting at these guys.
4297.46 4303.46 SPEAKER_02  Um, Huevo Gold and his fine Colombians get into like a proper, proper toss up with all of them.
4303.46 4305.46 SPEAKER_02  Uh, it's a Steady Dan reference.
4305.46 4306.46 SPEAKER_02  I'm sorry.
4306.46 4307.46 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
4307.46 4308.46 SPEAKER_04  Him and Snake have a fight.
4308.46 4323.46 SPEAKER_04  I'll also say once again, just reminding the audience that I, I do not believe the transphobia coming from Plissken for a second in this considering once again, he spent, he spent all of his time in Thailand, New Vegas.
4323.46 4324.46 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
4324.46 4330.46 SPEAKER_04  There is no way in this world that is not the capital of trans bitches.
4330.46 4333.46 SPEAKER_02  There's no- Thailand, New Vegas, the gang's called the Queens, you know?
4333.46 4334.46 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
4334.46 4335.46 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
4335.46 4344.46 SPEAKER_04  There's absolutely no way that, that, that, that Snake Plissken wasn't very familiar in many ways with hot trans bitches in Thailand, New Vegas.
4344.46 4345.46 SPEAKER_04  There's no way.
4345.46 4346.46 SPEAKER_03  He knows, he knows.
4346.46 4349.46 SPEAKER_03  He clocks it by her voice too, which is so mean.
4349.46 4355.46 SPEAKER_03  But anyway, uh, they have a fight and, uh, Snake gets the, gets the black box with the Damocles remote in it, gets back into the chopper.
4355.46 4361.46 SPEAKER_02  I will say, halfway through this fight, Huevo starts gnawing on Kurt Russell's inner thigh and I'm like, yep, two among us.
4361.46 4362.46 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, it's quite, yeah.
4362.46 4364.46 SPEAKER_02  Got distracted midway through this fight.
4364.46 4365.46 SPEAKER_02  Uh huh.
4365.46 4368.46 SPEAKER_02  Um, but they do get into the helicopter, yeah.
4368.46 4369.46 SPEAKER_03  Everyone jumps in.
4369.46 4371.46 SPEAKER_03  Steve Buscemi shoots Cuervo Jones.
4371.46 4372.46 SPEAKER_03  With a harpoon gun.
4372.46 4373.46 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
4373.46 4374.46 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
4374.46 4375.46 SPEAKER_03  He kills his ass.
4375.46 4379.46 SPEAKER_02  He goes like, got his ass and then Cuervo shoots off this fucking rocket launcher.
4379.46 4385.46 SPEAKER_02  Um, and Buscemi jumps out and Pam Grier gets fucking incinerated.
4385.46 4386.46 SPEAKER_02  Yeah!
4386.46 4387.46 SPEAKER_02  In the backseat!
4387.46 4388.46 SPEAKER_02  Yep.
4388.46 4393.46 SPEAKER_02  Just, this is a hardcore Henry level of just fridging broads the second you're done with them being in your movie.
4393.46 4395.46 SPEAKER_02  Just like, ah, whatever, fuck it, kill him, I don't care.
4395.46 4398.46 SPEAKER_02  Zero, zero dollardarity, baby.
4398.46 4399.46 SPEAKER_02  What are you doing?
4399.46 4402.46 SPEAKER_04  It's also not mentioned again.
4402.46 4403.46 SPEAKER_04  It is not mentioned at all.
4403.46 4408.46 SPEAKER_06  It's equality, like you're treating trans women as women, in that you are killing this almost instantly.
4408.46 4409.46 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
4409.46 4416.46 SPEAKER_03  Utopia's here too, so it's Utopia and Snake flying back to the mainland in this like, chopper that's on fire.
4416.46 4421.46 SPEAKER_03  Um, and so they crash land outside the base.
4421.46 4422.46 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
4422.46 4431.46 SPEAKER_06  And so the president and the like, cops who sent him on this mission are ready to pick him up and they're like, uh, and he wants the antidote, right?
4431.46 4436.46 SPEAKER_06  The antidote to the virus that is about to kill him in like ten seconds from now.
4436.46 4439.46 SPEAKER_06  The flu toxin running through his veins.
4439.46 4440.46 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
4440.46 4446.46 SPEAKER_06  These fucking, these jackass forever ass, it's like fucking, just go, ah, we got you again!
4446.46 4450.46 SPEAKER_06  You're the most easily pranked man in the world.
4451.46 4453.46 SPEAKER_03  It's constantly getting clowned on.
4453.46 4457.46 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, we just gave you a mild case of the flu, you're gonna be fine.
4457.46 4462.46 SPEAKER_06  And it's like, this guy was visibly like, dying like ten minutes ago.
4462.46 4463.46 SPEAKER_03  Hmm.
4463.46 4465.46 SPEAKER_03  But they're like, hey, you did it, you're a war hero.
4465.46 4466.46 SPEAKER_03  So give us back the remote.
4466.46 4468.46 SPEAKER_03  And also they've arrested Utopia.
4468.46 4476.46 SPEAKER_03  Um, and then the general, general ponytail searches her and finds a duplicate remote and he's like, Snake's done a switch, this is the real remote, we've got the real one.
4476.46 4482.46 SPEAKER_03  And the president's like, great, cool, execute both of them, time for me to do my worldwide broadcast, fuck you.
4482.46 4489.46 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, he fully does just sentence his own daughter to electrocution for the crime of like wearing a crop top, essentially.
4490.46 4494.46 SPEAKER_06  Um, which is, I guess, very Pam Buchanan, you can't argue with that, but uh...
4494.46 4505.46 SPEAKER_04  I mean, look, I'm not gonna lie, there are certain right wing figures who have condemned their disobedient children.
4505.46 4506.46 SPEAKER_04  That's very true.
4506.46 4507.46 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, absolutely.
4507.46 4508.46 SPEAKER_04  That's very true.
4508.46 4509.46 SPEAKER_03  Absolutely.
4509.46 4513.46 SPEAKER_04  Not gonna mention specific names, but I'm going out for pizza with one of them this week.
4513.46 4514.46 SPEAKER_04  Hell yeah.
4514.46 4515.46 SPEAKER_04  But it's like...
4515.46 4516.46 SPEAKER_01  Give him my love.
4516.46 4518.46 SPEAKER_02  We gotta get her on the pot.
4518.46 4519.46 SPEAKER_02  I will, she's fucking awesome.
4519.46 4520.46 SPEAKER_02  Shit, that's a good idea, Devon.
4520.46 4523.46 SPEAKER_03  Ask her if she knows any good movies about masculinity.
4523.46 4525.46 SPEAKER_04  Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure, I'm sure she does.
4525.46 4526.46 SPEAKER_04  I'm sure she does.
4526.46 4527.46 SPEAKER_04  We'll get her on the pot.
4527.46 4528.46 SPEAKER_04  Are you going to Lucifer's?
4528.46 4529.46 SPEAKER_04  Oh yeah, definitely.
4529.46 4532.46 SPEAKER_04  I'm going to the most satanic-themed pizza place in LA, for sure.
4532.46 4535.46 SPEAKER_04  But, you know, this is, I could see this happening.
4535.46 4542.46 SPEAKER_04  If, say, Ivanka, if Ivanka Trump did a big swap over...
4542.46 4543.46 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
4543.46 4551.46 SPEAKER_04  ...and decided, I'm turning against my father, I'm with the left, you know, the leftist now, I'm anti-fascist, all of that.
4551.46 4552.46 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
4552.46 4559.46 SPEAKER_04  Trump would 100% throw her under the bus within seconds of her questioning his power.
4559.46 4562.46 SPEAKER_04  This is very much this move.
4562.46 4565.46 SPEAKER_04  Like, anybody who thinks that these people, it's like, oh, what if it was your child?
4565.46 4566.46 SPEAKER_04  They would not care.
4566.46 4567.46 SPEAKER_04  They would not care.
4567.46 4577.46 SPEAKER_04  The way that these people view their children is, you are an extension of my beliefs and my legacy, and if you go against that, then disown.
4577.46 4578.46 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, totally.
4578.46 4585.46 SPEAKER_06  So, just in case the movie, you know, just in case you're unclear that these are, you know, Nazis, right?
4585.46 4587.46 SPEAKER_06  The movie decides to get...
4587.46 4590.46 SPEAKER_06  Even that last little grain of subtlety is gone.
4590.46 4596.46 SPEAKER_06  There is an interesting wrinkle here where Snake's like, okay, fine, whatever, here's your shit.
4596.46 4597.46 SPEAKER_06  Can I have a cigarette?
4597.46 4603.46 SPEAKER_06  And General Ponytail is like, the United States is a non-smoking nation.
4603.46 4609.46 SPEAKER_06  No, no, like, no cigarettes, no guns, no sex outside marriage, no red meat.
4609.46 4610.46 SPEAKER_06  And I'm like...
4610.46 4615.46 SPEAKER_03  No drinking, no drugs, no foul language, no red meat.
4615.46 4621.46 SPEAKER_06  I feel like this maybe, like, misses some aspects of the new American fascism.
4621.46 4622.46 SPEAKER_06  They didn't really...
4622.46 4624.46 SPEAKER_06  They can't all be hits, you know?
4624.46 4625.46 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
4625.46 4626.46 SPEAKER_04  This is all...
4626.46 4629.46 SPEAKER_04  This is about half of Project 2025.
4629.46 4630.46 SPEAKER_04  Because...
4630.46 4631.46 SPEAKER_01  Yes!
4631.46 4636.46 SPEAKER_04  Project 2025, like, certainly not the red meat thing, because they're all about that to stick it to the vegans.
4636.46 4639.46 SPEAKER_04  But I think a lot of, like, the...
4639.46 4650.46 SPEAKER_04  A lot of the toxic sort of groiper dude bros do forget the fact that the people that Trump has put in charge of certain parts of the country believe in outlawing pornography.
4650.46 4651.46 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, totally.
4651.46 4653.46 SPEAKER_04  And believe in, like, outlawing things like...
4653.46 4654.46 SPEAKER_06  But it's all...
4654.46 4655.46 SPEAKER_06  They're all paleo guys.
4655.46 4656.46 SPEAKER_06  It's only red meat.
4656.46 4657.46 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
4657.46 4658.46 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
4658.46 4661.46 SPEAKER_03  Pornography here meaning, like, anything with a queer person.
4661.46 4664.46 SPEAKER_03  Pornography here having a broad enough definition to include this podcast.
4664.46 4676.46 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, so, like, the president's gonna go on live TV and he's gonna, like, annihilate the, sort of, like, shining path affiliated invasion forces with the, like, fucking doohickey.
4676.46 4677.46 SPEAKER_06  Right?
4677.46 4679.46 SPEAKER_03  He's like, minutes away from landing in Florida, by the way.
4679.46 4680.46 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
4680.46 4681.46 SPEAKER_06  Mm-hmm.
4681.46 4683.46 SPEAKER_06  And they've done the switch again.
4683.46 4684.46 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
4684.46 4687.46 SPEAKER_06  And he has, instead of the doohickey, he's got the maps of the stars.
4687.46 4689.46 SPEAKER_02  He's like, I'm gonna fucking kill all of you.
4689.46 4690.46 SPEAKER_02  This is the final solution.
4690.46 4691.46 SPEAKER_02  Presses the button.
4691.46 4694.46 SPEAKER_02  And it's Steve Buscemi being like, it's the maps of the stars!
4694.46 4695.46 SPEAKER_02  Yeah!
4695.46 4696.46 SPEAKER_02  He's like, da-da-da-da-da.
4696.46 4697.46 SPEAKER_02  It's pretty funny.
4697.46 4701.46 SPEAKER_03  And then they're like, ah, nice job, Snake, well, we've still got you at gunpoint, so...
4701.46 4703.46 SPEAKER_03  So time to kill your ass.
4703.46 4705.46 SPEAKER_03  They shoot Snake, and then...
4705.46 4711.46 SPEAKER_06  They shoot in a big circle towards the center which he's in, and then it's revealed that he's a hologram.
4711.46 4713.46 SPEAKER_06  Which is even worse, because he's not even...
4713.46 4714.46 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
4714.46 4720.46 SPEAKER_04  If there was a time for their bullets, like, in the circle to actually hit each other, this would've been the moment.
4720.46 4722.46 SPEAKER_04  But, no, it doesn't happen.
4722.46 4724.46 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, but he force awakens their ass.
4724.46 4728.46 SPEAKER_06  He's like, he's a hologram the whole time, he's a force ghost.
4728.46 4730.46 SPEAKER_06  And he's there with the real thing.
4730.46 4731.46 SPEAKER_06  That's ant, bitch.
4731.46 4735.46 SPEAKER_06  And he's like, you know what, actually, they reuse a line, right?
4735.46 4747.46 SPEAKER_06  Because, um, when he first meets Pam Grier and, like, tries to, like, go for her gun slash dick, he says, recognizing her transition, the more things change, the more they stay the same.
4747.46 4748.46 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
4748.46 4754.46 SPEAKER_06  And then he uses that same line on the, like, new sort of war between the US and the rest of the world.
4754.46 4755.46 SPEAKER_06  Mm-hmm.
4755.46 4757.46 SPEAKER_06  So he fully hits it with, like, geopolitics?
4757.46 4759.46 SPEAKER_06  It's a lot like meeting a trans woman.
4759.46 4760.46 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
4760.46 4762.46 SPEAKER_02  In that, I don't know what I'm doing.
4762.46 4763.46 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
4763.46 4768.46 SPEAKER_06  And so he dials in the, like, destroy all industrial civilization Ted Kaczynski button.
4768.46 4777.46 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, given the choice between socialist and more barbarism, he ends the world, which I feel like that's an odd choice to make, but whatever.
4777.46 4778.46 SPEAKER_03  He does.
4778.46 4781.46 SPEAKER_03  At this point, the weed gummies had well and truly hit, and I was having a great time.
4781.46 4784.46 SPEAKER_02  He does the fucking world's end gambit, you know?
4784.46 4789.46 SPEAKER_02  Antrims with one eye versus that weird orange blur.
4789.46 4796.46 SPEAKER_02  He types in the whole world code and you get this, the cop, Stacey Keach, by the way, another guy I love to see.
4796.46 4797.46 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, Stacey Keach.
4797.46 4801.46 SPEAKER_02  Is, like, one of the greatest king leaders of all time if you only count Americans.
4801.46 4802.46 SPEAKER_04  Oh, well, yeah.
4802.46 4804.46 SPEAKER_02  One of the top five if you count Brits.
4804.46 4814.46 SPEAKER_02  He's like, fuck, all of our, like, industrialized society, our whole way of life, like, the last 500 years is gonna be wasted if you fucking send that off.
4814.46 4820.46 SPEAKER_02  And it's like, well, it led to this, so fuck you. And he pushes it in, bam.
4820.46 4829.46 SPEAKER_02  Like, fucking EMPs the entire world, all technology stops, you get just enough emergency lighting for the president's daughter to be like, damn, he did it.
4829.46 4831.46 SPEAKER_02  And then, shh. It's perfect.
4831.46 4834.46 SPEAKER_04  Utopia, thrilled. Thrilled.
4834.46 4837.46 SPEAKER_04  He lights an American spirit cigarette.
4837.46 4841.46 SPEAKER_06  Uh-huh. With his old-fashioned matches that they gave him.
4841.46 4847.46 SPEAKER_02  He walks right up to the camera, looks directly into the camera, and it faces back and goes, welcome to the human race.
4847.46 4850.46 SPEAKER_02  And then the fucking credits start, and I'm stood there going, yeah!
4850.46 4851.46 SPEAKER_01  Yeah!
4851.46 4856.46 SPEAKER_01  I think that's morally probably not the right thing to have done in that situation, but like, yeah!
4856.46 4859.46 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, I hope everyone depended on insulin.
4859.46 4861.46 SPEAKER_06  You should have just hit America, pal.
4861.46 4862.46 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
4862.46 4869.46 SPEAKER_04  Here is the thing, though, here is the thing, though, is that it was always... Snake Plissken is pure antihero.
4869.46 4871.46 SPEAKER_04  He does not know what he's doing, yeah.
4871.46 4872.46 SPEAKER_04  Pure antihero.
4872.46 4873.46 SPEAKER_04  Pure antihero.
4873.46 4874.46 SPEAKER_04  Pure antihero.
4874.46 4875.46 SPEAKER_04  Chaotic neutral.
4875.46 4878.46 SPEAKER_04  Kind of a fucking idiot, but badass as all hell.
4878.46 4879.46 SPEAKER_04  Totally.
4879.46 4885.46 SPEAKER_04  So this is very much a move at, you know, it's very in character for him.
4885.46 4893.46 SPEAKER_04  From like the beginning of, you know, Escape from New York, it's like, you know, he's like, I don't care about your flag or your damn president.
4893.46 4894.46 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
4894.46 4896.46 SPEAKER_04  You know, it's like, he doesn't give a fuck.
4896.46 4899.46 SPEAKER_04  He's very kind of, you know, self-serving.
4899.46 4915.46 SPEAKER_04  But in a way that is purely sort of like rebellious and very punk and very, I don't know, every queer person I know, despite the fact that he is problematic in a number of ways, is just in love with this guy.
4915.46 4916.46 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, totally.
4916.46 4923.46 SPEAKER_04  It's hard to not, it's hard not to be like, God, I want, you know, if the apocalypse happens, this is the character that's...
4923.46 4925.46 SPEAKER_04  I've patched sails, shoot up.
4925.46 4926.46 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
4926.46 4929.46 SPEAKER_04  I mean, look, I totally, you know, yeah.
4929.46 4930.46 SPEAKER_04  Come on.
4930.46 4932.46 SPEAKER_04  It's hard not to want to lose an eye after watching this.
4932.46 4943.46 SPEAKER_03  I want them to do Escape from London, it's Snake's trans daughter, it's me, I'm in it, she has to go into London to rescue a package that turns out to be Kurt Russell and it's her dad.
4943.46 4944.46 SPEAKER_03  That's her.
4944.46 4945.46 SPEAKER_03  John Carpenter, call me.
4945.46 4947.46 SPEAKER_03  We'll do Escape from London.
4947.46 4950.46 SPEAKER_06  John Carpenter's pausing his video game, being like, huh?
4950.46 4951.46 SPEAKER_06  Okay.
4951.46 4953.46 SPEAKER_06  John, call us.
4953.46 4962.46 SPEAKER_04  There has been this trend where they are trying to like, do one more go of like classic action stars.
4962.46 4966.46 SPEAKER_04  Like they're trying to do King Conan with Arnold.
4966.46 4973.46 SPEAKER_04  They are trying to do, you know, like a number of different films where they like bring back one of the old guys for one more go.
4973.46 4976.46 SPEAKER_04  And John Carpenter has been trying to do Escape from Earth.
4976.46 4977.46 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
4977.46 4978.46 SPEAKER_04  Forever.
4978.46 4988.46 SPEAKER_04  They've been trying to do one last good Snake Plissken film to make this a trilogy and I would love to see that.
4988.46 5002.46 SPEAKER_04  I would love for everything going on right now in the world, since we are so far past this point that John Carpenter like predicted of 2013, for him to do like, okay, 2042.
5002.46 5003.46 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
5003.46 5005.46 SPEAKER_03  Snake is still alive.
5005.46 5015.46 SPEAKER_06  Snake Plissken fired into space, not in a spacecraft, just like on his own with a post-it note stuck to his forehead that says, fuck you.
5015.46 5020.46 SPEAKER_04  Like, I can't imagine him destroying, like blowing up the Earth.
5020.46 5031.46 SPEAKER_04  I can imagine him escaping with like enough people to go repopulate or something like that, but like him doing something with that film ends with Snake Plissken blows up Earth.
5031.46 5034.46 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, it's like escape from the moon or whatever.
5034.46 5035.46 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
5035.46 5038.46 SPEAKER_02  And it's all set on like a moon colony, but it's a prison and then he blows up the Earth at the end of it.
5038.46 5039.46 SPEAKER_02  Perfect.
5039.46 5040.46 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, perfect.
5040.46 5041.46 SPEAKER_06  Let me write it.
5041.46 5044.46 SPEAKER_06  Well, we've written John Carpenter's next movie.
5044.46 5047.46 SPEAKER_06  Now he has only to cast it.
5047.46 5048.46 SPEAKER_06  Hello.
5048.46 5050.46 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, Bruce Campbell.
5050.46 5051.46 SPEAKER_06  I don't have any other points.
5051.46 5054.46 SPEAKER_03  Would you like an actual trans woman this time, John?
5054.46 5055.46 None  We exist.
5055.46 5058.46 SPEAKER_03  Some of us can even act.
5058.46 5059.46 SPEAKER_03  Who cares?
5059.46 5060.46 SPEAKER_02  Come on, John.
5060.46 5065.46 SPEAKER_02  You want to crew your whole next movie with just sort of like transsexual faggots.
5065.46 5066.46 SPEAKER_02  10 out of 10 smoke shows.
5066.46 5071.46 SPEAKER_02  Like you know that your whole, like casting cis people was a crutch this whole time.
5071.46 5072.46 SPEAKER_03  Hand it over.
5072.46 5073.46 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
5073.46 5074.46 SPEAKER_03  John, take the estrogen.
5074.46 5080.46 SPEAKER_06  Even if you don't get like a John Campbell that way, you can get Hideo Kojima, who is downstream of John Campbell.
5080.46 5084.46 SPEAKER_06  This is the God's work that Hunter Schaefer is doing right now.
5084.46 5085.46 SPEAKER_06  It is, yeah.
5085.46 5092.46 SPEAKER_06  To like infiltrate Hideo Kojima's inner circle and be like, have you considered hiring only trans women?
5092.46 5093.46 SPEAKER_06  So, Hunter.
5093.46 5094.46 SPEAKER_04  Give it up.
5094.46 5107.44 SPEAKER_04  So here's the thing, is that the big difference and the big thing that Hideo Kojima added into his games, which does set him apart from like this era of these John Carpenter's films is Kojima's games are extremely queer.
5107.44 5108.44 SPEAKER_04  They are.
5108.44 5109.44 SPEAKER_04  Yes.
5109.44 5110.44 SPEAKER_04  Yes.
5110.44 5111.44 SPEAKER_04  That's true.
5111.44 5112.44 SPEAKER_04  They are filled with queer characters.
5112.44 5114.44 SPEAKER_04  It is totally not subtle at all.
5114.44 5117.44 SPEAKER_04  And he like has some queer baiting with snake and Otacon.
5117.44 5127.44 SPEAKER_04  It's not even subtle, especially as he like gets more into like, he doesn't even try to hide that he has a giant gay man crush on Mads Mikkelsen and the new Death Stranding games.
5127.44 5130.44 SPEAKER_04  That is so plainly queer.
5130.44 5133.44 SPEAKER_04  He has Hunter in his next game.
5133.44 5145.44 SPEAKER_04  Like, he definitely has taken a lot of the ideas of this dystopian future from the Escape From films and has applied them into Metal Gear Solid in ways that he just wanted to expand on and expand on.
5145.44 5149.44 SPEAKER_04  That's why some cutscenes in Metal Gear are longer than this fucking film.
5149.44 5150.44 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
5150.44 5151.44 SPEAKER_06  So...
5151.44 5156.44 SPEAKER_06  I have only to say, play every Metal Gear game.
5156.44 5158.44 SPEAKER_06  I highly recommend them.
5158.44 5160.44 SPEAKER_06  And this has been Escape From L.A.
5160.44 5162.44 SPEAKER_06  We've escaped from L.A.
5162.44 5165.44 SPEAKER_02  Play every Metal Gear game, watch every John Carpenter movie.
5165.44 5166.44 SPEAKER_02  They're all good.
5166.44 5168.44 SPEAKER_02  All the ones with Kurt Russell in are fucking perfect.
5168.44 5172.44 SPEAKER_06  Think up a bunch of Spanish language alcohol name jokes on your own.
5172.44 5174.44 SPEAKER_06  We'll, you know, because we don't really have time for that.
5174.44 5175.44 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, I didn't have that one.
5175.44 5176.44 SPEAKER_06  It's fine.
5176.44 5177.44 SPEAKER_06  Mezcal Union Jones.
5177.44 5180.44 SPEAKER_06  And Morgana, thank you so much for coming on.
5180.44 5183.44 SPEAKER_06  If the people want more Morgana, where- Morgana, if you will.

5191.44 5193.44 SPEAKER_04  I'm all over that.

5195.44 5197.44 SPEAKER_04  Be sure to watch Class X.
5197.44 5199.44 SPEAKER_04  Be sure to watch Dracula's Ex-Girlfriend.
