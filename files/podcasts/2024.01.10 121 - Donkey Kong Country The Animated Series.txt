a leather bar anyway hello i'm mickey mouse

boats around while tormenting the local cat who owns the boat peter and while on the boat i also
like to play little tunes that are of course fondly remembered classics of minstrelsy oh no in american
popular culture that is me mickey mouse who i am who owns this show and this show owns him me that
is mickey mouse i am the known intellectual property of the worst of all possible worlds yes yes we own
and operate mickey mouse out of mickey mouse right yes and i mickey mouse i'm here to to let you guys
know that i have acquired a bunch of other really interesting ips okay okay uh such as pirates of
the caribbean oh um cinderella okay in general sure yeah and marvel's the avengers oh shit which has
also entered the public domain by my hands so many possible worlds but we got this one
so many possible worlds but we got this one
welcome to the worst of all possible worlds the first and only all public domain podcast i'm the
worst of all possible joshes i'm the worst of all possible aj's and i'm mickey mouse we're not here
today to talk about whistling we're not here today to talk about uh uh mickey mouse no we're here to
talk about something committed war crimes in the 70s i guess i'm just here as chopped uh mickey mouse
uh no we're here to talk about something much much we are talking about donkey kong country not the
games not the games no not the beloved nintendo 64 games there's not much to say about the games they
look nice and they don't play very well i disagree i disagree you think they look bad i think they
look good and i think they play pretty well they play pretty well okay wait are we talking about an
interesting set of like the first few levels and then they kind of lose whatever makes them magical
in my opinion the and i think the modern games go a long way towards sort of extending that longevity
but i still think you can pick up and play those original games and they're a barrel of monkeys you can
sure pick them up and there are monkeys apes and monkeys well diddy's a monkey he's a tail
that's true yeah i did and dixie's a monkey too um but does she have a tail does she just tuck it in
her clothes she tucks it in her clothes it kind of like snakes around like a microphone we're all
doing great and the reason that we're doing great is that i decided to subject brian and aj to four
episodes of the donkey kong country animated series yeah this is a fun little bit of lore for us because
usually josh introduces me to really horrible things that i've missed out on here and there throughout
life shake that bear shake that bear could have gone my whole life without shaking that bear
jerry beans yep jerry beans is good katana thing katana thing yep um hanway forge xl practical katana
i actually introduced this to you josh because i grew up watching television and doing little else
sure aj had activities he was a child actor of course i was appearing on local soap operas i was
yeah name one uh general hospital los angeles edition yeah we actually got in trouble because
uh we actually used mickey mouse before he went into the public domain and that show was canceled
immediately yeah they wouldn't let me mickey mouse break my contract no no and josh you didn't know
what television was until 2008 that's true because of your strict christian reformed upbringing that's
right yeah what was the first show you watched josh um was it general hospital michigan television it
was it was general hospital grand rapids yeah it was actually it was set it was set at butterworth
hospital i i would guess i would guess because of the way grand rapids people are and the way that
they do love their local stuff that josh if you really plumbed the depths of the first tv show you saw
i would not be surprised if it was some sort of like western michigan local access tv joint oh i was
gonna say that yeah i mean if if there was like an actual you know grand rapid soap opera i would
have been in it at some point like that's just well that was down gillian lane really you're not wrong
oh i think so gosh grape kool-aid it's so funny i don't remember either of those lines from that show
i've blocked that show it's almost entirely from my memory good idea oh good idea
so this donkey kong tv show is this weird curiosity that i remember seeing because
yeah at some point pat robertson's tv channel what uh which was originally christian broadcasting
network the one that had commissioned those old christian animes uh the flying house and superbook
yeah uh became the family channel which is where i got my fix for batman 60s batman and
happy days when i was a little kid so because my parents like many parents at this time they took
advantage of the ability to record television onto a vhs cassette tape so we had a bunch of cassette
tapes of classic batman episodes which was pretty good because then batman was not released on home video
format for many decades as one of the like really famous rights disputes oh wow but that was always on
the family channel which of course had pat robertson on with the 700 club which persisted through
and he's now dead but the 700 club still lives on on free form so family channel got bought by news corp
fox made fox family and flooded this channel with new or new ish programming so they commissioned a whole
bunch of new stuff of course i talked about watching that frank peretti horror movie way back in one of
our first episodes hangman's curse all right oh yeah episode is called auto peretic asphyxiation
that we did with our friends the sinister sisters and uh they they had like a heathcliff show they had i was a
uh an eighth grade alien or something like that they had uh oh yeah uh they had that show
oh my knees kids remember yeah they had big wolf on campus oh i actually remember that one yeah and
and and the werewolf he had his friend merton who was a real cut up yeah and and it should be this
was like canadian tv they also brought s club seven over but then they had like new programming and this
this french canadian show donkey kong yeah not not french canadian no no french comma canadian
french comma the english part of canada merton just i'm still stuck on merton he sounds to me
like another character that disney just released into the public domain but one no one really wanted
like it's just like a goozy like summer of the canadian tv show big wolf on campus yeah yeah
he sounds like like a like a caterpillar who's just like oozing you do you want to know what his
do you do you want to know what his character trait is sure he loves yoohoo oh he's much like richard
nixon in that yeah he's drinking yoohoo all the time that is that his one thing is that his gimmick
that he likes yeah well i think he's kind of goth and so he knows stuff about the supernatural
things that the big wolf on campus has to deal with like like he's the giles but so he's a giles
that loves yoohoo this is thrilling um and i wish we could keep talking about this but we're limited
for time yeah but either way i ended up watching a lot of donkey kong country when i was a kid
probably all of it but i didn't watch it frequently because i didn't like it that much with donkey kong
country the animated series they i i know that on on family network fox family that thing
they aired some of the episodes like as a consolidated movie but then they also did air
all of the original they did just like air the episodes yeah there were there were some like home
video releases that kind of squished some movies together right okay um but like what i saw was
half hour tv shows with inexplicable musical numbers got it as you were mentioning brian the
situation with the newly christened fox family channel because after they christened is is correct
yeah that's right it remains christened every time that they started out they have to back close it
yeah yeah spider-man is actually canonically protestant it's true um you know that that
happened the sort of transition was completed in 1998 and so they had so much programming that they
just needed to fill slots with yeah right and so they really were just going out and grabbing whatever
they could now it's worth noting that some of this was because the connections of haim sabin
uh aka the power rangers guy who you know just had a lot of connections with a lot of different
content producers but they were just grabbing whatever they fucking could yeah it's interesting
that that haim sabin or saban uh was also a composer because he composed the theme song to uh another one
of these shows based on a video game so the very first show based on a video game was pac-man
uh i don't know if you've ever seen it no i haven't yes it sucks so bad it was hanna-barbera and i mean
like hanna-barbera was already bad enough i would love to know what was in your head until that moment
you know the quarry where they filmed every power rangers fight yeah okay it's that okay giant man
in a foam mascot pac-man sure this suit okay right giant big round ball or was it like the old pac-man
where he's kind of edge he's got the wedge just the wedge right with yellow legs coming out i'm into
giant pellets and then you just watch a man run around a quarry being chased by ghosts okay so
that's better probably than what we got which is just a wretched show where you have the four ghosts
and then there's like a boss ghost who's like go get pac-man and they're like we're gonna go get
pac-man and then pac-man just kicks their ass and then they go back every single time is there a
ms pac-man yes there is okay they kiss baby too right isn't the baby pac-man is in there it's just
that's the whole show and they made multiple episodes and it was a hit so this was an abc show
okay with hanna-barbera which again like 70s hanna-barbera was bad enough this is the absolute
low point in american animation yeah like we are not winning any sort of fight for aesthetics people
do not watch programs from this time that are animated right um even the movies they really
suffer and when when was this what year this was 82 this was 82 okay so in 83 cbs decides to produce
their own thing which is called saturday supercade so they got they got ruby spears which was two guys
that split off of hanna-barbera okay uh this is again last names and it sounds like it's two chicks
but it's two dudes it actually kind of sounds like a pop singer yeah it's britney spears's uh sister
yeah the other sister shimmy lynn yeah yeah she has so uh ruby spears are actually the two guys that
invented the scooby-doo gang while they were working for hanna-barbera so they left that studio started
their own were never quite as successful also made a bunch of dog shit cartoons uh including
saturday supercade and saturday supercade was a little bit more of like a variety show where you'd
have little shorts based on the properties of different cartoons so they did that for cubert
there were a bunch of cubert shorts okay yeah i've seen i think i've seen those too yeah this also is
the first time that donkey kong got animated for a cartoon oh so donkey kong was in the regular
rotation every week there would be a different donkey kong mario and pauline short oh yeah yeah
donkey kong's voice was provided by the comedian soupy sales what yeah what mario was peter cullen
the voice of optimus prime also weirdly peter cullen was the voice of king kong in the 70s king kong
um pauline was judy strangest i don't know who she is i'm sure she's lovely okay so there were a few
other video games that would get featured on this what was that laser disc one that was in space that
was like dragon's lair but it was in space oh space is it just called space quest i think so
space quest is the is the sierra whatever it's one of those um but then dragon quest did get its own
tv show after this sega's pole position got a tv show i don't even know what you would do with
that it's just cars yeah i got a pole position for that i need you to stop oh that's so dirty
i mickey mouse will have nothing of this kind of lewd behavior don't worry you're not gonna get
dirty i only love fuck mice oh fuck little rodents oh the smaller the better
this has been mickey's mouse corner
and i do have to just say for saturday supercade yes hal smith was on it yes
wait what did he voice um i couldn't see but he yeah he did a i think just a couple of little
minor voices on a couple of shorts he was not one of the regulars there were some other
adventures in odyssey i see the credit on imdb is hal smith as additional voices yeah yeah so this
this show also had voices by dick beals who we had listened to on adventures in odyssey and pete
renaday who we'd listened to on adventures in odyssey and probably some others i think there's some
simpsons voice actors in that mix um but nintendo kind of ran with this for a while right there was
a super mario brothers show well before that there was even a fully animated japanese movie that didn't
come stateside then there was the super mario brothers super show which had live action segments
with captain lou albano and animated segments and boy that show sucked so much fucking dog dick
very very it was it was too many it was too many people like trying to control the property like it
was not it was the writers coming up with ideas and then they had to clear it with the studio heads and
then they had to clear that with nintendo and it was just it was too much like there were too many
barriers yeah it was just there to sell you know breakfast cereal like so many cartoons of the 80s
this was what deke was built on this was the animation studio that we all knew was mispronounced
but always had the small child read out the word deke at the end just so you have to have that in
your head and not go to your parents be like i just saw the dick show mom but you you have seen of
course the video of the guy who just saying it's the same exact thing except that rather than the
child saying it's a guy going dick so yeah super mario brothers super show happens of course we get
like the mega man cartoon there's an american mega man cartoon which is a separate show yeah there's
the legend of zelda cartoon and then there's also yeah excuse me what oh it's horrific the the legend
of zelda cartoon yes excuse me mickey and then there was also captain n yes of course the dreadful
captain in which also is one of the first sources for like major zelda lore by the way if you are
interested in learning a little bit more sort of about these early nintendo shows matt pepraki did a
really great article for polygon uh in june of 2020 which we will link in the notes uh
just wanted to throw that out there as well yeah writing that in the midst of the pandemic so i'm
sure this was a wonderful escape plenty of time it was it was very funny because we're reading that
particular article there were a lot of quotes from the people involved and i was like wow he really
like got a lot of people to respond to this article i'm like oh it was june of 2020 yeah they had nothing
else going on nothing nintendo then kind of lets it all get a little out of hand and of course we get the
infamous fabulously bafflingly terrible movie the super mario brothers movie right which i with bob
hoskins in the career low for him he never wanted to talk about even worse than heart condition which
is saying something yeah he he had the worst time of his life on that thing john liguizamo was trying
his best to like create like a positive set and bob hoskins was just like this movie fucking sucks
it was like the creators of max headroom who had kind of become stratospheric successes overnight it
was a married couple uh which you can see that there might be some problems that emerge from that
and apparently they did they were just awful on set they had to be fired and then they hired a new
director and just the the piss poor reception and bad finances of it really made nintendo skittish about
diluting the power of their product so they said okay we're gonna have lots of merchandising and
shit like that we're not gonna be making so many movies and tv shows but uh in 1997 then yes we do
get a partnership between nintendo and a and i'm just reading straight now from the polygon article
uh french canadian animation company media lab technology now media lab is in association with
a company called nelvana if you ever heard nelvana it's because they did the care bears uh and franklin
yes just gonna quote straight from the article in the u.s the series came over as a quote-unquote
movie a few episodes cut together under the title the legend of the crystal coconut in canada the
series ran for 40 episodes writer simon raciopa raciopa i don't know apologies simon i don't know
how to pronounce your name says the show had a bible with basic rules i don't remember any nintendo led
story restrictions but many of those would have been covered by the fact that it was a kids show
and had a lot of necessary standards to it just because that fact yeah e.g donkey kong was never
going to strangle anyone because no kids show character ever strangles anyone says raciopa
obviously he has not seen my work i'm mickey mouse i keep forgetting that you keep it's weird you're
right here of your ears i'm what they call a hidden mickey oh yeah yeah mickey mickey actually
really good brian that was really good mickey mickey makes his hand it to you it is it is very funny
that we have to record this podcast by entering pirates of the caribbean getting off the boat
which is officially officially the property of the worst of all possible worlds we own we own it
i went to disneyland while i was in california nice did you really uh oh you went around new
years that's a terrible time to go the interesting thing was my sister was like very good at planning
the thing and knew exactly like how to optimize so sure um so i got to go on all the big rides you
know i was able to go on the star wars ones i was able to go on pirates of the caribbean uh splash
mountain space mountain smash mountain i said splash mountain i heard smash mountain i was like what are
you talking about why would you go to fuck no wait okay josh why would you hear smash mountain i don't
know that's why i was so confused you met king karul on the top of smash mountain no i did go on
space mountain um i didn't know that they had that fucking song at the disneyland space mountain
it is so good yeah this is fucking amazing holy cow i've only been on the disney world space mountain
right yeah which is not as good one is so much better yeah yeah disneyland does most everything
better than disney world disney world is bigger but i think it dilutes sort of the fun yeah there's
sort of less charm if you go too far right i'm sorry i'm a disney adult i don't talk about this
much on the podcast uh but i am firmly a disney adult you're mickey mouse i fathered walt disney
that one fateful night he came out of the birth canal located very conveniently on your taint
wait are you saying that i not only fathered but mothered him yes okay oh that that's how my
that's how my sweet produce they have both that's right aj yes very good yeah they stick they stick
their dicks right into their drink your water donkey kong country the animated series aired on
france 2 and canal plus in france yeah uh teletune in canada teletune come on not a serious country
tv tokyo in japan tell a loo and as we had mentioned uh it also received in the united states airings on
fox family network as well as the fox box which is like the saturday morning block yeah like with
digimon and stuff yeah which i don't remember seeing it on saturday mornings but i do remember
seeing it on weekdays on fox family this was sort of nintendo's dipping its toes a little bit into
tv and foreign tv not japanese tv right right and the first iteration of this is also a variety show
sort of like super mario brothers super show which was just called donkey kong world the original
whole thing about donkey kong was just that he was the villain that mario faced off against right he
was the blue doe to mario's popeye that's because donkey kong was originally supposed to be a popeye
game and they couldn't get the license that's right um and then of course mario becomes the villain in
donkey kong jr then in donkey kong 3 you play as just some guy i don't remember his name but you like
shoot like pesticides at donkey kong to get his head into a beehive and nintendo it seems in-house didn't
really know or care to do anything with him right they did mario versus donkey kong again but like as far
as a game starring donkey kong they weren't really flowing with that idea but then the the the limeys
over at rare right well they have some ideas right and and when they built out the donkey kong country
games for the super nintendo that was really when we got donkey kong as a character as we know him with
the necktie right right right right and of course diddy kong with his little red baseball cap yes and
canonically cranky kong is actually the original donkey kong right oh i didn't realize he got older
yep oh they have shorter lifespans than humans that's true kongs do and they're all related or is
that they're like subspecies it's hotter if they're all related it is it is much hotter if this is just a
show about incest but you know it's worth noting too that the whole thing that was so interesting about
the donkey kong country games is that they used they were not 3d games right they incorporated
pre-rendered 3d models and backgrounds and so when it came time to create this donkey kong country
animated series which is going to be based on the super nes games right and also interestingly some
of the ideas from the animated series would also be used in donkey kong 64 yeah unlike like legend of
zelda or super mario brothers super show which kind of played fast and loose with the property
this one was pretty invested in the canon and just remained part of it rare was totally happy to take
stuff back from the tv show for bluster bluster did not make a comeback that's i think that's okay he's a
sex offender yes the show is released interestingly was refused consideration in the best animation emmy
awards category yes uh reason being that rather than like actually animating it instead they did motion
capture where they were bringing in people and doing a very early version of what is now very common
practice yeah uh where you will you know sort of strap a certain uh rig up to somebody you'll record their
performance in 3d and then you'll use that animation to rig up your model yeah right and the technology
was not nearly far along enough to capture like facial movements so what would happen was they
developed this system where one actor would do the body motions for the characters and another uh
puppeteer would put on what a uh what was referred to as data gloves the power glove
where one hand would control the eyebrows and eyes and the other would manipulate the mouth
so they got seasoned puppeteers to do this and i've done uh electronic puppeteering i have puppeteered
virtual reality characters on a couple of occasions and i have a lot of respect for the way this turned
out which is also like this show is hideous everything about it is wrong right but the fact that they were
able to do anything at all with this because you know it's not like a regular puppet where you have the
feedback of handling something physical you're just moving your fucking fingers around
to make mouth shapes and maybe you get to see like a wireframe on a screen while you're doing it
this is nuts this is really crazy but they could put a show an episode of this show together in two
weeks yeah and it would normally take six to eight all this information by the way uh comes from rita
street's 1998 book computer animation a whole new world which you can find on the internet archive and
we will link in the description below but what it does i think this animation style having two people do
it at once is that for me it felt like the body was very disconnected from what the face was doing
at any given time yeah yeah and because it seems like they had to do a lot of like recording of this
in a very short amount of time to get the two-week turnaround it seemed like first take best take oh
yes one taking your golden for sure yeah and like any kind of action that causes a change of state of
something will always happen just out of frame yes you know like there's a scene where matches get lit
and they're there you see their arm moving trying to strike the match and then they lift it back up
and it's on fire right right you do not see the fire happen in real time nobody ever picks anything
up uh rather notably because animating picking something up is pretty complicated as it turns out
and it was it was actually impossible the way they were doing it yeah you have to go back to keyframe
animation which they do sometimes if they need to because they do this in part because they're trying to
at first do this like live action integration which none of the donkey con country show has any
of that it's just an animated show right but some of this is also commercial viability but like a big
part of this is that these people want to play with these new toys that cgi can offer you right they
could have made a traditionally animated cell cell animated show but they didn't because people are
animated by the possibilities that this new tech gives and then the business follows right right compare
that to like some of these ai guys right now who are like i just saw someone make some big viral
post yesterday that was like uh in in just a few months ai animation ai filmmaking will be commercially
viable that's their only thought it's like commercial viability not about the the interesting things that
ai can do when it renders an image in its own particular ways right they try to smooth all that out so
that it just imitates the style of somebody else right because they don't want pesky creatives who can do a
thing they can't do getting in the way of them doing the thing they want and they don't think they can't do it
the thing is they're not interested in the thing right only interested in the financial prospects that the
thing gives them and and the acclaim and they want i don't know i think there is a part of it that's just like
you want to be called a great artist and not have to do anything it's like there was that whole thing where people
were like just because i'm not a talented artist shouldn't mean that i shouldn't get to be an artist and i'm like
here's the thing kind of like also no one's stopping you right yeah just do something yeah and
here's the thing you're gonna get better by doing it but you know ai should be a tool that is used by
actual artists to maybe help out in the process but like this computer generation as it was received
during this donkey kong thing people were just like this is not art what you are doing here is a computer
game i just wanted to unpack that a second like the idea of like using ai as a generative tool not as a
generative tool as a tool to like refine things or like or like be able to like it's been used in you know
photographic sure editing processes for many many years now without any kind of fanfare i guess that's kind of the
point that i wanted to make yeah is that any tool can be used as a tool but there is a difference between uh a using
it as a generative tool like an actual generative medium versus maybe fine-tuning something that you are working on
being like i'm gonna let the computer take care of this particular you know little bit right yeah
this really was though in terms of the animation and you can tell in these early episodes they didn't
really animate very much of it at all and that is why this is just an article here from the la times
june 1 1999 uh to the average viewer the sunday morning children's series donkey kong country looks
pretty much like any other cartoon no it doesn't it absolutely does not but when its producers submitted it for
consideration in the emmy award category of best animation the tv academy said it didn't qualify the rejection
has added fuel to an ongoing debate over a computer-driven filmmaking technique called motion capture that is
widely used in video game design only recently has it had much impact on television and feature animation
notably in donkey kong country and a new version of superman that is available on the internet and will be coming
to television at issue is what constitutes animation a question that may seem unimportant to most viewers
but is a big deal in the industry as reflected in the controversy over donkey kong country's emmy
eligibility something to keep in the back of your head as we talk about this because there is something
here that's interesting about that yes this is using a specific technical tool yeah to a specific creative
end poorly and but there is still creativity behind it yes which is what i found most shocking about
this show it's it's like the super mario brothers movie this is a really fascinating thing because of
the ways that it is bad uh the original donkey kong cartoon from the supercade is way worse than this
oh really it's not fun to watch because it's again just the dregs of somebody in a cubicle doing their
hannah barbara type animation over and over and over and over again but like this is people working
with new stuff having no idea what to do with it and making something that you can't peel your eyes
away from unbelievably strange good banana pun there hey hey well you know how much i love bananas being
mickey mouse you know that yeah here's what i will say though one of the things that is pretty dialed in
about this show uh is the music uh just just for note it was composed by a company called the pure
west music which of course was also canadian later became pure flicks that is not true but what is
true is that they did the uh theme song for zabuma foo oh i never watched zabuma foo okay i think it was a
little bit past my age bracket you of course had younger siblings yeah yeah i watched the predecessor
kratz creatures right which apparently was quite the gay awakening for a lot of other people in my
cohort not for me i wasn't gay until i was 17 like the krat brothers were yeah huh do you remember the
exact moment you were gay no i think it happened a little gradually sure and then stopped halfway as for
me when i was in the third grade i thought that i was gay uh because i could draw my uncle was and i
kept my room straight i told my mom tears rushing down my face she's like uh josh you've loved girls
since before pre-k so that that was my uh story that was great i can't change even if i tried even if i
wanted to i have no idea what this bit is oh what is this well aj why don't you come with me and josh
because we're gonna go pop some tags oh you got twenty dollars in your pocket okay and that's from
thrift that's right no it's from same love no i'm gonna say no it is actually from
well i called it thrift stores so really that's my uh that's my operating knowledge that's that's the
macklemore jukebox musical thrift store anyway i'm looking at some shopping why don't we just go ahead
and roll that uh roll that beautiful theme song yeah because this really is okay sing along if you
know it yeah there's a fine line you have to draw between what you hear and what you see yes because
in this show there are two very different things they're two completely different experiences if
you close your eyes and i tried this while just listening to this episode yeah what you hear is a
pretty normal kids show yes right there's bits there's japes you hear like wacky foley here there
you hear some goofy voices some goofy voices some kick-ass songs yeah and then you open your eyes
nightmare like i'm wondering were these live puppeteered as well the pupil sizes that's a great
question you see the pupils do it's horrible it's like they're they're not attached to the eye
it's like they're their own separate they grow the eyes are like morphing and changing it's like
every three seconds they witness god in real time that's right one of the other things too about like
this specific intro is that it's all quick cuts right it is yeah moments from the show it's all
the best moments the best moments including of course the famous famous moment uh that has been
memed many times now where donkey kong is sitting on a dock uh we just sort of see his big cheeked up
ass yeah he raises his finger to let you know that you can touch it once and see that's that's a really
funny little bit of animation him holding up it is his finger it's like that that actually like
reaches you in some way well i know why his ass looked like that if that's information you want
to know or if you want to keep living in ignorance i'd like to know okay it was just because uh they had to
make all of his body parts very geometrically simple oh because that was the only way they
could actually make this animation work in any real way so especially in these early episodes
everyone is just triangles squares and circles all the way down there's so much prominent ass cheek and
just uh groin so much groin you you have to face it so much in this show it also took us like a
like down shot of taint like underneath the butt yeah yeah i was trying to include that in general
groin area mostly because i didn't want you to go on another taint bit no i'm not i'm not going to
go on a taint bit other than to say that you don't none of these characters have taints in this in this
show like yes they do no but they don't they're not like flopping down in the front of the camera
because they don't do that aj not even yours i've had a good look you have had a good look that's fair
um but yes then did you have a good look i i that's unimportant i don't need to i i feel like we
should uh resolve this off mic if possible uh but but i appreciate us like in the new year right i
appreciate that we are here having the conversations that need to be had yeah yeah it's an election year
boys god well the whole year is the arguing season this the first episode that we covered for uh this
particular episode of the worst of all possible worlds is bad hair day which is episode one it's
the pilot baby and this episode begins with cranky kong who we will remember of course is the
original the original dk he's the guy on top of that that tower and he's playing an organ and
singing some people call me they don't like my frown they all try to cheer me up but i'm down with
being down i know what you're thinking he's a genius cause i am it's not what i was thinking
cranky i got my finger on for me yeah cranky the oldest wisest ape you'll ever meet for example
you come to see the most highest possession on the entire island who do you come to see me you
okay give your eyeballs a swing over there it's a magical it's mysterious
it's the eight and a half wonder of the world okay the crystal coconut
see that just sounds like a kid show to me it sounds like a bad kids show
yeah an annoying kids show yeah uh like this uh it's like here's the thing that we have here's a
guy singing the blues right while playing the blues organ except that the organ then just ends up playing
itself yeah uh yeah he has to keep narrating what the crystal coconut is but he doesn't actually
explain anything he just explains that it is very desired that exists he also explains that donkey kong
is royalty yes he is the heir apparent to a throne he's not the king yet but he will be he'll inherit
it from his arch rival king k rule right who is referred to as k rule once and then they just call
him k rule but then that ruins the whole joke that's the joke it's k initial right rule because
it's he's he's cruel but it's k rule you have to put that together in your own head they can't have
everyone just saying just calling him cruel the whole time but that's what they do that's what they do
they do they call him k rule and wouldn't cranky kong technically be the king because he was the
original donkey kong is going to be king then how did he inherit this do i i don't did he pull his
necktie from a stone i do also it was really stuck in there this is this is obviously not anything that
they ever talk about but where's mario in all this oh yeah no i mean i mean mario doesn't really i mean
in terms of like donkey kong 64 like he doesn't play a part in like rares sort of vision of donkey kong
true based on rare true i mean he dk is obviously in the new super mario brothers movie because they
wanted to incorporate sort of a larger mythos into like the mushroom kingdom right donkey kong is part
of the mushroom kingdom and doug young has been in all the racing games he's been in mario kart 64
like he did but yeah no the world all the competitive stuff the world of this donkey kong is sort of
parallel to the mushroom kingdom yeah yeah in the way that rares i would argue is also parallel so i mean
i think if you if you apply like the plot of king kong to it mario got on a boat and he went to
the island of what is it called again uh congo bongo congo congo congo congo the island of congo
bongo yes the island kingdom and he was doing colonialism and decided to take the ape to new
york and then you know shenanigans happened with his girlfriend pauline and he had to rescue her and
then donkey kong of course was then going to be sent to a zoo but then his son donkey kong jr who is the
current donkey kong yes the one who will be king avenged his father avenged his father brought him
back to the island right right and so then there was a b thing somewhere in the middle there you
know we all have those phases we all have sondheim certainly had a huge b phase yeah he wrote the b
movie he did well he wrote he wrote what's the buzz two movies the last of sheila and the b movie well
it's based on a story by sondheim because sondheim wrote a musical called what's the buzz which then
jerry seinfeld stole in order to make his b movie this is all false listener no what no it's real
it's real it's real and true mickey mouse you liar you cheat you scoundrel so i want to pull it back
to the crystal coconut here yes the crystal coconut is the macguffin of the show every episode involves
having to carul wanting to get every episode episode carul wants to get the crystal coconut and
he gets foiled by donkey kong yes that's the show that's the whole show the added complication that
happens in the second half is that all the bananas are threatened yes so donkey kong wants two things
he wants to fuck this one chick he wants to make sure the bananas are protected yes and every time he he
he goes off of the the straight and narrow that always threatens the bananas or his fucking right
possibility the the last piece too that i wanted to note about the crystal coconut specifically for
the lore heads right the people who played donkey kong 64 and are like wait a minute the crystal
coconut is actually a rather common collectible in donkey kong 64 i remember this that's true this is a
difference in the show and you're just gonna have to get used to that the rabid donkey kong 64 fan base
are going to burn us to the ground josh it's not my fault i'm just communicating what's in the show
i mean we can't pretend they don't exist i'm observing the rabid max payne fan base so king k rule right
yeah king k rule he's our antagonist yeah he's you know he's a gator he's he's gay uh he's a gay
oh i would argue okay uh just because he's british no because he sounds like this hey karua what's up
donkey kong did he um it was a good match you won i lost good sportsmanship and all that
i'm just an underprivileged reptile let's blame it on my genes we're uh
i think that his character models and all the character models of the bad guys are the most
successful because they're scales and not fur yeah right the fur looks like garbage it looks like it
i mean diddy looks like he's made of sheet rock like it is it is deeply unsettling to behold in
motion candy looks like a burn victim that was just the other piece about that too in that specific clip
i was like wait why is there a line that's like i'm poor and underprivileged blame it on my jeans
that's such a weird like late 90s clintonite like we're out here doing the damn thing right yeah that's
interesting and it also to me is interesting because i found something that was a comment
that was left by one of the creators of this show on a website that is now completely defunct oh and uh
it is still up there it's on the archive and again we will link it in the notes media lab owned the
property optioned from nintendo and had 13 episodes written that were horrendous with racist slash sexist
jokes and just so bad for a kiddie show they fired the original writers and asked nelvana to repair
what had been done since almost 10 storyboards were already conceived from the 10 horrible scripts
nelvana was forced to use them to save some money so new stories were written based around the drawing
slash storyboards birds storyboards and so something it makes me wonder like were there other
little bits and pieces here that just kind of stayed in or like it was like a toning down of the original
joke right something that's possible it's sort of like yeah if you watch the pokemon the the the
first movie mewtwo strikes back yes however many colons you need to put in there uh all of them it's it's
the script is just totally different right like you get to the last half right and the the american version
of the movie has this like pacifist message whereas the japanese movie is like weirdly eugenicist
oh yeah a hundred percent yeah no a clone can never be the the same as the real thing we must go and live
somewhere else forever uh yeah it's it's very depressing and and the infamous line from pokemon
from that movie is pokemon weren't meant to fight not like this and that is nowhere in the japanese
version nurse choice is like yeah look at beating the shit out of each other let's fucking go yeah
there's no like we're all under the same sky and all of that shit none of it none of it it's just
like mouth going i just realized some beings are genetically inferior like also but wait josh
are you telling me that the french can be racist uh yes uh surprise yeah that's that's pretty amazing
because i mean this show every single scene just feels like it's filling out time yes exactly it's
just running it's way to the end i just like the old pac-man cartoons it's just like bad guy does this
we go back to the good guys donkey kong is a dingus he messes up something at the factory
yeah the barrel factory we'll get to the barrel factory with one employee and one boss and like
it's just it just does that every the bananas get threatened etc and in this episode the arc is that
uh karul has discovered that you you can thank you uh k-rule i'll kill rule they call it karul
i know they do they're wrong they're just wrong he has found out that donkey kong's strength yes can
be removed if you cut his hair much like samson in the bible yeah here's my question for you both
how did you define this as a bible as a biblical adaptation uh great i loved it yeah uh i felt like
i was having an adventure in odyssey that's what i'm saying pointed me to the lord's truth no yeah well
and it's weirder than that even it's not that him getting his hair cut affects the power that he has
no and now understanding that they had to like just use like existing setups and make a new script
right uh king k rule pulls out uh his book of voodoo yes magic tricks yes right next to his book of voodoo
economics hey and uh boy one of them really is 1998 isn't it let's go one of them is just this yeah
clip his hair while saying a magic phrase yeah yeah there's a clipping phrase yeah that will take his
powers away right so he's like who could i get close enough to donkey kong to cut his hair
ah yes the lady donkey kong right yes candy kong but i can't convince her to do it obviously
so i'll just make a robot a fembot yeah of candy kong like in metropolis yes and then
he already has it mostly made he just has to screw the head on yeah or it just happens really quick
and then they have to like they finish developing yeah what's interesting here too though is that uh
diddy kong who of course is donkey kong's little buddy yes he has a very strict like bros before
hose mentality here yeah looking fine dk what's up i've gotta look good you do but i gotta look
especially smooth yeah that's how donkey kong sounds sorry it's a perfect choice candy candy she's just
a girl dk you can't have fun with a girl like we do you're goddamn right oh oh no
oh oh dear diddy kong is supposed to sort of be the brains of the operation the brains of dk's
brawn and that's usually how he's portrayed in pretty much every version of donkey kong he's like
an inventor he makes jet packs and shit he shoots banana guns you know at one point no no his coconut
coconut bun can fire and spurts if it hits shoots you you're gonna it's gonna hurt the fuck aj i'm
sorry i've forgotten my i you forgot the scriptures i'm gonna go home and say three dk raps and then
that will absolve me of my sins and this one he's just kind of like a little brother he's like a
petulant little brother also perhaps lover it's it's very very unclear it's very so this is a question
for both yeah do you think that the gayness of this was in any way shape or form an intentional
choice or illusion no because you have to remember it's french they're just kind of accidentally gay
all the time well there is a thing where it's like this was also just a very common trope that
you know homosexuality was used as a punchline a lot in the 90s obviously right but also that in
kid shows these very flamboyant characters were gay coded but to the kids watching they would never
they never thought that the kids watching would be like oh that's a homosexual well do we think
that's a funny guy do we think diddy is gay coded is basically my question i don't think so because
there are so many other characters on this show that are so much more blatantly gay coded i think
this was a very unfortunate writing mistake fair play one of the characters who is definitely gay
coded uh is bluster kong john waters kong yes john waters kong uh but he's so straight again the french
don't understand how gay they are sometimes yeah he's aggressively straight this is the next character
who we meet here though because bluster uh well he he controls the means of production of barrels yes
and his whole thing his all he does at the barrel factory is sexually harass candy kong who is donkey
kong's girlfriend and that's it she's his one employee hey candy surprise a birthday cake how original
yes i am a thoughtful son of a gun son of a gun oh banana cream your favorite rejected get him my
figure now don't bother i'm watching it for you oh god oh it's so awful that line would work on me
and it really cannot be emphasized enough how much more upsetting this is with the facial animations
that are going on they made this guy look i mean they wanted him to look like a creep but he's like
really a creep yeah he's got like the center part uh but also like it's thinning the pencil mustache
he has attempted a clark gable mustache that turns out more john waters candy
i can't help but notice your figure he's a little cookie monster actually
candy monster okay so yes yes i think that bluster is a nightmare to look at yes but we have to spend a
little more time on candy kong certainly her design is horrific and in a way that like in the rare games
candy kong obviously has has you know clothes has i mean all of these characters could just be improved
by having some clothes she does have some clothes yeah she she she has less than she does in the
games but she has more than most of the gorillas around and like kind of a t-shirt situation she's so
hot she's so sexy with her boobs i can't i can't help but think that this had to have been a sexual
awakening for somebody that candy had to be that sort of gateway in the way that lola bunny then
afterwards was also one of those but who is this person and if you're listening to this
podcast shout it out in the comments because i i need to know i don't need to know this worked
i'd rather not know who was turned on by candy who had their sexual awakening by watching candy kong
in the donkey kong country animated series yes yes i need i need to know if this worked on anyone
because it's such a nightmarish design and i will admit my earlier thing where i said she looked like a
burn victim i did steal that from erica aka canut girl 1966 who worked on the show and she said and i
quote i really hated candy just looking at her weird design made me cringe she looked like a burn
victim and she does yeah the skin texture is just strange it's so much like redder than her face
which is more pink right right and well and she also has the most human looking face yes of all the
they want her to be sexy which she is she is oh fuck she's just sexually josh present are you one of
those people aj aj aj i don't want to talk about this okay okay no we'll move on we'll move on
it's okay i i had a sexual awakening about king karul if it helps uh so
but yes we we had previously mentioned that karul's big plan uh to cut donkey kong's hair is to create
a fembot of candy and once karul completes the candy fembot well she starts singing
i'm candy kong's hair but honey i'm the ordinary day
i'm sugary sweet just like candy king
Oh
Ghosts
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
This show is a musical
Yeah
Yeah
Like cop rock
It is
There are at least two original musical numbers in every episode of this show
Every single one
And apparently this was a studio note where they were like we gotta have songs
Yeah
This is not a normal thing for a TV show
Oh
No
Like I mean for a kid show occasionally
Occasionally
I was thinking about like a live action thing like Adventures in Wonderland for example
Which was a like the hundred episode Alice in Wonderland thing
Yeah that certainly had
That musical numbers
I will remember couch potato from that for the rest of my life
Yeah I mean a lot of times it's like yeah for like little children's TV
Yeah
You know Sesame Street and whatever
Yeah
But like
Yeah this is targeting like six to twelve year olds
Yeah
Like Dexter's Laboratory was not a musical
Right
You know Powerpuff Girls
They had a musical episode of Dexter's Lab I think
Yes but were there two original musical numbers in every episode
No no no no
Every single episode having songs that are not good
You see when they got Paul Williams on Dexter's Laboratory
That song was good
Brian you're saying that none of these songs are good?
Correct
Wow
And I should know
Wow
Man
I have had quite a long career
Of putting out hit songs
You sure have
As Mickey Mouse
Yes
Who I am
So to me the musical numbers are what make this show more than just a strange little piece
of pop culture ephemera
Yeah
It is so weird
Well that's yeah that's part of it
Like it wouldn't be fascinating if the songs were good
Except that they are
Except not
I will say I'm in the middle ground
I'm in the middle between you two
Okay
I think that some of the songs are actually very good and catchy
I think others are deeply deeply terrible
The one we just listened to is awful
Oh no it's bad
It's bad
That one was doing no one any favors
Well I did like the backup singers
I will
I do like the army of ghosts
Not the last ghosts we'll see
No
No
Certainly not
Look examining this from like a musical perspective
Yeah
Right musical numbers should
Not always but you know
Should often move the plot forward in some way
Right
And in that respect I think most of the songs
In this show
Are successful
So
I'm so sorry Brian
Oh his ears are flaring
His giant black ears
So
This show was on in the middle of the day on TV
Usually if you're a kid
You're watching TV
You don't have a lot of options right
Most of the programming is going to be for the elderly
Right
Correct
So everyone you know
You hope that Cartoon Network's got a good one
But if it doesn't you got to go to another channel
Maybe the price is right is on if you're lucky
Yeah
Donkey Kong Country was a last resort TV program
Okay
Sure
And anytime a song started
I just thought
Why am I still on this channel
There has to be something
There has to be a rerun of Matlock
That would be better than this
So you have like a core memory of being like
If I hear one more of these fucking songs
I just remember thinking
This is boring as fuck
These songs are bad
And like you're talking about moving the plot forward
What plot
There's a coconut
Coconut's gone
The bananas are threatened
Donkey Kong
It resolves itself
No but it's their inner emotions
There's another thing where Donkey Kong like pisses off half of the cast every episode
And then by the end they're like
It's fine
Yeah
Yeah
We've found it in our hearts to forgive you Donkey Kong
Yeah
But it lets you know what Donkey Kong's feeling
Like that he's really sad sometimes
He's really sad much of the time
And we get inside Candy's head
Like she thinks she's hot
What's in her head
What's in Candy's head
She thinks she's hot
That's uh huh
Uh huh
Something that you just said
In four words
But that's the thing
Is that
I have much
I have a much better tolerance for this stuff
Because I am an unfortunate defender of cats
Uh
It is a thing of
There is value
I think in having characters come out
And singing at you
What their thing is
Yeah
If the song
Doesn't
Fucking
Suck
And I'm not defending this song in particular
Because I don't particularly think this is a good song
But a lot of the songs in this show
Are just people explaining to you who they are
And I'm like I'm on board for this
It's true
Uh
Yeah
I did not hate this show
Josh before you ask
Yes
Like
Like how mad are you at me this week
Yeah
And I'm like not really
Because I had a pretty good time
Okay
You had a better time than I did
Yeah I think so
I think it's a
Brian's just shaking his head right now
I'm responsible for this episode happening
I made a decision
So many years ago
In between Josh showing me videos of like
Homemade fleshlights
And fembots
That sing their own songs
Where I was like
Oh yeah
Well here's another piece of uncanny things
Here's a full fledged TV series
About Donkey Kong
Where every episode has a musical number
You know what
It's like my dream come true
Like a good version of the show
It's like a monkey's paw situation
It really is
Like
Cause he's a monkey
He's a gorilla
He's an ape
It's a type of monkey
You know what Brian
I feel fantastic
Hey hey hey
And one of the reasons that I feel so fantastic
Yes
Is that
After
Candy has her wonderful little introduction
She goes and
Is Delilah
Yeah
No this is the plot of Metropolis
Yeah
She goes and does Temptation
And
And is Delilah
And plays all those wonderful
Peebo Bryson songs
For us on the radio
You don't know your own strength
Donkey Kong
We'll have to fix that
Slip
Slip
Power slip
You're a wimp
And that's it
That's the voodoo curse
Slip
Snip
Gonna clip
Make you my sweet and sexy chimp
Come here you hunk of love
Okay then
Chop chop
Sheesh
What a goon
Oh
I can't watch this
He's gooning alright
All done
That wasn't so bad
Was it?
Do you like it?
Smooth
Too smooth
Oh no
Geek alert
In case you forgot it was the 90s
It should be noted here
Yes yes
Please note this
When Donkey Kong has his hair cut off
Uh huh
You might think that you know that big like cow lick
Uh huh
Goes away
It doesn't
It turns out that's like a horn
He has two
That's just his skin
It's his skin
He has two skins
It's like a flesh horn that's on top of his head
We have another word for flesh horns
Uh Josh
And I believe that word is he has two dicks on his head
Just two floppy ass cow lick dicks
It's not good
It's so
Cow dicks
Cow dicks
It's so unnerving to witness in real time
Um
I also
Very
Interesting to have the word sexy in a kid show
Yes
Yes
It's not uncommon
That's a thing that like every time I see it
I'm a little bit taken aback by it
But this was very common on Nickelodeon shows
Sexy was not a
In my house it was considered not a dirty word
But it had like sort of the vague aura of dirtiness around it
Yeah I feel like in the 90s it was generally like
I think I think sexy now has like
Diluted so much that you don't even think of sex when you say sexy
But in the 90s you certainly did
But that's because Justin Timberlake brought it back
Yeah
That's true
That's true
Yeah
And
You know what actually you know what
You motherfuckers watch how I attack
You know what sexy back is actually missing
It's just a guy in the background going
Good idea
He gets
He gets cocked basically
Donkey Kong is weak now
He's weak
And she's strong
This doesn't really matter
But it is kind of a good gag
That like because she's a robot version of Candy
She's really strong
They're also trying to telegraph
Every time it's robot Candy
Because when she walks
You could hear that metallic sound
Oh is that what that was
And also she's supposed to move a little weird
Right
But you can't tell
That's unreadable
You can't tell
Because they always move very very weird
They all move so so so weirdly
And one of the things then that occurs
As a result of Donkey Kong becoming weak
Is that he's not able to defend Cranky Kong's home
Oh no
When K'Rool arrives to try to steal the crystal coconut
Yeah and King K'Rool shoots a gun
That's full of tiny alligators
The tiniest alligators
The tiniest
That eat the thatched roof
Of Cranky Kong's hut
Right
Nom nom nom nom nom
It is
This is so insane
It's so weird
That I do appreciate it
They're all
Yeah
The tiny alligators are talking to each other
Yeah
Inside of the blunderbuss
They're like
Oh it's a living
Basically
Yes
It's also like
This doesn't need to be here
You're here
Why is this here
Probably because it got storyboarded out
And so it had to stay in
But like
Yeah
But they're recurring characters
Like those gun things come back
Those little blue guys
Yeah
Yeah
They're in the title sequence
For the whole rest of the show
Yeah
Like the writing behind the show
I think actually had sparks in it
Every once in a while
Yeah
Of just like
Once they kind of grappled with the insanity
That they were creating
Right
They really I think flourished in an interesting way
In terms of how they resolved this particular conundrum
You know
Donkey Kong needs to become strong again
He needs to regrow his hair
So for plot reasons
He eats a lot of bananas
Yeah
He you know
Bananas make your hair grow
Yeah
And
That's just science
We get a moment here that
I don't know
I just I just want to play this actually
Yeah
No context
Just listen to this
Look
More bananas
No help
Not another bite
It's not gonna work
You have to
Open up
What do you got to lose
Oh I don't even think about that
My lunch
One banana bowl
Right
Oh
Huh
Look at your head
Your hair is growing back
So are my muscles
I feel a certain way
About this
Go on
No please
Go on
I would rather not elaborate
Okay
I feel like our listeners would love
If you could elaborate just a little bit
Well I just
I think it's a lot of personal thoughts
Uh huh
You know
It's a lot of things that
That don't need to be articulated
Gotcha
Okay
We can resolve this off Mike
As long as you all understand that the feeling is there
Okay
Mmhmm
I don't fully understand what actually happens
At this point
Because DK eats a shit ton of bananas
It makes his hair grow
But nothing happens
He's so strong now
No no no
But nothing happens
And then
Diddy Kong shoots
A banana
Into his mouth
Right
Yes
And that makes his hair grow
Which leads me to believe
That you have to get it straight from the source
Mmhmm
Or else it doesn't
Work
Here's the thing
He'd had so many bananas
Yeah
He didn't think
That he could have
Another banana
Okay
That's a very good point Josh
Okay
He thought he was just
Too full
Okay
But you know what
Diddy knew
Mmhmm
Diddy knew
He's just
He's a lot more powerful than that
He could have another banana
Yeah
What did I know
Just that that would not be an issue
For Donkey Kong to have another banana
Oh yeah
Right
Like you knew that
Oh no I absolutely knew that
Yeah he's just gonna get bigger
And hairier
And so will his muscles
This is the atheist's worst nightmare
This episode ends with Donkey Kong
Kicking Kurol's ass
You know
Yes
And then we have a little final scene
Where Candy walks up to him
And is like
Do you think I'm the real one
And then the robot one
Is like
Do you think I'm the real one
He's like
Well obviously
I'm just so smart
And he picks the robot
And then the real Candy gets mad
And the robot
Melts down
Explodes
And is immediately decapitated
Yeah
Yep
Great
Episode's over
That's it
That's the end of the episode
There's a bunch of French names
I don't remember what Donkey Kong says exactly
But he's covered in soot
As he often is
At the end of these episodes
And looks at the camera
It's something like
It's a living
You know like something
And then it's just rolled a credits
That's it
It's really surreal
What a pilot
What have we learned
What have we learned
We've learned that we just gotta keep going
We gotta
Yeah we do
We gotta
And so we got plenty more just like this
Coming up
The insanity shall continue
And we'll get to that
Right after this
Oh hello
Worst of all possible worlds listeners
Bluster Kong here
Co-owner and operator of Barrelworks
Congo Bongo's biggest and seemingly only corporation
Listeners
Do you long to get away?
Escape the doldrums of everyday life
And fly your way to paradise?
Do you like barrels and wish you had more of them?
Then discover what wonders await you
In the beautiful island nation of Kongo Bongo
Located between New Peel Land
And the newly formed Republic of Papua Chimpanzee
Kongo Bongo is the ultimate destination
For those seeking a tropical paradise
Ruled by a horrific crocodile monarchy
That will one day be usurped because of a crystal coconut or something
Listeners
Are you dying to get away from the bustling crowds of the city?
Well Kongo Bongo as you've covered
As our entire nation consists of maybe eight people
Who are all constantly trying to kill each other
Once you've seen our majestic fully rendered 3D paradise
You'll only be left with one banana slammer of a question
Why aren't I in any other Donkey Kong property?
No really?
Why?
Is it because of the mustache?
It's because of the mustache, isn't it?
Is it because I'm close with my mother?
Well she's a wonderful barrel mogul
What has your mother ever done?
You don't know what it's like
To be stuck here in Kongo Bongo
While everyone else has moved on to other games
Other properties
Their souls transferred to sleeker, shinier bodies
Leaving their old ones behind
Like ancient husks of long-forgotten beasts
Candy remains frozen on the line
Still sorting through barrels
Her eyes vacant and unseeing
Mother says all this will pass
And frankly I don't know what I would do without her
Even though she hasn't called in a while
And I can't
I can't seem to remember her face
Did I ever know what it looked like?
Mama Kong you hear me
Mama Kong you see me
It's your dear sweet boy bluster
I did everything you said mother
I built the factory
I was mean
To Donkey Kong
I played my part
What did I do wrong?
What did I do wrong mama?
What did I do wrong?
So come visit the only island nation
Populated almost exclusively by yeti ghosts
Kongo Bongo
Kongo Bongoing
Kongo Bongoing
Kongo Bongoing
Kongo Bongoing
Like
We are one of the most tightly wound podcasts
I think
In general
Like we
Are you rolling now as you're saying this?
I don't know what you're talking about
Oh you sneaky son of a bitch
As I was saying about our show
You sneaky little rat
Which is so
Sorry mouse
It's so good
We're so good at podcasting
And I think that
No we're good
But we
Like
That's not a positive or negative
It's just like the
The mode
The format of stuff that we do
We're tightly wound
That's true
We are a little
Spring box
You're not wrong
Terror
That we unleash upon the rest of the world
Yeah
Sometimes in the form of monkeys
We're more fun than a barrel of one of those
Well speaking of barrel
Who's
Who's got
Who's got barrel
Who?
Barrel barrel
Who's got barrel
That's the name of this episode
Oh it's everywhere
Everyone got barrel
Barrel barrel
Who's got the barrel
Opens with Donkey Kong
Letting us know that he has a bad case of the ugly
Me too buddy
Which yeah
Yeah we're back on haircuts
What do you want Bluster?
I've been looking all over for you
I'm the boss
And the boss says
Lunch is up
Back to work
Unless
You want to play hooky with me
Two tickets
The banana slammers
You and me Candy
Forget it
What are the bananas
I'm finishing my lunch with
He has tickets to something?
Five people live on this island
It's not so much a nation
It's a bunch of friends
Well
Yes
Yes
He's a big hairy ape
And you're not
Ouch
So Bluster
Has had his
Toxic masculinity
Throne
So by episode four
Candy is
Is dating
Sucking
And or fucking
Donkey
Oh all the above
It's a pretty quick escalation
You know
It was a real gamble for them
Because you know
Yeah it's not a will they won't they
It's a will they
Yes
But Candy must give extraordinary head
With that mouth
What that fucking mouth do though
Oh boy
Oh no
Oh no
I would think donkey
Would actually give better head
Because he has a longer
Longer mouth
To work with
Well they both have a longer mouth
To work with
No but donkeys is longer
They're apes
Don't apes have incredibly long tongues
For like eating ants
Or am I thinking of an ape?
I think you're thinking of ant eaters
I think it was watching
I think it was watching me in real time
Realize my mistake
You were just
You got lost in the A's
Of animals
I always get lost in the A's
Of animals baby
There's apes
And there's ant eaters
I always get them mixed up
Bluster gets a big hair piece
Put on his head
A pompadour
It's large
It's strange
Right
Yeah he's got a pompadour
That's sort of like
You know the Grinch's dog
Yeah
Where's that
The one antler
Yeah yeah
It's like that
It is like that
Crystal coconut
More like crystal cucka nut
Yeah
Yeah
Cause Malvolio here
Tries to steal
Yeah
The coconut
Yeah
Instead of K. Rool
We're mixing it up
A little bit today
Why not
It's the MacGuffin
So somebody's gotta steal it
In episode 4
We've already run out of ideas
We don't know what the coconut does still
But it's important
But we know that somebody's gotta have it
So let's have a listen
Donkey Kong
Donkey Kong
Big deal
What makes him so special
The crystal coconut
Oh hell yeah
Oh right
He has a song
Yeah he does
Here I go creeping
Shh
Don't make a sound
Get the crystal coconut
And candy
Come around
Donkey Kong
Eat good enough
Anyone can see
That the only ape for her
And Kongo Pongo
Is me
Look at Frankie
Sleeping
Hour after hour
When I get the coconut
I get the power
Everything I want
And everything I need
If I know
I can run to me
Satisfied
Three
Cranky's asleep
Bad song
I'm so
I don't know what you're talking about
I don't know
I don't know
Brian
I kinda dig that song
I think it's so weird
And so creepy
I'm watching Cranky sleep
I'm sleeping
I'm so soundly
And here's the thing about Candy
Is that her character trait
Is that
Because she's a broad
Right
She just loves getting gifts
Of jewelry
Yes
Gold and diamonds
Yeah keep in mind
The first ten episodes of this
Were already pre-written
And storyboarded in France
So three
Of the four episodes
That we are covering today
All take place
Within the frantic
Rewriting zone
So if things seem
Overly sexual
And racist
In these episodes
This is in the liminal space
Between the Canadian imagination
And the French mind
But yes
DK
Actually has a premonition
So he heads off
To Cranky's
And yeah
Lo and behold
The coconut's gone
The barrel
There's a barrel
That gets the coconut
And the barrel
Gets sent up into space
Because it's back
At the barrel factory
And so it ends up
In a barrel
And that's barrel seven
Or barrel 007
It's barrel 007
And very briefly here
You sure do
You sure do
Because it's Funky Kong's
Barrel
And of course Funky Kong
Would have a 007 barrel
Because
He's just so funky
He is funky
So funky
He's funky
Too funky
So Funky Kong
Too furious
Is the aviator character
And in the Donkey Kong
Country games
Basically you can use
Funky's plane
At Funky's flights
To go between
Different parts
Of the world
Yeah
In this game
He's
Caribbean question mark
It kind of loosely
Yeah
He starts off
Sounding vaguely
Like Hermes
From Futurama
Yeah
But then
Drifts more
As we listen to the
Episode
Oh man
What a coup
That would have been
If they could have
Gotten Phil Lamar
Oh my god
He would have
Really elevated
The show
I think
Funky's another one
Where he just needs
Like
He has an article
Of clothing
In other places
Right
But here he's just
Nude from the neck down
Well and another issue
With Funky
As rendered
In this show
Is that he's wearing
Sunglasses
But because of
The nature
Of the rig
They are animated
Like eyes
Yeah
They squish
And they
Move around
Like a Spiderman mask
Right
The eyes articulate
Even though they're not
Real eyes
They're not eyes
They're sunglasses
Yeah
They should be more
Like a green goblin mask
Where the eyes retract
So that you can see
Willem Dafoe's eyes
Perfect
Perfect
Funky has now
Gotten involved
With his plane
We learned that
He was flying the
Barrel around
On his plane
For play
Again like
It was a delivery
It was a delivery
That was made to him
That was falsely made
None of this makes sense
I really couldn't
Follow this one
No
Yeah
There's a
Is this the one
With the satellite
Yeah
Yeah yeah
King K. Rool
King K. Rool
He needs the coconut
He's putting barrels
Together
Right
In something that looks
Like a mine
Like one that you
Put out at sea
Yes
But it's not a
It's not a bomb
After all
It's a satellite
It's a satellite
Made of barrels
And if the satellite
Goes up into the sky
Right
The bananas are gone
Right
That's right
That's how it works
I'm not making a joke
No I know
That is what it said
And it's also so weird
That he needs the crystal coconut
To make the satellite launch
Correct
But he desperately needs
The crystal coconut
To rule
Right
And keep his kingdom
Over Congo Bongo
Maybe that's what it always meant
Maybe that's what ruling is
Is having a satellite
Is sending up a satellite
The barrel dropped out of the plane
And we need this barrel
Because the barrel has the crystal coconut in it
Yeah
But bad news guys
Yeah
Bad news
There's a yeti
On the mountain
There sure is
And he's got the coconut now
His name is
Eddie
Heavy stick
Good grip
For Eddie
Too small
Hey friend
You found our barrel
Mr.
Uh
Mr.
Eddie
Eddie
Oh no
As in
The mean old yeti
Oh
Um
Mr. meanie
I mean
Eddie
Sir yeti
That's our barrel
We'll just take it
And be on our way
Okay
No
Eddie
Get bumped on head
By raining barrel
It's mine
You can keep the barrel
We just need what's inside
It's mine
All mine
Eddie the mean old yeti
Is just the same character model
As Donkey Kong
But palette swapped
Yeah
But he's white
Yeah
And he has a little hat
He's white Donkey Kong
That's right
He's got a little hat
And he's got like blue eyes
Yes
The voice actor for Eddie the yeti
Refers to himself as Eddie the yeti
Mm
He spoils it
He kills the rhyme
Oh
It's supposed to be yeti
Yeah
Eddie the yeti
Eddie the yeti
Eddie the yeti
Not Eddie the yeti
You gotta do a soft T there
Yeah
Let's just say he's being painted
With a particularly broad brush stroke
I'm sure you heard it itself
And I don't care for it
Very much
It's got the of mice and men thing
A little bit
A little bit
A little bit
It's used to much better effect
I think in the second episode
Spoilers
Eddie's coming back
We're gonna have more of him
In a big way
Apparently
Hope you like him
There's some mythology
I don't remember
If
Don't look at me Brian
I have no fucking idea
You made this happen
Yeah
I didn't know if you watched
Every episode or not
He learned it from you Brian
What watch all the 40
Are you fucking kidding me
Josh
No way
I know
I might go back
I know who we are
I know who this podcast is
Good point
You know
You're Josh Borman
He's AJ Diddy
I'm Mickey Mouse
Yeah
Sometimes we did
We did that
We watched
Every episode of Studio 60
When we were not asked to
That's right
It was not fun
And it wasn't even good bad
Like this is
I had fun
I had fun
Yes well that's because
You were like
Oh it's just like
I'm hanging out with
Uncle Aaron again
It is
It is
Don't take that from me
It was the one cool thing
I've ever done
I'm sorry AJ
It's just that
I've never done a cool thing
DK and Diddy then
Come up with an idea
Which is to
Wrap their way
To a deal
Say
Eddie
How about a deal
Fire for the barrel
It's a bargain
It's a steal
Steal
No but here's the catch
Give us the barrel
And we'll give you a match
They're striking matches
On there
He has a match
That was stored in his ass
Or something
Will the barrel keep you warm
On a cold winter's night
Night
Right
There's more you can do
Like cooked banana burgers
On the barbecue
Barbecue
And firecrackers too
Can a barrel
Let the sky
Like fireworks do
So have we got a deal
Have we got a deal
Eddie
Eddie have we got a deal
So have we got a deal
Have we got a deal
Eddie
Eddie have we got a deal
How do I get this thing to light
Gotta move it
Gotta shake it
Gotta scratch it
Just right
So most of these songs
Were composed by a couple
Of composers
Right
This one
They were like
Well we don't know
How to do rap
We gotta make sure
That the rap
Is done right
For this scene
So they hired a consultant
On how to write a rap
And it was actually
Broadway's own
Stephen Sondheim
Oh okay
It was right
The whole time
I was like
A bear
Bears are sweet
Besides you ever seen
A bear with 40 foot feet
And I'm like
Jesus
He tried
He did try
You know what it actually
Reminded me of
Was that
Adventures in Odyssey
Communicate rap
It does
It does
It's not quite as bad
As that
No it's not
No offense to Will Ryan
Who did write that song
Oh no
He was a talented songwriter
But again
Some people
Just shouldn't go
Towards rap
Ever
No and that's
And that's fine
I mean I also got vibes
At the end of this
Of you gotta know
The territory
Yes
Yeah
Also
The way
There was something
About the way
At the end
That DK and Diddy
Were like
Kind of like
Holding out their matches
And pointing
That felt very
Regular show to me
Oh sure
Yeah
Regular show
Would just like
Have a scene
Where they're
Negotiating with someone
And then just
Introduce that
One of them
Has a match
And also
The logic of
A match
Being something
That could be
Readily exchanged
Feels very
Regular show to me
As it stands here
Though because
The match
To be exchanged
For goods and services
Right
The baseline rules
Of this world
Are so confusing
That it just feels
Like a mistake
Whereas if it were
Something more like
Regular show
Where your baseline
Rules are clear
And this is an addition
That's fun
I don't know
It is funny though
It's just
It's interesting you say that
Because I actually think
That the show plays
Pretty fast and loose
With it's rules
Like I don't think
It's like
It really abides by
Yeah
That's what I'm saying
It doesn't have fun
With like cartoon logic
Right
Like in kind of a normal
Sometimes you get something
That's absolutely cracked
Like the tiny alligators
That live in a blunderbuss
Right
Yeah
And eat
Roofing
And care
As we've seen this
That's right
But then
Just a lot of the time
It's just like
Here's another fucking thing
With the coconut
Or a banana
Right
Here's a match
Fuck it
Who cares
I have to go home
I need to go home
To see my wife
My gorilla wife
So there's like
In these first ten episodes
Again
It really
It does feel like
They're really trying
Experimenting things out
We did watch an episode
That was later in the run
That I do feel like
Like it made itself
More available to
Cartoon logic
Yes
And was thus
Much more entertaining
Yeah
Than these first three combined
But we're still stuck
In the Eddie the Yeti episode
Because there's gotta be
A fisticuffs at the end
We gotta have a big brouhaha
Yeah of course there does
The barrel gets
Thrown around a bunch
Between everyone
We are going to launch
The satellite
What do we do now?
If Karua launches
The coconut into orbit
It's the end of us
That's it
No more bananas
Nope
No more bananas
Yep
And no more
Bananas
Bananas
Oh my god
Oh my god
Okay
That's good
That's actually
That's pretty funny
That's pretty funny
It's part of this whole
We have nothing else
Happening on this show
No
This is it
They really went
It went all in on Eddie
Didn't they
As a character
Yeah
They really banked on him
Being like a catchphrase
Spouting
Yeah
Regular character
On this show
Well there is an episode
And I didn't include it
On this playlist
But there is an episode
Where he falls in love
With Candy
Eddie the Yeti
Yeah
Does he paint himself
Brown
No
What's amazing
Is like you know
You guys know me
That's actually a pretty good plot
For this show probably
You guys know me
I have a pretty weirdly good memory
Yeah
Especially talking about
Horrible shit from my childhood
See also
Adventures in Odyssey
Like one of the messages
We get from people the most
Is like I was listening to this
And I didn't remember anything
And then it all came back
And it's like
Oh no
It's been up here for me
This whole time
It's all right there
Flashes of light
And I
Just the Jim
A regular Jim Steinman
Yeah
Wow
You mean
Tanz der Vampiris
On Jim Steinman
You wrote a German musical
And it's very bad
Thank you
There it is
There's that brain
Based on a Roman Polanski movie
That Germans
Think is such a classic
And Americans
Have never heard of
Roman Polanski
Also directed that musical
On the stage
On the stage
Yeah
Oh no
Yeah
I remember so little
From this show
Even though I watched
So much of it
I remember that there
Were musical numbers
I remember Donkey Kong
Having a musical number
With like a duplicate
Donkey Kong at one point
Okay
And I remember
There's one episode
Where Funky Kong
Or maybe it's Donkey
Driving his
His plane or something
Does not know what
ASAP means
Because I as a child
At the time
Did not know what
ASAP meant to myself
And so he got all the words
Except for what the S
Stood for
So he was you know
Postulating you know
Does it mean as stupid
As possible
And then Cranky's
On the radio
Goes
As soon as possible
It's a really good Cranky
That's all I remember
From this program
Not a single song
You didn't remember a song
I remembered that
They were slow and bad
Not all of them
Not all of them
Were slow
No
Thank you for seeing
Things my way
So what a weird episode
Yeah
It ends
Normal
It ends with DK and Diddy
Punching out the bad guys
Which we don't get to see
Obviously
That doesn't get
That would be too hard
To animate
You need to get this out
In ten days
I need to see my wife
The
She has all of my cigarettes
The satellite made of barrels
Falls apart
It doesn't even launch
No
It just sort of pops
Explodes
Clump sabotaged it
Maybe
Yeah
Very unclear
And why are we letting
Any of the clumps around here
They're always causing trouble
They are
Wherever they go
That's true
That's true
But they all love each other
You know at the core of it
That's really what makes
That story work
Yeah
It's a family
So the next episode
That we watched
Is Raiders of the Lost Banana
This episode begins
Introducing us to a new character
Who is somehow
The most annoying character yet
This is a parrot
That I guess
K. Rool has hired
Recruited
Unclear
But this is
This parrot is presented
As a free agent
Yes
You guys
Do you remember his name?
I wrote it down
Hold on
It's Polly Roger
It's Polly Roger
Here's the thing
This is the episode
Where puns start coming in
I only knew
Monogamous Roger
Sure
No and that makes sense
Yeah
Brian roll that beautiful bird footage
You're forgetting yourself Polly
I'm trying to forget you
Hey
That's gross insubordination
Not as gross as you
Lizard Lardo
Lardo?
Lardo?
Let me add him
No
Why not?
Why not?
Is the key to our
Taking over Congo Bongo
What?
About time you
Wised up matey
That's of course
If I can trust you
You know
Most of these characters
Are pretty anthropomorphic
Even if they're gators
They're
They're very human
In proportion
They walk on two legs
In the way that their limbs
And their necks
Fit on their bodies
Yeah
Birds are different
Yeah birds are just birds
They're just different
And this bird is certainly mo-capped
Why does the bird have hands?
Just human hands?
The bird
The neck is always just doing crazy shit
This whole time
It's so unnerving
My first note is
I don't care for this bird
Josh's clip of this just says
A shockingly annoying parrot
Yeah
This is another person
Person
Well it's kind of a person
I mean it's kind of a person
Birds are people
It's sentient
Yeah
That he can use to his own ends
Right
Oh what are his ends
In this episode Josh?
Well it's getting
The crystal coconut
What?
Wouldn't you know
What?
The crystal coconut?
The very same
Getting stolen from Cranky Kong
Once more
And yet again
We also get
We get a sort of
Interesting little insight
Into like
The day to day uses
Of the crystal coconut
In terms of what Cranky uses it for
Yes
Because again
He keeps it in his home
I just think of him
As sort of a master Roshi figure
So he uses it to divine images
Of naked ladies
I mean he might
We don't see that
What we do see
Why do you think they call him
Cranky Kong?
Oh
Okay
Cranky uses the crystal coconut
For important things
Like figuring out
Which of these two
Identical looking elixirs
Is incredibly poisonous
But of course
The parrot comes in
Takes the crystal coconut
Fucking own
This means DK is on the case
Etc
What happens next
Was not something
I was expecting though
Yes
Which is they go down
Into this temple
Well you see
Polly Roger
When he took
The crystal coconut
He dropped it
Into the temple
Of Inka Dinkadoo
Which
Then
Donkey Kong
And Diddy Kong
Have
Some traps
That they come across
Always a good
Bit of
Potential humor
For a cartoon
There's a little
Scooby Doo
Kind of moment
Where they're
They come back
To that
Scooby Doo
Well
Between Dorian
Keystone cops
Thing a couple of times
It's never done well
As with most things
On this show
Correct
I'll agree with you
But they tried
They tried
Yeah they did try
So they
They finally get deep
Into the temple
Of Inka Dinkadoo
And they take the coconut
But then we have
Sort of an
Abu
Taking the big
Ruby emerald
But in this case
It's a golden banana
And Donkey's gonna
Donkey Kong's gonna
Get that golden banana
For a very specific purpose
He does not want
Wealth or riches
He has all that he needs
As the heir apparent
To the throne
Of Kongo Bongo
Kongo Bongo
He needs something
Special for candy
Where are we?
Look
A banana
Just what I need
I'm starving
Excuse me
You're talking
Princess
Yeah that's a direct
Reference to me
I'm hungry
Oh phooey
It's not even
A real banana
It's only gold
Gold
Gold?
Wait a second
This makes a perfect
I love that
Delivery
I love it so much
Inka
Danka
Doped
It's the sleeping
I love
Inka Dinkadoo
That golden banana
Is really important
Because bitches
Love gifts
They do
And nothing else
We are trapped
In the first ten episodes
Still
And we still abide
By the rules
That candy likes gifts
But here's the thing
You take a golden banana
From the temple
Of Inka Dinkadoo
Right
You're gonna get a curse
You're also going to get
A horror
See here
Look what you've done now
You have brought the wrath
Of Inka Dinkadoo
On down
How can such a pretty thing
As this
Make things really go on
Dinkadoo
Inka Dinkadoo
Is on a chair
That they're hoisting
About them
You're a fool
Can't you see
That there's a curse
Put the banana back
Or things are gonna
Get much worse
What's with all the worry
Can't you see
I'm in a hurry
It's a perfect gift
For our anniversary
The curse will bring
The destruction
Of the entire island
And there'll be
No bananas left
For you to eat
No bananas
It's a curse
Of the golden banana
The curse
Of the golden banana
It is at this point
That I must
Bring up the fact
That every single
One of these episodes
Even though this is
An animated television series
Was directed by
A theater director
What?
The great
Boris Tomaszewski
Pioneer of the
New York Yiddish theater
Oh okay
My god
Part of the reason
That I sort of
Pulled these clips
As long as
They are
Is that I wanted
To watch you suffer
Brian
Yeah
So yeah
Donkey Kong
Has apparently
Awakened
A Dibbuk
And
That Dibbuk
Does what?
Threatens the bananas
Yeah he sure does
As a banana loving Dibbuk
He sure does
It's a classic situation
Because this is
What's always happening
The bananas
Are under threat
What's gonna happen?
Well we gotta find out
We gotta do some research
And where do we go
To find that information?
We go
To the encyclopedia
Bananica
That made me laugh
Yeah
I liked encyclopedia
Bananica
When that stuff happens
It's good
There's not enough
Of that shit
Agreed
No no no
Not enough
Of the funny
Little banana puns
There's stuff
When you look
Actually like
On the globe
In the background
In this shot
New Zealand
Is just a banana
It's just in the shape
Of a banana
And I'm like
Yeah that's some
Fucking shit
Let's do that
That's good
There we go
We got some gags
By the way
This song happens
Before Donkey Kong
Even gets rid of the banana
Right
So he has a moment
To undo this curse
If he wishes
To have the curse reversed
He doesn't need
A certain potion first
Instead what ends up happening
Even though we've learned
Now about the curse
From the encyclopedia
Bananica
Yes
Is that Candy
He gives her
The fucking banana
Yeah
And she
Is not going to give it up
No
No
Bitches love gifts
Cursed
I'll show them cursed
Hey Candy
It's me
Your little love monkey
What happened here
Donkey Kong
Love monkey
You wouldn't believe it
There was an earthquake
That destroyed the factory
And then Bluster
Was taking me home
And his copter went kaput
And crashed into crankies
It looked insane
I wish you could have seen it
It's the golden banana
What
Don't you start telling me
It's cursed too
It is
It belongs to the big dude
In the temple of
Inka Dinkadoo
Nice try
You gave it to me
And I'm keeping it
Unless
You want to break
The whole thing off
This makes no sense
Yeah
Yeah
It can only operate
From the world view
That you think
Women are evil
Look
Boris Tomaszewski
Was a man of his time
We don't put everyone
On a pedestal
You know
That somehow absolves
Them from all of history
He had some
Antiquated ideas
Sure
He absolutely did
The thing I hate
Most about this episode
Are Donkey Kong's
Retractable teeth
Yes
Yes
The teeth come out
I guess there's just
A finger that does
Teeth
And they fucked up
And the teeth come out
The teeth come out
So much
Yeah
They're just
They're just kind of like
They pop in
And then they
Pop back out again
Yeah
I don't like the implications
Of it
I don't like the fact
That he doesn't
Have teeth in his mouth
All the time
Just sometimes
Very special occasions
You know what
Make him great at though
What
Giving head
True
True
So back at DK's place
The parrot
Anteater time
Has ended up
In his fridge
For some reason
Yeah
How did he get in there
I don't know
And I don't
Ding
But the parrot
Is like
No look
I'm not on
I'm not on
K. Rool's side anymore
I've changed
That could have been
Something you could have done
At some point in this episode
It's just like
Here's the bird again
Fuck you
You could have shown us
Maybe
Whatever
So he wants
A chance to sort of
Prove
That he's no longer
A bad guy
He gives DK the info
About the fact that
Candy
Has now been kidnapped
By K. Rool
That happened earlier
By the way
I forgot to mention
Again
He goes and saves her
Which once again
Mostly happens off camera
And then
They sing
Yes
I'm so mad
Yes
All of this forever
Is it the whole song
When I see a smile
On your hairy face
Yes
Yes
I know there's no other
Rape that could
Take your place
Yeah
I can't believe
You feel the way
That you do
Your love is like
A dream come true
Oh Josh
Yeah
Sing it man
You are the sunlight
Warming up my day
Take my hand
And everything's okay
I see bananas
When I look in your eyes
I shower you
With coconut cream pie
Yep
Yep
Yep
Yep
This is my note
Yep
You just never know
When the songs are coming
Like it's not
It's not
It's not formulaic
It's not like we're gonna have
An opening number
It's not like
Oh it's at the midpoint
Or it's like right before
We get into the third act thing
The songs are gonna be anywhere
They could be sung by anyone
At any time
It's
It's
It's not fair
You just
It's not fair
I had time now
Would it
Would it shock you to learn
That that song
Was actually in Josh's vows
It would shock me to learn that
He didn't even know what it was
I didn't introduce it to him
Until he moved to New York
It will be when he renews the vows
Yes
Yes
I think
I think
I think
This song
Everyone's gonna be like
Cream pies really
Really
Really
I think
I think
This song
Is
Is very well sung
I was very
I was actually a little surprised
Because I did not care for the other candy song
Whereas this one
I was feeling it
It's bad
I was feeling the love tonight
Let's
Let's let Brian weigh in
Okay
I'm sorry
Mickey Mouse
Yes
Yes
This song's bad
Okay
It's slow
It's too easy listening
It's too adult contemporary
This is for children
I am changing the channel
I'm gonna go back to the mash re-reaction
You didn't listen to soft rock in the car
I'm gonna do it
It's goddamn playing soft rock
Is that
Of course I did
Yeah
Every fucking time we drove back from Albuquerque
After going to the hardware store or whatever
Two hours
120 miles on that road
As the sun was setting
And Delilah would come on
And she would play
Whatever thing
Peebo Bryson was singing
Or Michael Bolton
Or Kenny G would be playing
Circular breathing
His way to hell
I just want to take a moment here
Yes
To commend Sterling Jarvis
Which is the name
Of the man
Who did Donkey Kong
Singing voice
Oh hell yeah
Sterling Jarvis
Has the voice of an angel
Sterling Harley Jarvis
He's his dad
Fuck you Sterling Jarvis
No but don't fuck you
Sterling Jarvis
I appreciate you
Don't fuck him
Don't fuck him
No fuck him
Don't do it
No no no no
But like somebody should
He's asexual
I know
Oh okay then don't
You know what then don't
He's from Nova Scotia
Famously asexual people
Nova Scotians
Did I ever tell you guys
About the time that I got
Waylaid in Halifax
No
I took a work trip
Was it like being
Waylaid in the Windy City
But different
And much worse
Okay
I took a work trip
Did you come from away
I did come from away
Yes actually
I was in Prince Edward Island
I literally came from away
So I was in Prince Edward Island
Welcome to the Rock bitch
I was in Prince Edward Island
And I was supposed to take
A direct flight
From PEI
Back to New York City
Yeah
But there was a Nor'easter
That came in
And so I wasn't able to
That flight got cancelled
And so I had to get on
The next connecting flight
Which was to Halifax
Right
Okay
It was the very last flight
That was going out
And I don't think
And there was this red-headed orphan
On the plane next to him
And her adoptive parents
Who were a brother and sister
Yeah
And I don't think
That I've ever been
On a more like
Nausea inducing flight
Because it still took off
And it was flying
Into a Nor'easter
Oh Jesus God
By the time we landed
In Halifax
There were
There were like
I think two inches
Of actual solid
Ice
On the ground
Not snow
Yeah
Ice
Jesus God
Because I've had that
In Grand Rapids once
Yeah
It was that like
Really awful freezing rain
That you get
When it's just
The wrong temperature
Jesus
Yeah yeah yeah
And so then
The thing about Halifax airport
Is that it is a long ass way
From the city of Halifax
Oh like Denver
Oh yeah
And when you have to drive
Roughly 25 to 30 miles per hour
Down a highway
That is black ice
The whole way
Jesus God
Probably yeah
It would have just been better
To stay in Avonlea or whatever
Yes
Anyway I do hope
One day
To go back to Halifax
To meet
Starling Jarvis
Sterling Jarvis
And
And shake his hand
And shake his hand
Yeah
He does a great job
In this song
And it is funny
That like K. Rool
And all the
All those minions
Like really get into the song too
Yeah
Like they're affected
By the singing
All the singing
Is quite good
And it's matched
Quite well
With the speaking voices
And
It's even more impressive
When you consider the fact
That this is a translation
Right
Yeah
Like this is a French show
It means that they mastered it properly
They
They
They developed it to get localized
Right
So that other people
Can write lyrics for it
You know
That
I think that's something
That always jumps out at me
About this right
Is that
The animation
Pretty much uniformly terrible
But the sound
From a technical perspective
Pretty good
Pretty well done
Yeah
Particularly considering
The very clear constraints
That they were under
When making the show
And I think
There is a tendency
In general
When you are looking
At a piece of media
That didn't turn out well
Yeah
And the Donkey Kong
Country animated series
Is one of those
Yes
And I imagine
That the people
Who worked on the show
Would admit as much
I think there is a tendency
There to just like
Laugh at the thing
And be like
Haha
This fucking dumbass shit
Like and who
Fucking idiots made this
But it's like no
You can see
That the people
Were doing
The people who made this
Were doing the best
They could
With what they had
Yeah
And I think
That's kind of interesting
Just like my good friend
Ub Iwerks
Sorry
I'm sorry
Just like my good friend
Ub Iwerks
Who along with his
His creative partner
Walter Elias Disney
For God's sake
Animated the
The classic
Steamboat Willie
Starring me
Right
Mickey Mouse
Mickey Mouse
Right
And Ub Iwerks
Aside from having
Just one of the
Strangest names
Known to mankind
I thought
It sounds like something
Buried by Disney
I feel like I was
Having a stroke
When you said that name
I was like what
It generally feels like
A name that Bart
Calls in to Moe
In order to get him
To say something dirty
You have these two guys
Ub Iwerks
And
Ub Iwerks
Obviously Walt
Is not a strange name
But his last name
Is Disney
Which is like
What is that
It's apparently
Kind of French
But it got
Anglicized somewhere
Along the way
Like this show
Yeah
But weirdly named
Men and Ub Iwerks
Got absolutely screwed
By Disney
Because you don't even
Know his fucking name
Right
And the company
Is just called Disney
But what's interesting
About Donkey Kong
Is like yeah
It got play in the US
And Canada
And no one really
Gave a shit
They'd much rather
Watch a reboot
Or Beast Wars
Transformers
You know
Right
But it was a big hit
In Japan
It played in a
Prime time slot
In Japan
Really
On Tokyo TV
6.30pm
In the slot
That when the show
Ended
It got replaced
By Hamtaro
Wow
When you work together
It is much better
My best friends
Little hamsters
Big adventures
Yeah my ham ham
Yeah
You teach me
And I teach you
Yes
That's really interesting
But it was also
I don't know
Where that came from
So this episode
Wraps up
More or less
The way that you
Would expect
That the song
Is so powerful
Yes
That Karel just lets them leave
Because he's so overtaken
By the
By the cream pies
Yeah and this is again
A very huge creative swing
For them
Because they've gotten
Right
DK and Candy together
At the beginning
You know
It's like Parks and Rec
You get Andy and April
Together at the beginning
There
And then it becomes
Not a show about
Will they won't they
But about like
How do you actually
Navigate relationships
Right
Which this show also does
With the subtlety
Of Parks and Recreation
Oh absolutely
So my question is
What's gonna happen
To the bananas
Are they gonna be okay
I don't know
Bananas wise
I don't know
What about this curse
This curse
That is before the bananas
Yeah and leave us
On a cliffhanger
No well they return the banana
They do return it
Remember
But then someone tries
To steal it
Because it's K. Rool
Goes in to try and steal the banana
And then K. Rool
Gets cursed in turn
Right
Yes
So the bananas are fine now
It's just whatever K. Rool
Apparently lily pads
Whatever he's into
Those get threatened
Well and it's interesting
That you mention lily pads
Because the fourth and final episode
That we watched
For this episode
Of the worst of all possible worlds
Was
Featuring Mickey Mouse
That's right
Was episode 38
It's a wonderful life
Quick note here
No they didn't do a pun
They didn't do a plan
It's a wonderful life
It's just
It's a wonderful life
It could have called
It's a wonderful banana
Or something
That wouldn't have been good
It's a wonderful life
There we go
It's a wonderful life
It's a wonderful leaf
Cause you know
Those trees have leaves
Those trees have leaves
Production note
Just right up top here
The sort of second production season
That's a wonderful coconut
Also works for me
Of
This show
Was animated by a different studio
Yes
It's a studio called
Hongguang Animation
Yeah
This is a Taiwanese studio
I think the puppeteering
Still happened
With the old studio
But like
The everything else
All the textures
And everything
The renderings
Yes
The character models
Are
You can't do the rendering
The character models
Are higher resolution
The textures are better
The animation
Is considerably better
Here's the thing
It's like
Better in a technical sense
Yeah
But like
Some of the things
That Donkey Kong's
Brow starts to do
Is just awful
Un-Christian
Deeply un-Christian
This episode opens
With DK
He's blowing it
Not as per usual
Honestly
He's wrecked
Funky's surfboard
He's put the crystal coconut
Under an impenetrable lock
He can't remember
The combination for
Yeah
Well there's a good gag
For that one too
Yeah
There's a shout out
To that right
Because they
You know
Cranky's like
Donkey's like
You're always stealing
This fucking
I put a lock on it
Right
And it's like
This episode
Seems to be a series
Reckoning with itself
In a very fun way
Yeah
And there's a
There's a funny little thing
This feels like
It should be the finale
It's like two episodes
Away from the finale
And
Episode 38 of 40
This actually has a funny gag
Right here where he says
There's more than one way
To remove a lock
And he tries to just
Sort of hit it a bunch
And he's like
Oh I guess there is
Only one way
To remove a lock
Well I want to talk
A little bit about
Donkey Kong as a character
Because we've been talking
Sort of around it
For a while now
But he's a himbo
Right
He's just
Yeah
A very big
Strong
Dopey guy
Yeah
And this was a thing
That was not present
In the original games
Right
It's also that
Yeah
Even in Donkey Kong 64
He doesn't really have
Strong discernible
Character traits
You know
Well they give the big dope
To Chunky
Right
In TK64
So Donkey Kong becomes
Much more
Where did Chunky go
Yeah
Where is he
Where is Chunky
I miss Chunky
Where's Lanky
Where's Lanky
Lanky can go fucking
Rot wherever he is
I don't ever want to
See him back
Wow
Sorry
He knows what he did
Sore subject
Anyway go ahead AJ
No no
I just
Fucked my wife
It was bad enough
It was bad enough
That she fucked Goofy
And whenever I told people
That she was fucking Goofy
They thought it just meant
That she was
Mentally unwell
Right
So that's how I got those horns
The hook
But I didn't say she was crazy
I said
She was fucking Goofy
There's a bit where
It's hard to compete with Lanky
It is
It is hard
It's hard to compete with Lanky
He's so lanky
He's lanky all over
Yeah
You know what they say
This Kong has a funny face
Yeah
That's what they say
He plays the trombone
It was actually the first draft
Of the 1776 song
And I think there's something
That is very rare in video games
For a character to be
Intentionally dumb
Yeah
Right
For a protagonist to be
Intentionally dumb
And I kind of wish
There was more of this
In the video game
Yeah
I wish more of this
Characterization of Donkey Kong
Shows up more in like
Banjo-Kazooie
Where Banjo's really dumb
Right
But he has Kazooie to be like
Yeah
Stupid fuck
No it would be really fun
To play a game
As just a very
Which I mean people do that right
Like people do the fallout run
Where they
They take away all the intelligence
And speech points
And you just play as like
A stupid extremely violent rectangle
Or like Disco Elysium
With no intelligence
Is a very fun thing to play
Yeah
Right
And I think they actually did
A really good job of adapting
What was basically
Nothing
I think it was described
In that Polygon article
As cardboard cutouts
Yeah
Right
And making them into like
Actual characters
I think it's pretty impressive
Yeah
At this point I think
In the development of the show
They had a stronger head
Around what they wanted to do
With these characters
Because this is a very meta episode
Right
Right
The very nature of the destruction
That DK is doing
Is meta
The fact that he
Put the crystal coconut
Under impenetrable locks
That he can't remember
The combination for
Like you said
That's a meta reference
The way that he
Ruins Candy's chances
For a raise
At the barrel factory
Because he thinks
That it's just
Bluster hitting on her
Well he is doing that
But that also like
Candy is
Constantly
Responsive to his advances
Which she is not
You can also see
That the scenery
In this episode
Is way more populated now
Like the factory
Is not just
A giant
Empty room
With one conveyor belt
Anymore
You know
And like Cranky Kong's house
Has just a bunch of stuff
In it now
The other big thing
That Donkey Kong then does
Is he comes across Diddy
Diddy is playing
With his favorite baseball
Favorite baseball
And I think we all can see
Where this is going
Hey Diddy
Toss it over here
No way DK
This is my lucky ball
Just one throw
I'll throw it right back
Cross my eyes
And hope to spit
Okay
If you promise
To throw it right back
This is
My favorite ball
In the whole wide world
Promise
Now let her rip
Okay DK
That was great
And now can you just
Toss my ball back
Gently
Here it comes
Little buddy
Right down the pipe
Whoa
You just lost
My lucky ball
Sorry little buddy
Sorry isn't good enough
Donkey Kong
Why couldn't you
Have disappeared forever
Instead of my ball
Jesus
Wrecked
But also
To be fair
That was the only
Baseball
In Congo
Bongo
Do you see
A baseball
Factory
With the eight
People who live here
No certainly not
No he has destroyed
Any possibility
Of Diddy Kong
Ever joining
The Astros
Because he cheats
Is that the implication
Yes
Also uh
Yeah it should be noted
Congo Bongo
Five miles off
Of the coast of Texas
Oh okay
Got it
So something that
Jumps out at me
About the writing here
And you can kind of hear it
It is now mechanically
Sound
Reasonably so
Right
As opposed to those
Earlier episodes
Which are not
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
It's not good
It's mechanically
Still quite weird
I don't know
Yeah
Well he does
Briefly take a nap
Brian
Because there's nothing
A good nap can't solve
Except that it makes
The problem worse
Right
Because he misses
His big dinner
Tonight's only
The annual
Future ruler
Of Congo Bongo
Barbecue banana dinner
At which you
Were supposed to be
The guest of honor
Oh I completely forgot
Diddy
Can you tell everybody
I was busy fighting evil
Or something like that
Tell him yourself
DK
Thanks for ruining
Our evening DK
Jesus candy
So funny
It's all
Diddy walks in on him
In his house
And talking to Kong
He's like
Oh Diddy
I'm so sorry
Wait I'm not sorry
I live here
What the fuck are you doing
I also like the
Pan pipes there
In the background
That's the same pan pipes
That you will hear
In the ocean lab
In Deus Ex
I was like
That's the same
Sound font
Wow
These are the things
That jump out at me
When I listen to music
It's like
That's that synthesizer
It's a nice video game
Throw out
You know
It's all one big community
But yeah
DK
After getting
Just raked over the coals
By the residents
Of Congo Bongo
He's fucking out of here man
Yeah he's gone
That's it
Goodbye
He's got a bindle over
His shoulder
Bindle time
He's walking through
The forest at night
And Sterling Jarvis
He did not need to go
This hard
But he did
Why should I stay
When all I do
Is get in the way
They think I'm a clown
They push me around
Well maybe
They'd be better off
If I wasn't around
Why should I stay
Why should I stay
Why should I stay
When they treat me
They treat me that way
If I
If I
If I
If I
What's
I'm trying
Donkey Kong auditioning for Dreamgirls
Yeah
He also runs into a tree
I think it's a very well executed song
If you're trying to execute writing a bad song
Okay
Yeah
What I think this accomplishes
Is it gives you
An interiority into a
Kid show character
That I think
Was difficult at the time
What did you learn about Donkey Kong
From this song
That you didn't already have
From him
Actively leaving the place
That he was at
With a bindle
Well I got
The bindle tells you everything
I got that
But can the bindle riff
Like an angel
You're talking about those runs
Yeah
Those vocal runs
What does that tell you
About the character
That he can sing
That he can sing
That he can sing
So well
Then we have some questions
About the diegesis
Of this song
Is this a song
In the universe
Of Donkey Kong Country
Yes
If so
Where are those instruments
Coming from
They're in his mind
Yeah
Oh they're in his mind
But his singing
Is not also in his mind
Have you never gone around
And just sung a song
Accompanied by instruments
In your own head
Have you ever gone around
And not been a little bitch
Have you ever seen
A grown man naked
Hang around the gymnasium
Everyone's gladiator movies
You know what's really funny
Is that
That is a reference
To this podcast
Because I have never seen
What that is referencing
I don't know what that is
You've never seen airplane
I thought it was
Tim and Eric
Legitimately
This whole time
I thought that was
A Tim and Eric bit
Boy we gotta learn you sometime
We're gonna
We're gonna learn you boy
You don't have a
God damn education
In the world
I'm gonna get my hickory stick
See any of your hickory stick
DK got his hickory stick
Put a bindle on it
Hit a tree
It's bamboo
It's bamboo
And I have a big question
About where he got that bamboo
We see bamboo nowhere else
On this island
It's a big island
There's a hole
With multiple bios
Swaths
Yeah
Have you played the game?
Have you been to Texas?
There's a snow part
There's snow in Texas
Not bamboo
Aha
See
So where did he get
His bamboo bindle?
They imported it
Yeah
Funky brought it in
On a flight
He fucking
Ordered a bindle
Out of bamboo
On Amazon
Waited a week
Before he left
Yeah I was being
Really passive aggressive
About it
He was like
Funky I need a bindle
He's like
For what?
He's like
No reason
Just cause
He's running to a tree
And when he awakens
Uh
Well he's a ghost
DK's a ghost now
Well he's not quite a
Ghost himself yet
Right?
More like a Kennedy
But he does see
A ghost
True
Right?
And the ghost
That he sees
Who is it?
Is Eddie the Yeti
Yeah it's the ghost
Of Eddie the Yeti
Now
Who died?
Hard to say
It's like the opposite
Of Tiny Tim
But they both
The way that you can tell
That they are ghosts
Is twofold
First of all
Visually
They have a
Bright white
Sort of line
Around them
More or less
To define that
They are sort of
An ethereal space
And then secondly
Well we see
The people
The people
These aren't people
These are animals
We see
The other characters
Of Donkey Kong Country
Just walking through
DK
Not even seeing him
Yeah
What's going on here?
He's getting
It's a wonderful life
But also Christmas
Carol
Yes
Yes
Yes
So he is a ghost
Observing the world
Without him
As a ghost
But then he becomes
Corporeal
Semi-corporeal
Well he becomes
Totally corporeal
Eventually
True
And we'll get there
But for the time being
Yeah we start to just
See this world
And what it is like
Right
Had Donkey Kong
Not been born
Because not only
Is Eddie the Yeti
A ghost
He's an angel
Yeah he's his guardian angel
He's his guardian angel
Yeah
And he says this much
Explicitly
Yes
He has a lot of power
Yeah
For a monkey
That just died
Don't worry about it
I feel like
Brian
Brian
I feel like you're
Worrying about it
Yeah
I'm worrying about it
Just don't worry about it
Theologically
This has not lined up
With anything that I understand
It's causing a crisis
Of faith
Sure ain't Christian
Sure ain't Christian
Oh no
Things that have happened
In Konga Bongo
As a result of
There never being a DK
Include
Diddy Kong
Having gone
Completely mad
With power
Yeah
He's gone bananas
So
Diddy Kong
Is one Donkey Kong
Away from becoming a fascist
Yeah
He just straight up
Is a dictator now
And also
The MacGuffin
Now is this special
Little lily pad
That's the special item
Yeah
Right
So they're saying
Straight up
It's a paper machine
Lili pad
We do not fucking care
About this thing
That we've built
All the episodes on
We do not fucking care
About this show
Which I love
Diddy
I genuinely love this
Diddy controls
The coconut
He doesn't want the coconut
He throws it
In a trash can
And instead
He's going to steal
A paper mache
Lily pad
Right
From King K.
Rool
And this is such a
Like very clear
And intentional
Meta
Like lampshading
Like fuck this show
I'm so glad
We're almost done
From the creators
Yeah
And there's also
I think a bit of it too
That it's just like
It's a paper mache
Lily pad
A thing you cannot
Render well
Right
With their animation
Right
So spoilers
When the paper mache
Gets broken
It's just like
It shatters
Like a ceramic
It's a glazed
Ceramic plate
Yeah
Yeah
So it's like
It's like all the things
That it's like
Basically I imagine
The writer's room
Is just like
What do you want to do
In this episode
Like what do we
What can we do
That we've never done before
We haven't done the fucking
It's a wonderful life plot yet
Right
Let's just do that
Yes
And combine it
With a Christmas carol
Yeah
And Eddie the Yeti
Who did die
Will be his guardian ape
What
And so other things
That are going on here
Bluster and Candy
Are fully an item
She's one Donkey Kong
Away from just
Wanting to go to town
All over John Waters
That's right
When Funky
Is right
There
And fully nude
Really unfortunate
His body is available
I guess she doesn't like gingers
But Evil Diddy
Has actually
Yes
Gone
Full tyrant mode
Right
Yeah
He is so obsessed
With this paper mache lily pad
That he
He no longer is even
Showing respect
To the crystal coconut
And this sends DK
Right over the edge
Yes
No
I can't believe
What I see
Everything's upside down
And it makes no sense
To me
In my current state
I can't change the fate
If you send me back
I swear I'll set things straight
You gotta send me back
No can do
I've been dissed
You not exist
What a cut Josh
What a cut
Thanks. So this world that Donkey Kong has now abandoned. Yeah. The home that he needs to that Eddie needs to let him go back to is not worse than it was because the coconut doesn't matter. The only thing is that now Donkey Kong can't fuck Candy Kong anymore. Well, did he's become a tyrant? That's not good. That's not great. Yeah. But King K. Rool was a tyrant before and now he's not. It's the playing field is totally level whether Donkey Kong is there or not.
It's just that he doesn't get the things that he likes anymore. He's going to learn a powerful lesson about that. I'm sure I wouldn't be so sure if I were you because well, Funky is also sort of the brains behind Diddy's dictatorship, right? Explain how dictatorship explain because he's the muscle. But it seems like that Diddy is just kind of like an angry like pop rocket where Funky keeps his cool and actually enforces things that go down. Well, in DK is sort of like gets a chance.
Sorry, I just need to go back a moment because oh sure they did uptown funk before uptown funk was a song that was created. Yeah, yes uptown funk a song famously good. Hey, oh, I like uptown funk. Yeah, you would. Oh, wow. Wow. Jesus. Wow. Uptown funk is a better song than this. But like, you know, you're a charitable man. That's fair. This here's that ice cold. Yeah, no, no, it is. It is. It is.
I can't admit to liking even one of the songs. DK does successfully persuade Eddie to let him go back to his home. He does. He does. Only thing is. Yeah, it's really not his home. Like, no, it's it's still the world where DK never existed. Right. So now they're just doing It's a Wonderful Life. Right. Right. Yes. So he's just showing up and just being like now. No, you have to fuck me now. I'm your boyfriend. Right.
Is he pisses everyone off. Yeah. But that by pissing everyone off, he kind of brings everyone together. He does. Yeah. Yeah. Against him. Against him. Once more. Because he makes everything worse. Yeah. I mean, he he he almost makes a good connection with funky until he puts his fist through his plane. That that that doesn't work out. Welcome, bro. What's shaking? Things are what they seem around here. And I need a friend. The funk man is your karma companion. You're never gonna believe us.
But first I was me. Good old Donkey Kong. And then suddenly I was like. Good old Donkey Kong. Good old Donkey Kong. I've been there, dude. I could. Well, I could put my fist through things. Like this. My plane. Sorry. I forgot. I'm not invisible anymore. But you're sure gonna wish you were. Destructo dude. That's not what invisible means.
Destructo dude. That's not what invisible means.
Destructo dude. Well, he's dumb. He kicks Karul's ass. Gets him to hand the lily pad over and promptly breaks it. And everybody has him surrounded. They knock him the fuck out. And he wakes back up. Because it was all just a dream.
He wakes back up in the real world. And everyone has come looking for him. Because he hasn't actually resolved anything. But they're like, yeah, we're over it.
Because the whole thing that was like, can he be like, way to go, DK.
That was real.
All their terrible treatment of him.
Yeah.
Happened.
Oh, yeah.
It's just that now he's back and he can appreciate that he making them angry brings them together.
He hasn't learned anything.
They just got over it.
The episode is just done and we're wrapping up now.
Right.
But he understands his importance.
Which is to make everybody mad at him.
Congo Bongo.
His importance is none.
His importance is zero.
There's no importance to him at all.
He should just go back to mainland Texas where he was born.
Go back to Galveston, you motherfucker.
I had a dream.
A dream of throwing my first pitch in that Houston stadium.
And it was ruined.
It was ruined by Donkey Kong.
I will have my sweet vengeance.
That's how I would have ended the episode.
Is that Mickey Mouse?
No, that's Diddy Kong.
Oh, that's Diddy Kong.
Yeah, I don't know.
Mickey Mouse was full.
I probably haven't told you this, Josh, but actually I'm Mickey Mouse.
Okay, got it.
And I sound like this.
Yeah, that's how Mickey Mouse sounds.
Gotcha.
Very good.
Can you do a laugh for us, Mickey Mouse?
Ha.
Wow, not even the two.
Two?
You said a laugh.
What am I, a communist?
Yeah.
So, you know, we watch children's shows on this show every so often.
This is actually an adult show.
It's on my business card.
I watch children's shows.
Yes.
And I feel like, you know, this compares interestingly to the other children's media that we've talked
about, be it Adventures in Odyssey, Minions, whatever.
I don't know.
Where do we end up landing on this?
Where does this slot into our repertoire?
Yeah.
I know where I'd put it, which is a perfectly fine kids show with a nightmarish design that
makes it very fun to watch.
I disagree about it.
I don't know if that makes it good.
I disagree about it being a perfectly fine children's show.
Yeah, I think it's not.
I disagree with that, too.
I think it is a purely crass product of the market.
Yeah.
That somewhere in the motion capture stage, obviously there are some artists having fun,
but in the writing, it is 100% just wrote.
We don't fucking care.
The moment they get a little meta about it, they don't get meta enough.
But there is something to be said, I think, for, well, if we got to shovel this shit out,
at least maybe let's have a little bit of fun while we're doing it, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, it is interesting that the musical numbers were a dictation of the French
leadership because it does feel like such an integral part of the show.
Yeah.
Right.
Like no one would remember the show without the songs.
Right.
I mean, I think I'd probably remember it, but like.
It's like a peyote infused fever dream.
As a child's show that has just so much ass in it.
Yeah.
So much unfettered access to the image of a fucking monkey ass.
Yeah.
And some monkey breasts.
Yeah.
Which you can touch.
But only.
The breasts are not nude.
Only ass is nude.
Yeah.
Only once.
Only once.
Only once.
I do.
And, and, and.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Something that I'm going to tell you only once.
Hmm.
First of all, you already subscribed to our Patreon.
So, you know, it is because of your ongoing support that we can keep doing the show week
after week after week.
If you want even more and you're at the $5 tier worth noting at the $10 tier, we add an
extra episode every month of Lad's cast.
Yes.
This month we'll be watching the remaining episodes of Donkey Kong Country.
No, we will not.
We will not be doing that.
The animated series.
But we will be giving our thoughts.
We cannot promise either way.
It might happen.
But we will be shooting the shit about something.
So, you know, if you want a little bit of extra, check that shit out.
But, you know, either way, again, we appreciate you.
And thank you for being subscribers.
If you have a monologue for this, I swear to God, you're like some kind of a golem, like
some sort of super heroic semi divine being.
So I guess what we can take away from this is that after this, Nintendo does not really
collaborate on a show or a property for a very, very long time.
Yeah, they do some things, but they keep it in Japan, right?
Kirby right back at you.
Right.
Oh, sure.
For a little while, but like not a whole lot of other stuff.
Nintendo gets very, very conservative with how it it does sort of the cross media stuff,
especially if it means working with something kind of outside of Nintendo's purview.
Yeah.
And we don't get like another official like Donkey Kong in a major way from Nintendo on
any sort of non video game screen until the Super Mario Brothers movie that just came
out like a year ago.
Yeah.
Last year.
The workshopped to death by the numbers.
Let's just do the Lego movie.
But it's Mario.
Right.
Well, kind of.
I wish it were the Lego movie because then there'd be like a cool meta aspect to it.
But what it what it actually is, is just like the most simple telling of the Mario story.
But the one place where it actually kind of shines is in the scene between Mario and Donkey
Kong between Mario, who's played by Chris Pratt.
Oh, boy.
Donkey Kong.
Well, you see, he's just so good at doing a Mario voice.
Right.
Yeah.
You listen to him talk and you think that I never could have dreamed he'd pull it off.
You think.
My God.
He has.
My God.
It's a him.
Mario.
Truly.
The blocks is so high.
Oh, no.
This man was the son of Mario.
And then Donkey Kong is voiced by Seth Rogen, which I think is kind of inspired casting.
But a lot of Donkey Kong's personality in that one.
He's sort of like a prima donna a bit more in those in that movie.
He's a bit more like full of himself and like kisses his muscles or whatever.
But there is still sort of a himbo element to Donkey Kong in that show.
And where it really comes alive in that movie is between in this like in the road trip aspect
of Donkey Kong and Mario getting lost together and going back towards the kingdom together.
And all of that personality started in this nightmarish show.
So what I am ultimately hopeful for is that Nintendo takes what was good about this show.
And surprisingly, there is some stuff that's good in this show and utilizes that to make
a Donkey Kong show in the vein of the fan made return to crocodile eyes.
Isle, which imagines a contemporary Donkey Kong show that is still a musical, but with
gorgeous animation.
And I will say it much better songs.
Yes.
Yeah.
Well, I think maybe that's where you should have your optimism is that for whatever reason,
because of the way children's programming is, it imprints in your brain at some point.
If you just happen to be a child and you watch this fucking thing at some point, something
in it stuck with you.
Yeah.
The meaning of ASAP, you know?
Sure.
And that inspiration is something that actual artists have taken and transformed it into
something.
And that's always the real, I think the real power of art there.
Yeah.
And you know what I'm going to say when that series inevitably comes around?
It's not going to.
No, not from that.
No, no.
AJ, I don't know what you're going to say.
What are you going to say?
I will say, hey, yo, look out down below.
Okay.
Here he comes.
Banana Slamma.
Uh-huh.
Konga Bongo's hero.
Oh, okay.
I'm the worst of all possible AJs.
I'm Mickey Mouse.
Fuck you.
And I'm the worst of all possible Joshes.
See you next week.
You almost said Mickey Josh.
