36.64 41.22 SPEAKER_07  Welcome to the QAA Podcast Premium Episode 273.
41.60 43.00 SPEAKER_07  Happy Q Year.
43.06 44.24 SPEAKER_04  Happy Q Year!
44.94 49.52 SPEAKER_07  As always, we are your hosts, Jake Rokitansky, Julian Fields, and Travis View.
49.92 51.34 SPEAKER_04  What's up, everybody?
51.76 54.64 SPEAKER_04  Oh, wait, there's a track coming through.
54.64 55.66 SPEAKER_06  I can't control it.
55.90 58.22 SPEAKER_06  Today, I signed a pardon for my son, Hunter.
58.88 62.90 SPEAKER_06  From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with Justice Department's decision-making.
63.22 74.36 SPEAKER_06  I kept my word even as I watched my son being selectively and unfairly prosecuted without aggravating factors like use in a crime, multiple purchases, or buying a weapon as a star purchaser.
74.88 83.48 SPEAKER_06  People almost never brought to trial and felony charges solely for how they filled out gun forms.
84.06 84.58 SPEAKER_06  Forms.
84.98 87.86 SPEAKER_06  Those who are really paying their taxes because of serious addictions.
88.22 89.60 SPEAKER_06  but paying them back subsequently.
89.98 90.76 SPEAKER_06  It's interesting penalties.
91.28 93.12 SPEAKER_06  They're typically given non-criminal resolutions.
93.76 95.70 SPEAKER_06  Excluded, Hunter was treated differently.
96.34 97.78 SPEAKER_06  He was- What, sir?
98.44 99.84 SPEAKER_06  He was treated differently?
100.04 103.86 SPEAKER_04  Dr- Dr- Dr- All right.
103.90 104.40 SPEAKER_04  Oh, shit.
104.46 106.08 SPEAKER_04  We have another track coming in.
106.22 107.54 SPEAKER_04  Today's Auto-Q.
107.54 109.18 SPEAKER_00  It's your boy, Lil' Trump.
110.38 112.46 SPEAKER_00  Swag, hundred million, hundred thousand.
112.46 112.82 SPEAKER_00  Ukraine.
113.08 113.70 SPEAKER_00  Ukraine.
113.98 115.40 SPEAKER_00  Hunter Biden is missing.
115.94 116.88 SPEAKER_00  No one can find him.
117.46 118.18 SPEAKER_00  Where is he?
118.40 119.36 SPEAKER_00  Hunter Biden.
119.36 119.68 SPEAKER_00  Swag.
119.84 121.24 SPEAKER_00  Getting all this money.
121.24 121.50 SPEAKER_00  Swag.
121.66 123.10 SPEAKER_00  I'm Hunter Biden.
123.10 123.46 SPEAKER_00  Swag.
123.46 132.08 SPEAKER_06  The charges in this case came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress investigated and attacked me and my family and opposed the election.
132.62 134.66 SPEAKER_06  Then, I carefully negotiated a plea deal.
135.12 139.02 SPEAKER_06  I greeted it to the Justice Department of Justice unraveling the courtroom.
139.02 144.04 SPEAKER_06  A number of my political opponents in Congress taking credit for putting political pressure on the process.
144.88 148.04 SPEAKER_06  Had a plea deal held, it would have been a fair, reasonable resolution.
148.52 149.38 SPEAKER_06  Hunter's cases.
149.56 150.50 SPEAKER_06  Hunter's cases.
151.24 152.10 SPEAKER_06  Hunter's case.
152.32 153.12 SPEAKER_06  Ha, ha, ha, ha.
153.22 154.30 SPEAKER_06  Hunter's cases.
154.98 156.40 SPEAKER_04  Ha, ha, ha, ha.
157.10 158.34 SPEAKER_04  Okay, you can kill it.
158.38 158.92 SPEAKER_04  You can kill it.
159.42 160.84 SPEAKER_04  Welcome to 2025.
161.42 163.12 SPEAKER_04  Year of Hunter Biden.
163.36 164.76 SPEAKER_04  And I'm calling it right now.
164.82 165.48 SPEAKER_04  Year of Jake.
165.72 167.68 SPEAKER_04  It's going to be bad.
167.68 171.04 SPEAKER_07  It's going to be good for us and bad for everybody else.
171.22 172.92 SPEAKER_07  2025, but it's 2017.
173.50 175.40 SPEAKER_07  2025, but it's 2016.
176.00 177.96 SPEAKER_07  2025, but it's 2018.
178.36 180.76 SPEAKER_07  All over again, man, my face turns green.
182.28 186.08 SPEAKER_04  Travis already has his fingers tented in front of his face.
186.38 186.86 SPEAKER_04  Disappointed.
187.34 188.68 SPEAKER_04  His first disappointment of the year.
189.14 191.56 SPEAKER_04  You know, it's always a beautiful thing to see.
193.92 195.60 SPEAKER_07  We wrapped it up nice for him.
195.66 196.66 SPEAKER_07  We put it under the tree.
196.66 197.86 SPEAKER_07  He undid the boat.
197.98 198.54 SPEAKER_07  What is it?
198.64 199.22 SPEAKER_07  Oh, man.
199.64 205.98 SPEAKER_07  Jake and Julian together in a room, completely dominating all of the audio airwaves.
205.98 210.22 SPEAKER_07  We're fresh off of a little bit of a break, and we're feeling spicy.
210.56 212.34 SPEAKER_04  We're actually in the middle of a break, technically.
212.46 213.72 SPEAKER_04  This week, we're not putting out a main.
214.02 220.04 SPEAKER_04  This is a highly unscripted episode for us, even though we will be discussing QA-style topics.
220.04 223.46 SPEAKER_04  But yeah, I have Jake here next to me, physically next to me.
223.68 223.82 SPEAKER_04  Warm.
224.10 232.70 SPEAKER_04  He's drank at least two-thirds of a very horrifying-looking Starbucks drink that probably has more sugar in it than a Coca-Cola can.
232.96 237.78 SPEAKER_04  And he has his Gatorade-branded water container, which is like...
237.78 242.02 SPEAKER_07  I got it after Travis's episode about Gatorade, after his trickle-down episode.
242.02 244.90 SPEAKER_07  I was like, oh, man, what does this episode make me want to do?
245.00 247.10 SPEAKER_07  Support Gatorade further and better.
247.10 251.16 SPEAKER_04  This is like when they put dog medicine in peanut butter.
251.48 256.72 SPEAKER_04  It's like the Gatorade container makes him attracted enough to drink, and then he's drinking water.
256.88 258.76 SPEAKER_04  But we have to trick him into doing that.
259.78 260.22 SPEAKER_01  Well.
260.76 261.70 SPEAKER_04  How were the notifications?
262.24 262.56 SPEAKER_04  Good.
262.84 263.10 SPEAKER_04  Good.
263.48 263.82 SPEAKER_04  Good.
263.82 265.26 SPEAKER_04  The phone's doing all right?
265.36 270.02 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, well, my wife is sick, so she was just texting me about doctor's appointments.
270.10 270.90 SPEAKER_07  We can cut this out.
270.90 271.52 SPEAKER_04  No, no, no.
271.58 273.82 SPEAKER_04  We won't be cutting this out, and condolences.
274.36 274.98 SPEAKER_07  How bad is it?
274.98 277.52 SPEAKER_07  Um, it's not good.
279.46 281.38 SPEAKER_04  Starting 2025 off with a bang?
281.46 282.88 SPEAKER_07  Not terminal, but it's not good, to tell you that.
282.88 284.36 SPEAKER_04  So what have you brought into my house?
284.60 285.92 SPEAKER_07  No, no, no, nothing, nothing.
285.92 287.52 SPEAKER_07  This is a physical injury.
287.68 290.60 SPEAKER_07  This is a physical, physical injury back.
290.60 296.86 SPEAKER_07  She turned, you know, 37, and everything, everything started falling apart, which is what happens.
297.14 300.58 SPEAKER_04  Her heart is experiencing pains from loving Jake so much.
300.70 304.28 SPEAKER_07  Well, I am kind of like, I'm kind of at the best that I've ever been, so.
304.28 304.88 SPEAKER_07  It's true.
305.08 306.08 SPEAKER_04  Travis, how are you feeling?
306.18 306.84 SPEAKER_04  How is your heart?
306.86 307.42 SPEAKER_04  Are you healthy?
307.52 309.50 SPEAKER_04  You seem healthy out there in the wilderness.
310.00 310.50 SPEAKER_05  Uh, yeah.
310.66 312.78 SPEAKER_05  I mean, I've had a good break.
312.84 320.28 SPEAKER_05  I had some, you know, some people over for Christmas, and like, you know, I got to see, at very least, like, nieces, you know, open presents.
320.38 324.70 SPEAKER_05  And that's always, always nice to see childlike glee on Christmas Day.
324.70 325.66 SPEAKER_05  So, yeah.
325.80 327.00 SPEAKER_05  So I had a good one.
327.26 331.88 SPEAKER_07  We were talking about this, because my brother, he celebrates both Christmas and Hanukkah.
332.28 337.20 SPEAKER_07  And I, you know, we were asking him the other night, we were like, okay, well, which did the kids like more?
337.38 342.60 SPEAKER_07  And he's like, well, it's tough, because, you know, Hanukkah, you know, they're so stacked this year.
342.74 348.20 SPEAKER_07  Like, Hanukkah basically started on Christmas Day, and it goes through, you know, goes through the beginning of January.
348.70 349.94 SPEAKER_07  Sounds very mealy-mouthed.
349.94 363.74 SPEAKER_07  You have Christmas right into Hanukkah, but we were saying that, like, nothing can really beat going to bed and knowing that you're going to wake up and all of a sudden, under the tree, are like a pile of presents.
364.22 367.52 SPEAKER_07  You know, Hanukkah gets kind of portioned out, at least when I was growing up.
367.58 374.82 SPEAKER_07  It was like, you get, you know, kind of an okay present the first night, and then some small stuff over the other nights, and then maybe at the end, there's kind of one big presents.
374.82 377.50 SPEAKER_07  The thing you asked for, the Sega Genesis console, in my case.
377.50 379.50 SPEAKER_07  By the way-
379.50 379.72 SPEAKER_04  This year.
379.72 380.30 SPEAKER_07  By the way-
380.30 381.72 SPEAKER_04  This year he's talking about, of course.
382.12 384.08 SPEAKER_07  By the way, by the way. What?
384.30 407.84 SPEAKER_07  When I was a kid, my grandparents, on my mom's side, did get us the Sega Genesis, and my brother reminded me that the way it was revealed to us is we went out to dinner at Bennigan's, and then we were walked to my grandparents, who had, like, one of those big boat Cadillacs, like, from the 80s, and they just opened the trunk like Tony Soprano, and there was, like, a Sega Genesis inside in the back of the trunk, unwrapped.
407.92 409.20 SPEAKER_07  That's how it was revealed to us.
409.20 411.56 SPEAKER_04  How are you supposed to believe that Santa Claus did that?
411.80 414.92 SPEAKER_07  Oh, there was no Santa Claus in those for us.
415.08 416.10 SPEAKER_07  It was only Hanukkah.
416.24 417.02 SPEAKER_07  It was only dreidel.
417.02 417.64 SPEAKER_04  Oh, wow.
417.74 420.86 SPEAKER_04  So, like, Christmas for you, they didn't even let you have any of the fantasy.
420.94 421.64 SPEAKER_07  Oh, we didn't even do a Christmas.
421.78 422.46 SPEAKER_07  We didn't have a tree.
422.52 422.62 SPEAKER_04  We didn't have anything.
422.62 424.96 SPEAKER_04  You didn't leave out, like, milk or cookies?
425.12 425.66 SPEAKER_07  No, no, no.
425.74 431.82 SPEAKER_07  This only became integrated after my brother and I both married women who were not Jewish.
432.02 434.34 SPEAKER_04  Oh, you're diluting your perfectly good blood.
434.58 436.28 SPEAKER_04  Plus, it's matrilineal, so.
436.52 437.90 SPEAKER_04  That's what some would say.
440.14 443.56 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, Travis, did you get any good Christmas presents?
443.80 446.62 SPEAKER_04  Other than us and our personalities for you, baby.
446.62 453.44 SPEAKER_05  Uh, you know, I mean, you know, I guess I'm a little old for, like, Christmas presents.
453.82 455.34 SPEAKER_04  Maybe a silencer for the Glock?
455.56 456.04 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
456.86 458.28 SPEAKER_05  Well, no, no.
458.66 462.00 SPEAKER_05  No, no, because that would be illegal in the state of California.
463.12 463.84 SPEAKER_05  But I checked.
464.14 464.62 SPEAKER_05  But the...
465.84 469.24 SPEAKER_03  Oh, yeah.
469.48 472.62 SPEAKER_05  But no, I got myself a...
472.62 475.96 SPEAKER_05  There's a new book on Martin Van Buren.
476.36 478.58 SPEAKER_05  It was the first full biography in four decades.
478.76 479.50 SPEAKER_05  So I got...
479.50 480.58 SPEAKER_05  I received that.
480.70 483.30 SPEAKER_05  Martin Van Buren, a classic NFL commentator.
483.40 483.78 SPEAKER_04  Right, Jake?
483.96 484.50 SPEAKER_04  No idea.
487.70 490.60 SPEAKER_07  Travis and I polar opposites from one another.
490.74 494.48 SPEAKER_07  He bought himself a book, an autobiography on Martin Van Buren.
494.72 496.00 SPEAKER_07  Not an autobiography.
496.16 497.52 SPEAKER_07  That would mean Van Buren wrote it himself.
497.52 498.50 SPEAKER_07  Van Buren wrote it, yeah.
498.68 500.28 SPEAKER_07  He bought a book on Martin Van Buren.
500.28 505.92 SPEAKER_07  Meanwhile, my wife got me, like, mods for, like, my proton pack to, like, make it look more realistic.
506.18 507.38 SPEAKER_07  But give it a guess.
507.44 508.32 SPEAKER_07  Who is Martin Van Buren?
508.64 509.38 SPEAKER_07  He was a president.
509.86 510.20 SPEAKER_05  Travis?
510.66 511.50 SPEAKER_05  Yes, yes, yes.
511.60 519.54 SPEAKER_05  Most people know him from the Seinfeld episode where they talked about the Van Buren gang, where the sign is an eight because he was the eighth president.
519.60 520.30 SPEAKER_07  I just guessed that.
520.34 521.08 SPEAKER_07  I just said that.
521.20 521.68 SPEAKER_07  I did it.
521.70 522.66 SPEAKER_07  I got an eighth president.
522.84 525.06 SPEAKER_04  I thought he was the dumb little fat kid in The Simpsons.
525.34 526.20 SPEAKER_04  No, that's Milhouse.
526.20 526.74 SPEAKER_04  No, Martin Van Buren.
526.74 527.12 SPEAKER_04  Oh, no.
527.12 528.84 SPEAKER_07  That's just Martin.
529.10 529.50 SPEAKER_07  No.
529.50 534.40 SPEAKER_07  Well, it looks like I'm the dumb one.
534.68 535.00 SPEAKER_05  No, no.
535.06 541.60 SPEAKER_05  I've been digging into this particular era of American history, what they call the start of the second party system.
541.80 542.86 SPEAKER_05  But yeah, I've been reading that.
543.00 544.30 SPEAKER_05  It's been very, very interesting.
544.66 544.90 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
545.10 546.96 SPEAKER_04  I mean, we're going to get into this a little later, maybe.
547.12 549.66 SPEAKER_04  But you're writing a book or something?
549.78 551.22 SPEAKER_05  Are you researching for a book?
551.46 551.72 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
551.80 552.26 SPEAKER_05  Well, yeah.
552.34 553.86 SPEAKER_05  I'm working on something.
553.86 561.20 SPEAKER_05  I'm trying to find some subject matter that I feel like could sustain me long enough for I could do enough to write a full book.
561.30 562.56 SPEAKER_05  And I think I found it.
562.62 565.12 SPEAKER_05  But I think we'll talk about that a little later.
565.36 568.12 SPEAKER_05  But let's start with a little more current events.
568.26 571.92 SPEAKER_04  Jake, are you kind of worried that the smartest rat is already kind of fleeing the ship?
572.48 574.18 SPEAKER_04  He's like, what's next for me?
574.44 575.26 SPEAKER_07  No, I think.
575.56 575.66 SPEAKER_04  No.
576.06 577.88 SPEAKER_04  We're going to be on this thing while it goes down.
577.88 579.04 SPEAKER_07  No, I don't think so.
579.18 579.50 SPEAKER_07  I think.
579.60 580.82 SPEAKER_04  I just want a comfy seat.
581.02 581.70 SPEAKER_07  No, I think.
581.96 586.10 SPEAKER_07  I think he's going to keep doing because he can't stay away from the current.
586.10 586.46 SPEAKER_04  He likes the honey.
586.52 587.18 SPEAKER_07  From the current.
587.66 591.08 SPEAKER_07  And things are no doubt going to get so much more melted.
591.08 600.28 SPEAKER_07  So I think the book is kind of a nice escape from the sort of day in, day out podcasting, reading the news, you know, that sort of thing.
600.36 603.76 SPEAKER_07  So I think it's a nice adenum to Travis's content output.
603.94 604.78 SPEAKER_07  That's what I would say.
604.86 606.56 SPEAKER_07  Did you say adenum instead of addendum?
606.56 609.14 SPEAKER_07  I don't give a fuck how you pronounce it.
609.24 611.12 SPEAKER_07  I don't give a fuck how the word's spelled.
611.42 613.80 SPEAKER_07  I don't need you correcting me in 2025.
614.44 615.04 SPEAKER_04  I just want you.
615.04 615.98 SPEAKER_07  I'm going to pull back.
616.22 616.72 SPEAKER_07  I just, yeah.
616.82 619.92 SPEAKER_07  I just want you to let me say the words how I say them.
620.06 626.54 SPEAKER_07  So hyperbole, you know, adenum, like, you know, let me make the D silent.
626.70 626.98 SPEAKER_07  Okay.
627.08 628.38 SPEAKER_07  Let me make the E.
628.46 631.36 SPEAKER_07  Let me make the E silent as well.
631.54 634.92 SPEAKER_04  Travis, didn't we, weren't we going to do something on this episode?
634.92 636.62 SPEAKER_05  Can you please help us?
636.88 642.78 SPEAKER_05  So, yeah, we're going to try and do some like rapid fire of, of, of current events.
642.98 650.96 SPEAKER_05  The most recent ones like happened in the past month or so is the, the drone sightings started over New Jersey.
650.96 655.12 SPEAKER_05  A lot of people started seeing some mysterious drones that caused a bit of a panic.
655.54 664.46 SPEAKER_05  And this is caused by all appearances was some sort of strange social contagion in which people started seeing strange drones across the country.
664.80 666.44 SPEAKER_05  And then, then this is like, I don't know.
666.50 674.18 SPEAKER_05  This is one of the most, one of the really sad ones because it, you know, people would like show their, like, their zoomed in photos of what the drones were.
674.18 677.96 SPEAKER_05  And it was like, obviously a fucking, like, just commercial plane just coming in for a landing.
678.10 678.58 SPEAKER_04  I don't know.
678.58 679.36 SPEAKER_04  Over and over again.
679.36 681.90 SPEAKER_04  I saw a mothership, an Iranian mothership.
682.04 691.08 SPEAKER_04  And I saw the bottom open up and the little drones in the shape of the Shah were just spreading out over New Jersey, gathering information on, yeah, I mean, the most important part of the nation, New Jersey.
691.36 695.34 SPEAKER_07  Hey, hey, Don, what's it do with all these fucking lights in the sky?
695.34 698.00 SPEAKER_04  And the, and the, the people are like, eh, I don't care.
698.06 699.26 SPEAKER_04  As long as it doesn't reach Virginia.
699.56 702.06 SPEAKER_07  Well, and then there was also something else going on.
702.06 708.06 SPEAKER_07  Cause like with the drone sightings, people were also posting other videos of like UFOs.
708.08 711.40 SPEAKER_07  Like I had this group chat of my buddies and they were like, oh my God, shit's popping off.
711.44 714.00 SPEAKER_07  The fucking disclosures, disclosures happening.
714.26 717.72 SPEAKER_07  I was like, I don't know, guys, like all of these drones are like manmade.
717.72 719.54 SPEAKER_07  They're like, but have you seen this video?
719.54 730.94 SPEAKER_07  And it's like a ring, like a ring camera video of clearly a CGI orb, you know, being composited into the video footage to make it look like a portal's opening up and UFOs coming out.
730.98 731.94 SPEAKER_07  So I was like, oh man.
732.06 737.42 SPEAKER_07  So it was like, not, you have the drones, but then you also have the UFOs and it's kind of mixing together.
737.52 740.46 SPEAKER_07  It was just an absolute mosh pit on social media.
740.74 742.34 SPEAKER_04  He means mishmash, I think.
742.54 743.34 SPEAKER_07  No, a mosh pit.
743.34 745.82 SPEAKER_07  No, all sorts of sweaty bodies.
745.82 751.16 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, sweaty bodies and drones just duking it out in the sky to get a little bit closer to the main stage.
751.48 751.96 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
752.98 760.72 SPEAKER_04  I mean, I do think 2025 we will see a continuation of dissociation, just a trend of like fucking whatever, dude.
760.88 761.76 SPEAKER_04  Drones in the sky.
762.16 765.26 SPEAKER_04  We got a mysterious fog that we'll be talking about a little later.
765.66 767.74 SPEAKER_04  Everyone's just medieval now.
768.02 769.46 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, that's very true.
769.50 773.56 SPEAKER_04  It's time to fucking search for omens in our surroundings.
773.94 775.52 SPEAKER_05  No, I think you're right.
775.52 786.86 SPEAKER_05  I think we're going to start seeing some interesting consequences of the really, the total degradation of traditional sources of authority and information.
787.10 793.90 SPEAKER_05  Because like, you know, people like on all sides of the aisle, you know, there's like much less trust in what's it called in like mainstream media.
793.90 804.44 SPEAKER_05  But also because Trump is taking over, you know, the executive branch, which is responsible for, you know, stuff like unemployment numbers, you know, basic information about about how the country is operating.
804.58 806.20 SPEAKER_05  People are going to trust that less, too.
806.32 809.76 SPEAKER_05  And then, of course, like, you know, even even social media, people are paranoid about.
809.76 820.14 SPEAKER_05  So, yeah, there's going to be interesting consequences from the further degradation of the people believing that traditional sources of authority are less trustworthy than what they used to be.
820.30 821.02 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, I agree.
821.10 822.68 SPEAKER_04  All sides of the one aisle.
822.94 825.12 SPEAKER_04  It's happening on all of the one sides.
825.12 827.22 SPEAKER_04  I mean, can you blame them, Travis?
827.48 828.20 SPEAKER_04  Can you blame them?
828.28 842.86 SPEAKER_04  In a year in which they literally went out of their way to fucking newspeak and bullshit around one of the most horrifying genocides in human modern history since the original Shoah.
843.12 844.52 SPEAKER_04  It's fucking grim.
844.64 846.82 SPEAKER_04  I mean, I don't trust those motherfuckers.
846.88 847.80 SPEAKER_04  They can suck me off.
847.80 850.72 SPEAKER_07  You'd let somebody you didn't trust suck you off?
851.02 852.68 SPEAKER_07  Well, from behind my legs.
853.08 860.22 SPEAKER_05  Just even just, you know, just general, like, Democratic liberals also partially blame the mainstream media for Trump's victory.
860.38 860.84 SPEAKER_05  That's good.
860.98 862.72 SPEAKER_05  So that's a hit on them.
862.82 865.32 SPEAKER_05  So, yeah, so it's going to be an interesting side effect.
865.44 868.76 SPEAKER_05  It's like it's one of those things that's like that's been happening slowly.
868.90 871.34 SPEAKER_05  But I think this is going to take over the past year or so.
871.44 876.50 SPEAKER_05  And then, you know, in the coming months, you know, the trustworthiness of these sources have taken a major hit.
876.50 878.52 SPEAKER_05  So, yeah, I'm an interesting scene.
878.66 881.82 SPEAKER_05  We're going to see a lot more because it's not going to be replaced with anything better.
881.98 882.26 SPEAKER_05  Right.
882.48 884.58 SPEAKER_04  I don't think drop sites pretty good.
884.74 887.94 SPEAKER_04  I like some of these new outlets that are actually doing something interesting.
887.94 891.04 SPEAKER_04  I mean, yeah, but that's not who the main that's who you're finding.
891.12 894.52 SPEAKER_07  That's, you know, the mainstream liberals are finding like the Lincoln project.
894.52 895.18 SPEAKER_04  This is America.
895.30 897.50 SPEAKER_04  I don't care what you find or what everyone else finds.
897.54 898.16 SPEAKER_04  It's about me.
898.32 903.52 SPEAKER_05  I don't think the, you know, these these sorts of things are going to be replaced by, you know, these niche news sites.
903.52 904.72 SPEAKER_05  I don't think that's going to be great.
904.72 905.58 SPEAKER_05  It's great that you found.
905.58 908.66 SPEAKER_05  I'm talking about more broad overall societal effects.
908.78 919.06 SPEAKER_05  I think we're going to see a lot more peasant brain stuff where people are seeing, you know, planes at night and thinking that they're, you know, just Chinese drones or Iranian drones or some shit.
919.06 923.30 SPEAKER_04  We've never had so many fucking billionaires entering office at once.
923.30 931.74 SPEAKER_04  So, yeah, I mean, we live in the feudal technocracy that that is the the result of a bankruptcy of neoliberalism.
931.82 936.98 SPEAKER_04  The end of that idea being a kind of easy centrist solution to everything.
936.98 939.28 SPEAKER_04  And yeah, we're it's going to be good.
939.50 943.02 SPEAKER_07  Dude, we're the we're the fucking SUV in the tree in Jurassic Park.
943.02 945.00 SPEAKER_07  And we're like halfway halfway down.
945.10 953.02 SPEAKER_07  The T-Rex hasn't gobbled us up yet, but we have thrown up on ourselves and destroyed, you know, destroyed a very beautiful historical tree.
953.10 955.16 SPEAKER_04  I am soaked in piss and I don't even know if it's mine.
956.98 957.30 SPEAKER_04  Travis.
957.50 959.32 SPEAKER_04  So, wait, do we want to talk more about these drones?
959.46 960.42 SPEAKER_04  What's what's happening with them?
960.48 962.28 SPEAKER_04  Basically just mass hysteria.
962.56 962.80 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
962.94 963.16 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
963.16 963.40 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
963.40 965.52 SPEAKER_05  Just just just mass hysteria.
965.66 967.48 SPEAKER_04  That was that was that was that was it.
967.64 968.14 SPEAKER_04  It's awesome.
968.22 972.08 SPEAKER_04  I mean, this this goes back to the Gallic people who believed that the sky was going to fall on their heads.
972.08 978.94 SPEAKER_04  It's you just look up to the sky and and basically usually you just go, I have no idea what the fuck is going on here.
979.22 982.76 SPEAKER_04  Sometimes you'll found a religion, but most of the time you'll just be like, what?
983.48 985.28 SPEAKER_04  And you'll make up some insane story about it.
985.32 986.14 SPEAKER_04  Nothing has changed.
986.32 993.12 SPEAKER_05  There's a recent also related sort of like widespread hysteria, like just just the past couple of days here.
993.16 998.74 SPEAKER_05  Which is the multiple people claiming that there is a mystery fog that has descended upon their area.
998.88 1002.16 SPEAKER_05  And so this is how one guy talked about it on X.
1003.04 1003.44 SPEAKER_02  Hey, everybody.
1003.54 1005.46 SPEAKER_02  Josh, it's in a world alternative media here.
1005.46 1011.72 SPEAKER_02  And we are seeing some very strange, mysterious fog everywhere in the world at the same time.
1011.72 1017.26 SPEAKER_02  And when it gets to the point where it's everywhere in the world at the same time, we have to start asking some serious questions.
1017.68 1020.04 SPEAKER_04  I mean, there was crazy fog last night here in L.A.
1020.04 1021.94 SPEAKER_04  I was driving back home days ago to.
1021.94 1026.62 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, from my little family gathering because everybody went to bed before midnight and it was almost midnight.
1026.62 1028.12 SPEAKER_04  And I was like, this is insane.
1028.16 1029.18 SPEAKER_04  It looked crazy.
1029.26 1030.12 SPEAKER_07  It did look crazy.
1030.24 1030.66 SPEAKER_04  It kind of.
1030.78 1031.24 SPEAKER_04  You know what?
1031.40 1037.36 SPEAKER_04  It's actually a manifestation of the mind fog that this entire country has been experiencing all year, Travis.
1037.50 1040.62 SPEAKER_04  Kind of like the slime and Ghostbusters to calling John Carpenter.
1040.88 1043.88 SPEAKER_04  We'd like the ghouls to come now and start to dismember us.
1043.88 1049.28 SPEAKER_05  I mean, I don't think like fog in like, you know, late December is really a natural occurrence.
1049.36 1051.70 SPEAKER_05  It's like all these people who like talk about the mystery fog.
1051.78 1053.66 SPEAKER_05  It's like, have you done any work to have you?
1053.70 1055.98 SPEAKER_05  Have you checked the historical weather records?
1056.14 1056.46 SPEAKER_05  No.
1056.60 1057.62 SPEAKER_05  What do you think we're in?
1057.70 1060.00 SPEAKER_04  We are in the reenchantment stage, Travis.
1060.24 1063.02 SPEAKER_04  The world has become so predetermined, so controlled.
1063.18 1064.50 SPEAKER_04  We're so far from the levers of power.
1064.50 1073.34 SPEAKER_04  We are actively attempting to take folk stories that we make up in our own fucking shattered minds and apply them to what we see.
1073.48 1079.50 SPEAKER_04  We need to reenchant reality and we have no other solution but to invent a mystery fog and a fucking Iranian mothership.
1080.36 1081.10 SPEAKER_04  We need something.
1081.34 1081.54 SPEAKER_05  I know.
1081.60 1081.96 SPEAKER_05  We need it.
1082.04 1086.34 SPEAKER_05  This fog thing is I like because like usually is all the multiple people posting about it.
1086.38 1088.42 SPEAKER_05  It's like, well, this is like this fog is weird.
1088.48 1089.70 SPEAKER_05  I've never seen a fog like this.
1089.78 1090.26 SPEAKER_05  I'm like, OK.
1090.42 1092.78 SPEAKER_05  And what conclusion do you draw from this?
1092.78 1095.62 SPEAKER_05  Like what's the narrative exactly are you claiming?
1095.88 1097.48 SPEAKER_05  What exactly is the cause of the fog?
1098.00 1106.74 SPEAKER_05  You know, it's like just people just going around, looking around at their environment saying, this seems weird to me, even if it's not actually weird, even if there's no evidence that it's weird.
1106.94 1109.80 SPEAKER_04  I think in 2025, we need to get rid of object permanency.
1109.92 1111.70 SPEAKER_04  We need to regress to that point.
1111.84 1112.78 SPEAKER_04  We really do.
1112.96 1119.86 SPEAKER_04  Because, you know, it's like, hey, why be present when the present offers us no way out, you know?
1119.92 1121.72 SPEAKER_04  Why not just like be like, whoa, fog.
1121.72 1123.68 SPEAKER_04  This reminds me of how I eat.
1123.84 1128.92 SPEAKER_04  Like when I have a steak, I'm like, this is the best fucking steak I've ever eaten in my life.
1129.12 1134.62 SPEAKER_04  And then a few days later, a few weeks later or whatever, I have another one and I'm like, this is the best fucking steak.
1134.70 1135.44 SPEAKER_04  And like, that's it.
1135.50 1137.04 SPEAKER_04  It's like this fog is unprecedented.
1137.44 1137.56 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
1137.56 1139.88 SPEAKER_07  I mean, I've always had the memory of a goldfish.
1139.96 1142.82 SPEAKER_07  So like, I think people are finally just catching up to my level.
1143.00 1151.56 SPEAKER_07  But like, the thing is, if you're worth half your salt as a conspiracy theorist and you've got a mystery fog all over the world, what are you doing outside breathing in those gases?
1151.56 1157.32 SPEAKER_07  Then you should be inside, locked up, you know, rubber around the windows playing 2K or something.
1157.40 1160.00 SPEAKER_04  We've had a non-mystery smog here in L.A.
1160.26 1162.08 SPEAKER_04  It's come straight from pollution.
1162.08 1162.48 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1163.60 1172.18 SPEAKER_07  You know, I did read one interesting theory, one kind of popular theory about the drones, which was that they were nuclear detection drones.
1172.50 1173.92 SPEAKER_04  For like a lost piece of uranium?
1174.04 1174.64 SPEAKER_04  I heard this.
1174.76 1180.94 SPEAKER_07  These are like threads that kind of like went, I saw bubble up from the chans and they did, you know, some good business on Twitter.
1181.10 1185.46 SPEAKER_07  But, you know, the usual suspects, right wing conspiracy theorists were sharing it.
1185.46 1198.92 SPEAKER_07  And they believed that there was some kind of nuke that might have been like detonated in space and that these drones were set out to detect radiation, detect if there was any radiation fallout.
1198.98 1201.90 SPEAKER_07  There's absolutely no corroborating facts.
1202.46 1207.18 SPEAKER_07  But it seemed like that theory caught on amongst conspiracy theorists.
1207.24 1212.30 SPEAKER_07  They also loved that there were kind of like local politicians who seemed to be like kind of on board.
1212.30 1215.66 SPEAKER_07  Yeah. They were like, we just went and had a meeting with the government.
1215.88 1217.42 SPEAKER_07  They don't know what these things are.
1217.50 1219.36 SPEAKER_04  Yeah. But didn't the FBI put out like a statement?
1219.50 1220.28 SPEAKER_04  Travis, am I wrong?
1220.38 1223.74 SPEAKER_04  Like, didn't the FBI put out a statement about like, oh, we actually don't really know what these are.
1223.80 1226.98 SPEAKER_04  Like they added to the fucking fuel of the fire.
1227.22 1228.46 SPEAKER_04  I don't know.
1228.88 1231.30 SPEAKER_04  Yeah. If he finally admits it, he doesn't know shit.
1231.62 1234.78 SPEAKER_04  Jakey, this whole fucking time he's been lecturing us, but he doesn't know.
1234.78 1241.66 SPEAKER_05  Yeah. So, yeah. So the DHS, FBI, FAA and Department of Defense all released a joint statement.
1241.66 1243.80 SPEAKER_04  That's a statement after they smoked a joint together.
1243.94 1260.38 SPEAKER_05  It said, having closely examined the technical data and tips from concerned citizens, we assess that the sightings to date include a combination of lawful commercial drones, hobbyist drones and law enforcement drones, as well as manned fixed wing aircraft helicopters and stars mistakenly reported as drones.
1260.78 1261.02 SPEAKER_05  Nice.
1261.34 1261.78 SPEAKER_05  Stars.
1262.00 1262.84 SPEAKER_04  Planets, too, I think.
1262.86 1263.46 SPEAKER_07  In their multitudes.
1263.46 1268.50 SPEAKER_07  I wonder if like the big scary ones that people were like, whoa, whoa, whoa, what is that?
1268.54 1269.94 SPEAKER_07  Are like the law enforcement ones?
1269.98 1272.68 SPEAKER_07  Because I've seen a couple of those police drones in L.A.
1272.68 1273.06 SPEAKER_04  Well, there are drones.
1273.06 1274.66 SPEAKER_07  They're fucking insane.
1274.74 1275.46 SPEAKER_04  And they're scary looking.
1275.46 1285.74 SPEAKER_04  They were running, yeah, these bigger drones over the railroad here to figure out, to find the people who were stealing, like stripping the fucking railroad lines for copper wiring and shit.
1285.74 1287.32 SPEAKER_04  So I know that those exist as well.
1287.38 1293.88 SPEAKER_04  I mean, we're basically trying to like make the police and surveillance state a little more fun for ourselves.
1293.88 1297.44 SPEAKER_07  Let's fucking go back to like a proper like gold rush in California.
1297.58 1297.94 SPEAKER_07  You know what?
1298.06 1302.08 SPEAKER_07  If we're like regressing to medieval times, like get on board, man.
1302.12 1302.64 SPEAKER_07  Oh, man.
1302.82 1303.40 SPEAKER_07  To the moon.
1303.42 1306.30 SPEAKER_07  My graphics card isn't sufficient enough.
1306.30 1307.80 SPEAKER_04  No, you can't mine it.
1307.84 1308.74 SPEAKER_04  You can't keep up with that.
1308.90 1309.10 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
1309.10 1313.44 SPEAKER_04  What you got to do is you got to put all your money in Hawk Tua coin and then get rugged.
1313.44 1314.38 SPEAKER_07  Oh, can we talk about that?
1314.46 1326.48 SPEAKER_07  Actually, that's such a funny, what a funny symptom of like this internet age where this girl becomes like insanely popular for admitting that she's enthusiastic about oral sex.
1326.48 1331.10 SPEAKER_07  She becomes like one of the top five podcasts or something.
1331.18 1341.36 SPEAKER_07  She has like Mark Cuban on the podcast and then destroys it all by getting suckered into some kind of like meme coin and like may or may not have like broken laws.
1341.46 1342.40 SPEAKER_07  People are suing her.
1342.50 1343.82 SPEAKER_07  She hasn't tweeted in a while.
1343.96 1346.42 SPEAKER_04  Honey, I lost everything on the dick sucking coin.
1346.78 1347.84 SPEAKER_07  Like what a fucking dumb world.
1347.84 1349.58 SPEAKER_04  I lost the kids college fund.
1349.90 1351.48 SPEAKER_04  What a dumb world we live in.
1351.56 1353.08 SPEAKER_04  It's awesome and we love it.
1353.08 1358.18 SPEAKER_04  And I actually in 2025, I promise to spit on the dick of the world and suck it with gusto.
1358.76 1362.66 SPEAKER_07  And make a call and make some sort of coin to commemorate it.
1362.66 1366.24 SPEAKER_04  But I believe in all this stuff because we've lost like live to the fog.
1366.34 1369.24 SPEAKER_04  She was going to be on this episode, but nope, she's gone into the fog.
1369.62 1372.90 SPEAKER_04  Annie, well, she lives in the island of fog, basically.
1373.30 1373.40 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1373.50 1373.86 SPEAKER_04  Brad.
1374.02 1375.26 SPEAKER_04  Brad is the fog.
1375.38 1376.76 SPEAKER_04  Brad is the fog.
1379.28 1379.68 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1380.12 1380.40 SPEAKER_04  Wow.
1380.68 1381.24 SPEAKER_04  Great stuff.
1381.24 1382.36 SPEAKER_04  So, yeah, the mystery fog.
1382.36 1383.40 SPEAKER_04  We're all scared of it.
1383.66 1385.62 SPEAKER_04  And honestly, I think it's here to mask the drones.
1385.82 1387.02 SPEAKER_04  That's not a bad theory.
1387.40 1388.36 SPEAKER_04  We combine them.
1388.42 1388.54 SPEAKER_04  See?
1388.76 1389.00 SPEAKER_04  Good.
1389.30 1389.48 SPEAKER_03  Good.
1389.58 1392.94 SPEAKER_04  Do you think the fog took those Sasquatch hunters that died of exposure?
1393.22 1394.90 SPEAKER_04  Oh, that's such a sad story.
1395.26 1397.08 SPEAKER_04  That's so fucking depressing.
1397.42 1399.94 SPEAKER_04  Here, let's read from the BBC News article.
1400.62 1403.02 SPEAKER_04  Two men found dead while searching for Bigfoot.
1403.46 1409.96 SPEAKER_04  Two men were found dead in a remote forest while searching for Sasquatch, also commonly known as Bigfoot, according to authorities in Washington state.
1409.96 1413.36 SPEAKER_07  I love that they had to check with the authorities about what the common name was.
1413.36 1417.98 SPEAKER_04  The two men from Portland, Oregon were found dead after a three-day search was launched on Christmas Day.
1418.06 1419.28 SPEAKER_04  That's a terrible day to launch a search.
1419.40 1428.24 SPEAKER_04  After a family member reported that the pair had not returned from a trip to the Gifford Pinchot National Forest to search for proof of the mythical hairy forest-dwelling bipedal primate.
1428.34 1428.88 SPEAKER_04  Come on.
1428.88 1429.42 SPEAKER_04  That sucks, man.
1429.42 1433.82 SPEAKER_07  This is like spitting on their grave by describing Bigfoot like that.
1434.14 1434.96 SPEAKER_04  Oh, man.
1435.12 1437.34 SPEAKER_04  I mean, what do you- 37 and 59.
1437.70 1439.22 SPEAKER_07  They could just say mythical cryptid.
1439.46 1441.04 SPEAKER_07  Like, people don't know what Bigfoot is?
1441.22 1442.14 SPEAKER_04  Give them some respect.
1442.24 1443.42 SPEAKER_07  Give them some fucking respect.
1443.78 1444.04 SPEAKER_04  Seriously.
1444.40 1445.02 SPEAKER_03  Jesus Christ, man.
1445.16 1451.64 SPEAKER_05  I would say, I mean, yeah, I mean, like, if you're going to go hunt for Bigfoot, you do it in, you know, you do it in June.
1451.84 1454.48 SPEAKER_05  You do it in the warmer months.
1454.52 1455.68 SPEAKER_05  You don't do it in December.
1455.68 1464.58 SPEAKER_04  Wait, in Skamania County, where the pair went missing, a person could get a urine jail or a $1,000 fine if one of the folklore creatures is quote-unquote harmed.
1464.90 1468.20 SPEAKER_04  So, wait, you could go to jail for harming Bigfoot.
1468.36 1468.70 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
1469.56 1474.12 SPEAKER_07  There's probably some technology, some hiking technology that they could have brought with them.
1474.20 1475.02 SPEAKER_07  Isn't that right, Travis?
1475.64 1477.02 SPEAKER_05  I mean, yeah.
1477.14 1481.04 SPEAKER_05  I mean, if you're going to do it in the winter, it requires some extra special equipment.
1481.08 1481.28 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1481.44 1483.92 SPEAKER_04  Search for Bigfoot, like, with care.
1483.92 1485.44 SPEAKER_04  Like, be careful out there, guys.
1485.44 1486.32 SPEAKER_04  It's like, be safe.
1486.44 1488.88 SPEAKER_07  And, like, wouldn't they be hibernating in winter anyways?
1489.30 1491.94 SPEAKER_04  I mean, isn't that when they're at their horniest, though?
1492.34 1493.28 SPEAKER_04  I don't know.
1493.56 1496.66 SPEAKER_04  How is this in a county called Scamania?
1497.08 1500.18 SPEAKER_04  Why is this country so on the nose sometimes?
1500.18 1507.78 SPEAKER_04  Or it could be read because it's with a K as Scamania, the place where they love Scamania.
1508.20 1509.24 SPEAKER_04  Which is definitely cooler.
1509.44 1510.28 SPEAKER_04  God, man.
1510.40 1511.00 SPEAKER_04  This is...
1511.00 1511.78 SPEAKER_04  That's a bummer.
1511.92 1512.90 SPEAKER_04  That fucking sucks.
1513.04 1513.96 SPEAKER_04  That fucking sucks.
1514.32 1515.28 SPEAKER_04  What a shit...
1515.28 1516.30 SPEAKER_04  Like, what a shit...
1516.30 1517.00 SPEAKER_04  Terrible Christmas.
1517.24 1520.22 SPEAKER_05  We are losing cryptozoologists by the day.
1520.28 1520.82 SPEAKER_05  It's tragic.
1521.04 1521.42 SPEAKER_05  I know.
1521.68 1522.34 SPEAKER_05  It sucks.
1522.58 1523.92 SPEAKER_04  We almost lost Jake, actually.
1523.92 1524.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, I was gonna say, speaking of being lost...
1524.92 1525.88 SPEAKER_04  Jake, tell us this story.
1525.88 1533.98 SPEAKER_07  Speaking of being lost to the elements, I initially wasn't gonna tell this story on the pod because I didn't want my parents to find out because I didn't want them to worry.
1534.30 1536.14 SPEAKER_07  But I told them, actually, already.
1536.36 1538.64 SPEAKER_07  So we're gonna get the full story.
1539.08 1542.22 SPEAKER_04  Should we just, like, open every episode by saying hi to your mom or...
1542.22 1542.78 SPEAKER_07  No.
1543.14 1543.78 SPEAKER_07  I think...
1543.78 1544.56 SPEAKER_07  I don't know.
1544.82 1548.46 SPEAKER_07  I have a feeling that they're probably not gonna stop listening anytime soon.
1548.56 1551.82 SPEAKER_07  So I think I just have to, you know, acknowledge that they're there.
1551.90 1552.44 SPEAKER_07  But hi, Mom.
1552.52 1553.16 SPEAKER_07  Happy New Year.
1553.38 1554.16 SPEAKER_07  Happy Hanukkah.
1554.24 1555.08 SPEAKER_07  I hope you're doing well.
1555.08 1556.26 SPEAKER_04  I love and respect your son.
1556.34 1557.32 SPEAKER_04  It's all in jest.
1557.42 1558.64 SPEAKER_04  These are just our clowns.
1558.68 1559.88 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, you really should say that.
1559.98 1560.96 SPEAKER_04  My clown is a bully.
1561.22 1561.40 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1561.60 1565.44 SPEAKER_04  Jake's clown is, like, oh, damn, down on his luck and took another hit.
1565.58 1566.36 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, that's true.
1569.34 1570.48 SPEAKER_07  Last time she was...
1570.48 1574.06 SPEAKER_07  The last time we were talking about it, she was like, I'm worried about you.
1574.12 1574.86 SPEAKER_07  You've been sick.
1574.92 1575.88 SPEAKER_07  And I was like, no, I haven't.
1575.90 1578.06 SPEAKER_07  She was like, well, Julian said something about you being sick.
1578.14 1579.08 SPEAKER_07  And I was like, well, he might...
1579.08 1579.90 SPEAKER_07  Like, who knows?
1579.94 1581.38 SPEAKER_07  Like, who knows what he's referencing?
1581.60 1584.08 SPEAKER_07  Like, this shit goes by so fast on this podcast.
1584.08 1585.64 SPEAKER_07  I've been doing this for like seven years.
1585.64 1590.62 SPEAKER_04  I've been spreading disinformation to like one woman about her son through this podcast.
1591.18 1592.04 SPEAKER_04  I apologize.
1592.38 1593.70 SPEAKER_04  I love Jake for the record.
1593.98 1594.22 SPEAKER_04  We are good friends.
1594.22 1598.36 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, we did have a very nice catch up when I came over for like, you know, 20 minutes we were hanging out.
1598.48 1598.70 SPEAKER_07  It's great.
1598.78 1599.68 SPEAKER_07  It's all love.
1599.74 1600.78 SPEAKER_07  And then we put on the headphones.
1601.00 1601.86 SPEAKER_07  We get in the booth.
1602.22 1603.74 SPEAKER_07  And things get bristly.
1605.22 1605.62 SPEAKER_04  But...
1605.62 1609.70 SPEAKER_04  We support each other on our mental health quests.
1609.84 1610.52 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, on our journeys.
1610.52 1612.84 SPEAKER_04  This year has been a good one for both of us.
1612.92 1613.54 SPEAKER_04  I'll say it that way.
1613.54 1614.04 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, yeah.
1614.24 1614.64 SPEAKER_04  It's...
1614.64 1615.18 SPEAKER_04  I think we're both...
1615.18 1616.64 SPEAKER_07  A year of challenges and a year of successes.
1616.90 1617.84 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, we're both in really...
1617.84 1619.14 SPEAKER_07  We're both in really good places.
1619.28 1620.64 SPEAKER_07  We've overcome quite a bit.
1620.76 1622.96 SPEAKER_07  And that kind of bleeds into this story.
1623.36 1626.70 SPEAKER_07  So I got married in 2022.
1627.66 1631.20 SPEAKER_07  But there was like a huge COVID surge going on around that time.
1631.32 1633.88 SPEAKER_07  And so we were like, oh, we'll wait.
1633.96 1634.62 SPEAKER_07  You know, we'll wait.
1634.68 1637.58 SPEAKER_07  We'll postpone the honeymoon because we want to have a bunch of options.
1637.58 1640.38 SPEAKER_07  You know, we want more options to where we could travel to.
1640.72 1642.38 SPEAKER_07  And then, you know, we got busy with work.
1642.58 1644.98 SPEAKER_07  And, you know, there was just like some challenges.
1645.40 1647.88 SPEAKER_07  You know, our dog got injured and twice.
1648.34 1649.04 SPEAKER_07  And then had to have...
1649.04 1649.76 SPEAKER_07  Like there was just...
1649.76 1651.50 SPEAKER_07  You know, like life kind of gets in the way.
1651.60 1652.50 SPEAKER_07  Life and work got in the way.
1652.66 1657.12 SPEAKER_07  And so finally, three years later, we had booked our belated honeymoon.
1657.12 1661.46 SPEAKER_07  And we went to Turks and Caicos, which is like a small island in the Caribbean.
1661.90 1662.68 SPEAKER_07  Absolutely beautiful.
1662.68 1665.48 SPEAKER_07  We essentially looked up like what is the most beautiful beach...
1665.48 1667.62 SPEAKER_07  What are considered the most beautiful beaches in the world?
1667.78 1670.88 SPEAKER_07  And this beach, Grace Bay Beach in Turks and Caicos came up.
1671.36 1673.34 SPEAKER_07  And I mean, it did not disappoint.
1673.48 1677.32 SPEAKER_07  I mean, pristine white sand, turquoise water, the graphics.
1677.70 1681.80 SPEAKER_07  It looked like I had a 40, 90, everything cranked to ultra on 8K.
1681.98 1682.68 SPEAKER_07  Like it was...
1683.32 1686.44 SPEAKER_07  The ray tracing was just absolutely insane.
1686.76 1694.30 SPEAKER_07  You have to wear sunglasses there because the sun is so bright and reflecting off the water and the white sand that like it's bright all the time.
1694.54 1695.42 SPEAKER_07  Incredible seafood.
1695.64 1697.48 SPEAKER_07  Just an amazing time overall.
1698.00 1702.34 SPEAKER_07  One of the things that we wanted to do is we wanted to like book some adventures while we were there.
1702.42 1710.70 SPEAKER_07  And one of the things that we booked was a kayak tour through this sort of like marshland preserve called mangroves.
1710.70 1717.68 SPEAKER_07  And these are like very shallow areas where turtles will mate and live.
1718.12 1722.86 SPEAKER_04  Mangroves are typically a mix of salt water with fresh water.
1723.08 1732.02 SPEAKER_07  I don't know if that's the case, but they're kind of shallow and you go in these like clear bottom kayaks and you paddle through the mangroves.
1732.14 1737.24 SPEAKER_07  And you can see all of the wildlife and sea creatures like beneath you.
1737.40 1737.54 SPEAKER_04  Am I wrong?
1737.54 1737.90 SPEAKER_04  Right in.
1738.02 1738.46 SPEAKER_04  Estuary.
1738.64 1739.24 SPEAKER_04  Is this correct?
1739.24 1747.86 SPEAKER_07  Well, this is kind of like what gets to the story is we assumed that the mangroves or mangroves, however they're pronounced.
1748.06 1749.48 SPEAKER_04  They're actually called woman groves now.
1749.48 1749.72 SPEAKER_04  We're inland.
1749.88 1761.30 SPEAKER_07  We're inland, you know, and that we would, you know, you would get a kayak sort of like thrown into a truck and then they kind of plop you in in this very shallow water and you kind of kayak through.
1761.42 1762.16 SPEAKER_07  You see some fish.
1762.34 1765.10 SPEAKER_07  You see some stingrays, hopefully some turtles if you're lucky.
1765.36 1767.34 SPEAKER_07  And then you kind of like pop out.
1767.34 1771.78 SPEAKER_07  What we didn't realize is that the mangroves are like kind of in the middle of the ocean.
1771.96 1778.88 SPEAKER_07  We had to get towed out to them by a like a rubber boat with a with a gas motor on it.
1778.88 1784.96 SPEAKER_07  And so what they did is they chained like, you know, 10 kayaks together, two people per kayak.
1784.96 1789.72 SPEAKER_07  And you get towed out by this like, you know, this motorboat to where the mangroves are.
1789.72 1794.28 SPEAKER_07  It just so happened that day that like the water was very choppy.
1794.54 1796.08 SPEAKER_07  The winds were really high.
1796.16 1799.30 SPEAKER_07  And so the water was already kind of, you know, kind of choppy.
1799.66 1804.24 SPEAKER_07  And as we're getting towed out and my wife, by the way, has thalassophobia.
1804.68 1807.74 SPEAKER_07  So that that's like scared of like deep ocean water.
1807.74 1810.46 SPEAKER_07  So she was really, you know, like fighting her fears.
1810.46 1811.50 SPEAKER_07  She was like, you know what?
1811.56 1814.62 SPEAKER_07  And it's funny because as we're getting pulled out, she turns back to me.
1814.66 1815.36 SPEAKER_07  She goes, you know what?
1815.52 1816.20 SPEAKER_07  This is fine.
1816.24 1817.96 SPEAKER_07  Like, I'm actually OK with this.
1818.02 1819.80 SPEAKER_07  This is like we're doing we're doing great.
1819.84 1820.72 SPEAKER_07  Like, I'm not scared.
1820.82 1821.62 SPEAKER_07  Like, this is fun.
1821.88 1823.12 SPEAKER_07  I was like, oh, that's awesome.
1823.12 1833.82 SPEAKER_07  And then like a huge boat came by and the wake from the boat splashed so much water into our kayak that it began to sink.
1834.16 1840.18 SPEAKER_07  Now, it's chained to a bunch of other kayaks that are in front of us and behind us.
1840.30 1848.62 SPEAKER_07  But for whatever reason and like there's some there was some speculation that we had like a faulty boat as well because it happened twice.
1848.88 1850.24 SPEAKER_07  That's the second part of the story.
1850.24 1856.42 SPEAKER_07  Like, all of a sudden, my wife is like, oh, my God, there's water like in the boat, like a lot of water in the kayak.
1856.42 1863.74 SPEAKER_07  And I look down and I just see this clear bottom kayak disappearing underneath the depths of the ocean.
1863.88 1869.68 SPEAKER_07  Now, we're in the middle of like a fairly deep channel because they're hauling us out over to this thing.
1870.00 1871.40 SPEAKER_07  And we've got life jackets on.
1871.44 1872.68 SPEAKER_07  So I know we're not going to sink.
1872.84 1874.18 SPEAKER_07  But like it's open water.
1874.30 1874.96 SPEAKER_07  It's the ocean.
1875.10 1876.82 SPEAKER_07  Who knows what kind of creatures are underneath?
1876.82 1889.50 SPEAKER_07  And then I realize that my dry bag that has my phone, my wallet, all my money, my credit cards, ID, everything needed, everything needed for a trip is like gone.
1889.82 1890.12 SPEAKER_07  What?
1890.34 1893.24 SPEAKER_07  And I'm like, oh, my God, my fucking dry bag.
1893.48 1896.22 SPEAKER_07  It was in the kayak and it just fucking sank.
1896.30 1899.62 SPEAKER_07  And I have this moment of like absolute dread.
1899.62 1902.74 SPEAKER_07  And this woman behind me was like, it's going to be OK.
1902.94 1903.50 SPEAKER_07  You're OK.
1903.60 1904.44 SPEAKER_07  And I was like, no, no, no.
1904.60 1905.86 SPEAKER_07  I was like, I know we're going to live.
1905.96 1907.72 SPEAKER_07  I was like, but my fucking bag.
1907.80 1909.48 SPEAKER_07  And she was like, I got it.
1909.80 1913.12 SPEAKER_07  So this couple behind us, they had floated off.
1913.22 1915.94 SPEAKER_07  It floated off like as the kayak sank.
1916.28 1917.90 SPEAKER_07  So you literally fumbled the bag.
1918.26 1920.06 SPEAKER_07  She she somehow grabbed it.
1920.16 1923.52 SPEAKER_07  The guides are like, swim to the sandbar, swim to the sandbar.
1923.52 1927.70 SPEAKER_07  And I look out and like maybe 50 meters away from us, I can kind of see that it's more shallow.
1927.98 1928.86 SPEAKER_07  So we're like swimming.
1929.10 1933.22 SPEAKER_07  And by the way, I'm fully clothed because we don't think that we're going swimming.
1933.34 1936.68 SPEAKER_07  It's like we thought it was like a very lazy kayak tour.
1936.86 1939.56 SPEAKER_07  So and I've got to tell you my outfit because it's really funny.
1939.70 1946.90 SPEAKER_07  I'm wearing like a bucket hat, you know, to protect from the sun.
1947.24 1949.26 SPEAKER_07  I've got this big bucket hat on.
1949.32 1951.50 SPEAKER_07  Like I look like a 90s like B-boy.
1951.50 1956.18 SPEAKER_07  I've got a white Tommy Bahama t-shirt on and white trunks.
1956.36 1961.90 SPEAKER_07  So I look like at one point I told one of the guides that I did a podcast and he goes, let me guess, music.
1962.28 1963.62 SPEAKER_07  So that's what I look like.
1963.62 1964.64 SPEAKER_07  That's what I looked like.
1965.04 1967.88 SPEAKER_07  Sank, totally soaked, entire things.
1968.30 1976.82 SPEAKER_07  Now, the hardest part was that like we have these life vests on, but they're so big that they're kind of like we're at the bottom of the life vest, if that makes any sense.
1976.82 1978.12 SPEAKER_07  Because they were like so big.
1978.12 1987.42 SPEAKER_07  And so I'm trying to swim, both me and my wife are trying to like swim to the sandbar with these huge life vests that are basically, you know, they're like, you know, a foot above our heads.
1987.60 1990.56 SPEAKER_07  But we get to the sandbar and we get like thrown into this boat.
1990.64 1995.88 SPEAKER_07  And there's one other woman in the boat, a tourist, who came to the tour alone so she couldn't be dragged out in a kayak.
1996.08 1996.76 SPEAKER_07  Her name was Kathy.
1996.86 1997.42 SPEAKER_07  We got into the boat.
1997.48 1998.64 SPEAKER_07  She was like, hi, I'm Kathy.
1998.78 2000.02 SPEAKER_07  Boy, you guys sunk, huh?
2000.10 2001.54 SPEAKER_07  She was like from Tennessee or something.
2001.78 2002.48 SPEAKER_07  So we were okay.
2002.64 2003.36 SPEAKER_07  Everything was fine.
2003.36 2012.42 SPEAKER_07  We go to this island called Iguana Island, and this is an uninhabited small island cave where like there's just iguanas that live on it.
2012.46 2012.96 SPEAKER_07  Very cool.
2013.18 2013.70 SPEAKER_07  Very nice.
2013.90 2014.96 SPEAKER_07  And, you know, it was weird.
2015.04 2017.16 SPEAKER_07  We were like, okay, all right, I guess we're okay.
2017.36 2019.96 SPEAKER_07  They basically were like, we're not letting you get into this kayak again.
2020.14 2022.88 SPEAKER_07  Get into the rubber boat and we'll drive you to the mangroves.
2022.92 2023.90 SPEAKER_07  We get to the mangroves.
2023.98 2025.00 SPEAKER_07  We get back in our kayak.
2025.26 2026.16 SPEAKER_07  It's amazing.
2026.16 2026.92 SPEAKER_07  We see fish.
2027.02 2030.78 SPEAKER_07  We see turtles, like huge sea turtles swimming underneath us.
2030.98 2031.42 SPEAKER_07  Incredible.
2031.66 2032.58 SPEAKER_07  Amazing experience.
2032.74 2033.78 SPEAKER_07  Very shallow water.
2034.16 2034.44 SPEAKER_07  Beautiful.
2035.00 2040.90 SPEAKER_07  Then it was time to tow us back to like where the, you know, where we had set off from.
2041.12 2044.42 SPEAKER_07  And there's kind of some fight going on between the tour guides.
2044.42 2047.98 SPEAKER_07  Like somebody like left, like didn't fill the boat with gas or something.
2048.08 2049.10 SPEAKER_07  There's some kind of argument.
2049.20 2053.40 SPEAKER_07  And they kind of forget that we're not supposed to be in our kayak because it might be broken.
2053.40 2056.78 SPEAKER_07  And they hook us up again and start towing us back across the channel.
2056.94 2060.96 SPEAKER_07  And my wife and I are like, oh, well, I guess maybe they think it's okay.
2061.08 2063.24 SPEAKER_07  Maybe the water is like not as deep going back.
2063.32 2067.04 SPEAKER_07  Like they definitely would have come and pulled us if like we were at risk of sinking again.
2067.04 2067.42 SPEAKER_07  Right.
2067.46 2068.34 SPEAKER_07  And we were like, yeah, okay.
2068.72 2070.78 SPEAKER_07  So you start pulling us back and it's okay.
2070.80 2071.86 SPEAKER_07  There's no water in the kayak.
2071.94 2073.48 SPEAKER_07  We're like, okay, like maybe we got this.
2073.52 2074.68 SPEAKER_07  We started to get confident.
2074.68 2077.10 SPEAKER_07  And we were like, all right, like we're okay.
2077.18 2077.54 SPEAKER_07  We're okay.
2078.02 2078.98 SPEAKER_07  Same thing happens.
2079.04 2080.64 SPEAKER_07  A huge boat comes by.
2080.64 2083.42 SPEAKER_07  Huge wake splashes into the kayak.
2083.68 2089.88 SPEAKER_07  And this time, now my wife and I are like cartoon characters trying to toss the water.
2090.00 2090.10 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
2090.24 2093.14 SPEAKER_07  Bail the water out of the thing with our hands.
2093.24 2094.32 SPEAKER_07  It's worthless.
2094.70 2096.10 SPEAKER_07  The boat starts to sink again.
2096.20 2098.22 SPEAKER_07  I can't fucking believe this.
2098.66 2098.96 SPEAKER_04  But now.
2098.96 2100.22 SPEAKER_04  They tricked you into getting in again.
2100.22 2106.04 SPEAKER_07  But now we are in the middle of like a super wide channel that they said was 80 feet deep.
2106.16 2109.14 SPEAKER_07  So this is a serious part of like the ocean.
2109.28 2110.46 SPEAKER_07  The waves are choppy.
2110.64 2117.18 SPEAKER_07  And it is clear that the guides are like much more worried about like this sinking.
2117.80 2117.98 SPEAKER_07  So.
2118.46 2119.62 SPEAKER_07  And here's what's funny.
2119.88 2120.94 SPEAKER_04  These guides probably.
2121.16 2122.30 SPEAKER_07  They were like, oh, fuck.
2122.38 2124.62 SPEAKER_07  They were like, well, one, we forgot that their kayak was broken.
2124.72 2125.90 SPEAKER_07  We put them back in again.
2125.96 2127.00 SPEAKER_07  They're going to leave a bad review.
2127.32 2128.44 SPEAKER_07  We didn't, obviously.
2128.44 2131.22 SPEAKER_04  But there's worse things that can happen to them if you die.
2131.58 2132.34 SPEAKER_04  If we die.
2132.42 2132.54 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2132.64 2133.22 SPEAKER_07  If we die.
2133.36 2133.88 SPEAKER_07  And we're in the middle.
2133.98 2134.80 SPEAKER_07  And there's tons of boats.
2134.94 2139.04 SPEAKER_07  These guys are trying to flag down these huge boats to be like, stop, stop.
2139.04 2140.34 SPEAKER_07  So there's all this commotion.
2140.64 2141.50 SPEAKER_07  We're in the water.
2141.80 2142.90 SPEAKER_07  And you know what's so funny?
2143.10 2146.40 SPEAKER_07  And I always, I think human beings in our brains are so interesting.
2146.40 2150.42 SPEAKER_07  Because when we're faced with true peril, the things that we think about are really funny.
2150.66 2156.60 SPEAKER_07  In my case, I had these little flippy flops on these like Birkenstock rubber flippies that are like kind of too big for me.
2156.64 2158.78 SPEAKER_07  And I was like, oh, I don't want to lose my Birkenstock.
2158.78 2161.74 SPEAKER_07  If I actually try to tread water and kick and swim for my life.
2161.74 2162.64 SPEAKER_04  He's kicking his little feet.
2162.74 2163.76 SPEAKER_04  He like kicked the floor.
2163.76 2168.74 SPEAKER_07  Like if I want to like kick for my life and swim, like I might lose my sandals.
2168.84 2176.92 SPEAKER_07  So I like was kind of swimming poorly because I was trying to mitigate like how much I was kicking because I didn't want to kick my little flippies off my feet.
2177.08 2180.48 SPEAKER_07  Meanwhile, I've got these guides who are, they've pulled up next to us.
2180.54 2181.82 SPEAKER_07  We're both floating in the water.
2182.02 2183.58 SPEAKER_07  It's like Captain Phillips shit.
2183.66 2184.60 SPEAKER_07  They're like reaching over.
2184.68 2185.92 SPEAKER_07  They're like, grab my hand.
2186.04 2187.30 SPEAKER_07  Grab my hand.
2187.36 2190.52 SPEAKER_07  Like clearly they want us out of the water as soon as possible.
2190.52 2197.72 SPEAKER_07  I'm also holding on to two water bottles that were like two empty water bottles that were in our kayak from the trip.
2197.78 2199.64 SPEAKER_07  Cause I was like, I don't want to pollute the ocean.
2199.76 2200.68 SPEAKER_07  I got to grab these.
2200.84 2202.72 SPEAKER_07  I got to grab these like water bottles.
2202.72 2205.24 SPEAKER_04  I don't want to lose my Birkenstocks and I don't want to pollute the ocean.
2205.38 2208.06 SPEAKER_04  This is what you're thinking as you, as you're potentially drowning.
2208.26 2208.60 SPEAKER_04  Absolutely.
2209.06 2209.52 SPEAKER_04  I love it.
2209.62 2210.12 SPEAKER_04  That man.
2210.38 2222.52 SPEAKER_07  Now here's the crazy thing is we're trying to swim towards the boat and it's one of those situations where I'm swimming as like hard as I can and I'm getting further away from the guy because like the current is that strong.
2222.60 2224.00 SPEAKER_07  The waves are that choppy.
2224.10 2225.24 SPEAKER_07  It's madness.
2225.48 2229.04 SPEAKER_07  Our kayak gone, like totally beneath the water.
2229.04 2233.44 SPEAKER_07  And like, I guess, but still chained to these, uh, this like other row of kayaks.
2233.56 2237.50 SPEAKER_07  So I don't know how it didn't pull everybody else down, but finally I get to the guy.
2237.76 2238.60 SPEAKER_07  I grab his hand.
2238.66 2242.72 SPEAKER_07  He does one of those like wrist grabs, you know, like in the, like in fucking mission impossible.
2243.02 2251.44 SPEAKER_07  And with all of his strength, he goes, cause it's hard to pull somebody out of a really choppy water into like a rubber boat.
2251.44 2253.94 SPEAKER_07  That's, you know, three feet, you know, three feet high.
2253.94 2254.80 SPEAKER_07  Like it's tough.
2254.86 2258.28 SPEAKER_07  And he's like, and he just throws me into the boat.
2258.28 2259.24 SPEAKER_07  We then reach over.
2259.44 2260.94 SPEAKER_07  We both, we both grab my wife.
2261.02 2261.80 SPEAKER_07  We throw her up.
2261.98 2262.72 SPEAKER_07  We get in the boat.
2262.80 2263.38 SPEAKER_07  No problem.
2263.64 2265.08 SPEAKER_07  His boat, because it's so choppy.
2265.08 2266.02 SPEAKER_04  I guess it wasn't women.
2266.34 2266.58 SPEAKER_04  Huh?
2266.90 2268.40 SPEAKER_04  Wasn't women and the children first, huh?
2268.54 2268.78 SPEAKER_04  No.
2268.78 2270.40 SPEAKER_04  We just first shake then.
2270.66 2270.90 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
2271.00 2271.88 SPEAKER_04  Maybe if we can.
2271.96 2272.26 SPEAKER_07  I checked.
2272.30 2272.64 SPEAKER_07  I checked.
2272.64 2273.28 SPEAKER_07  I checked with her.
2273.36 2274.26 SPEAKER_07  She was, she was fine.
2274.38 2275.28 SPEAKER_07  We stayed close.
2275.38 2275.88 SPEAKER_07  We stayed close.
2275.96 2276.22 SPEAKER_07  No, no, no.
2276.22 2276.70 SPEAKER_07  I made sure.
2276.78 2279.44 SPEAKER_07  I made sure that we were, we were both, we were both, you know, of course.
2280.00 2282.22 SPEAKER_07  And, um, plus it was just, it was easier.
2282.28 2284.66 SPEAKER_07  Like once we were, I was the closest one to the boat.
2284.66 2287.64 SPEAKER_07  So they were just like, whoever's closer, you know, get in and we'll get everybody.
2287.78 2291.18 SPEAKER_07  But then once I got into the boat, I realized this guy's taking on water too.
2291.20 2292.08 SPEAKER_07  Cause it's so choppy.
2292.10 2298.80 SPEAKER_07  I looked down all of his shit, his phone, his bag, everything is floating in about like two inches of water, like in this thing.
2298.88 2301.74 SPEAKER_07  So we get my wife in and like, we're both okay.
2301.86 2303.04 SPEAKER_07  We sit on the side of the thing.
2303.12 2306.28 SPEAKER_07  We make it back to the, the sort of dock where, where we launched from.
2306.28 2310.28 SPEAKER_07  And all of the guides basically came up to us afterwards and like hugged us.
2310.36 2319.20 SPEAKER_07  They were so happy that we hadn't died or like something horrific hadn't, you know, hadn't happened to us and that we didn't lose anything.
2319.48 2326.64 SPEAKER_07  We didn't, cause the second time we sunk, I threw my dry bag around my like shoulder, like over my shoulder.
2326.80 2330.30 SPEAKER_07  So I've got a life vest with like, I looked like a division character.
2330.30 2338.90 SPEAKER_07  I had like a life vest with like the dry bag over it with like the boonie hat, you know, the white, the soaked white tee and like these like white Tommy Bahama shorts.
2338.90 2340.66 SPEAKER_04  You also have the physique of an operator.
2341.06 2341.74 SPEAKER_07  Big time.
2342.86 2348.12 SPEAKER_07  And so everybody was looking at my muscles and yeah, so we, yeah, we survived.
2348.28 2350.36 SPEAKER_07  And all the guides were like, yo, you guys did a good job.
2350.36 2354.12 SPEAKER_07  Like they were very impressed with how calm we stayed.
2354.36 2358.08 SPEAKER_07  And yeah, our, our operator skills, like in the face of two.
2358.20 2358.82 SPEAKER_04  Certain death.
2358.92 2361.06 SPEAKER_07  Two pretty crazy disasters.
2361.32 2362.02 SPEAKER_07  And it's wild.
2362.14 2366.22 SPEAKER_07  It's wild how that shit can affect you because like we were kind of fine afterwards.
2366.22 2368.50 SPEAKER_07  And then it got to that night and I was like, shit.
2368.60 2370.76 SPEAKER_07  I was like, then the trauma starts to sink in.
2370.80 2373.14 SPEAKER_07  You're like, oh man, that was like kind of fucking stressful.
2373.14 2375.44 SPEAKER_07  I'm like, damn, like, but now I'm safe.
2375.44 2380.92 SPEAKER_07  And so once you're safe, your body is like, okay, now we can panic because like we know that you're, you're safe.
2381.00 2385.98 SPEAKER_07  So it was like kind of a rough, a rough start to like, cause this was like, I think our third day there.
2386.10 2387.96 SPEAKER_04  So going on a vacation again soon?
2388.32 2388.68 SPEAKER_07  Definitely.
2388.92 2393.68 SPEAKER_07  We had a, we ended up having like an amazing, but like no water sports, I think for, for a while.
2393.74 2395.52 SPEAKER_07  We ended up going on two more boats.
2395.70 2396.44 SPEAKER_04  You know what that means, right?
2396.50 2396.90 SPEAKER_04  Listeners.
2397.10 2397.30 SPEAKER_04  Go ahead.
2397.38 2397.48 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
2397.56 2402.08 SPEAKER_07  Julian keeps, I said that before and he keeps making some kind of, there's some kind of sexual joker.
2402.16 2402.74 SPEAKER_04  Don't worry about it.
2402.74 2403.86 SPEAKER_07  But anyways, we went on-
2403.86 2405.66 SPEAKER_04  Too many water sports on his honeymoon.
2405.74 2409.38 SPEAKER_07  We went on two more boats after that. We went snorkeling.
2409.66 2411.94 SPEAKER_07  So we, we definitely got back in the water.
2412.10 2412.24 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2412.44 2417.66 SPEAKER_07  So we, we, we were determined not to, you know, not to let it ruin, ruin our time, but it was tough.
2417.68 2421.96 SPEAKER_07  And I'll never forget, you know, being in a water, the waves are, are rushing.
2422.12 2422.88 SPEAKER_07  Oh, I also had-
2422.88 2425.78 SPEAKER_04  I can't believe they were filming the third season of White Lotus where you were.
2425.78 2429.20 SPEAKER_07  That's what it felt like. It felt like, cause the guy was like, grab my hand.
2429.20 2431.14 SPEAKER_07  And I was like, I can't reach.
2431.28 2432.96 SPEAKER_07  And like, the water's going around.
2433.08 2435.62 SPEAKER_07  I mean, I felt like I was in my own action movie.
2435.74 2437.22 SPEAKER_07  It was awesome and terrifying.
2437.48 2439.08 SPEAKER_07  And, you know, we survived.
2439.66 2440.58 SPEAKER_07  We survived.
2440.82 2442.00 SPEAKER_07  But twice we sunk.
2442.22 2443.92 SPEAKER_07  Twice we were almost lost at sea.
2443.98 2444.92 SPEAKER_07  And we prevailed.
2445.16 2448.62 SPEAKER_07  I'm thinking probably mostly due to my video game- Skills, yeah.
2448.62 2450.86 SPEAKER_07  My video game skills and a little bit of Jesus.
2451.16 2451.32 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2451.54 2452.46 SPEAKER_04  A little bit of Jesus.
2452.66 2453.30 SPEAKER_04  He's Jewish.
2453.80 2454.32 SPEAKER_04  That's-
2454.32 2456.48 SPEAKER_07  A little bit of Jesus. So that's the story.
2456.76 2457.00 SPEAKER_07  Thank you, Jesus.
2457.00 2458.16 SPEAKER_07  Do you have any questions for me?
2458.16 2462.30 SPEAKER_04  Uh, like, what was the underwear situation?
2462.50 2464.14 SPEAKER_04  Were you kind of swampy down there?
2464.22 2465.42 SPEAKER_04  Like, was it just a bad time?
2465.64 2467.44 SPEAKER_07  I think I was nude.
2467.44 2470.06 SPEAKER_04  You have a little bit of Starbucks cream on your upper lip?
2470.24 2471.94 None  I think- Go ahead, sir.
2472.28 2475.86 SPEAKER_07  Yes, well, I believe I was naked under my trunks.
2475.98 2476.68 SPEAKER_07  Oh, you were commando.
2476.70 2478.42 SPEAKER_07  Cause I was- They were swim trunks.
2478.58 2484.78 SPEAKER_07  I knew that there was a possibility of getting wet on my trunk area, cause we were gonna be visiting this beach.
2484.78 2487.18 SPEAKER_07  I thought maybe, you know, I'd go for a little dip or whatever.
2487.48 2490.72 SPEAKER_07  Um, but I did not expect my whole body to become soaked.
2490.84 2492.06 SPEAKER_04  Did it bring you closer together?
2492.58 2493.50 SPEAKER_07  Definitely, definitely.
2493.50 2497.36 SPEAKER_07  And I didn't fuck up and do like weird things like abandon her.
2497.48 2498.16 SPEAKER_07  You know what I mean?
2498.16 2502.10 SPEAKER_07  Like, there's a lot of- There's a lot of ways you can fuck up as a partner in that situation.
2502.18 2503.92 SPEAKER_07  Like, you know, you can panic.
2504.10 2504.88 SPEAKER_07  You can make a scene.
2504.96 2506.00 SPEAKER_07  You can embarrass yourself.
2506.12 2510.04 SPEAKER_07  You can completely ditch your partner and try to save yourself.
2510.04 2511.68 SPEAKER_07  Like, I didn't do any of that.
2511.78 2513.76 SPEAKER_07  And so it ended up good.
2513.90 2517.24 SPEAKER_07  It could have gone bad, but both of us like handled it really well.
2517.32 2520.20 SPEAKER_07  We were both, uh, you know, we've got that action movie mindset.
2520.50 2524.74 SPEAKER_07  So we kind of like knew, you know, we sort of knew instinctively what to do.
2524.82 2526.96 SPEAKER_07  We have good survival instincts.
2527.46 2527.70 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2527.98 2534.08 SPEAKER_04  Well, man, I think I speak for myself and all the audience when I say we're glad you survived and you're back in podcasting.
2534.08 2538.14 SPEAKER_07  But wouldn't it have been funny if that's how you had to reveal that I had passed away?
2538.26 2541.58 SPEAKER_07  That like Jake was like lost in like a boating accident, like in the Caribbean?
2542.06 2542.28 SPEAKER_07  No.
2542.36 2543.34 SPEAKER_07  It'd be kind of funny.
2543.50 2544.22 SPEAKER_04  Well, not to me.
2544.48 2545.68 SPEAKER_04  Travis, would you find that funny?
2545.84 2547.52 SPEAKER_07  I might have made the news.
2548.26 2549.16 SPEAKER_04  Jesus Christ.
2549.30 2549.96 SPEAKER_07  What do you think, Travis?
2550.02 2552.12 SPEAKER_07  Do you think I would have made the news if I died like that?
2552.38 2554.70 SPEAKER_05  Uh, I mean, yeah, maybe, maybe local news.
2554.76 2554.96 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
2555.08 2557.24 SPEAKER_05  I mean, not, not, I don't think I would think it'd be a nation.
2557.24 2557.72 SPEAKER_07  You don't think?
2557.78 2558.14 SPEAKER_05  But yeah.
2558.32 2560.22 SPEAKER_07  You don't think Jake would be trending on Twitter?
2560.50 2561.52 SPEAKER_05  Uh, I, maybe.
2561.66 2562.72 SPEAKER_05  I don't, I don't know.
2562.72 2566.58 SPEAKER_05  I've said there's only one way to prove if we're, any of us are new.
2566.78 2571.04 SPEAKER_04  Knowing how Twitter is now, it would just be like, hashtag waterlog Jew.
2571.34 2571.54 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2571.72 2572.64 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, that's true.
2572.72 2573.28 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, it's true.
2573.46 2578.26 SPEAKER_07  They would have been like, man looking like he was on his way to a Diddy White party, uh,
2578.26 2579.86 SPEAKER_04  drowned at sea. Yes, there we go.
2579.96 2581.60 SPEAKER_04  Fire festival jokes or something.
2581.82 2582.20 SPEAKER_04  Mm-hmm.
2582.46 2583.70 SPEAKER_04  Wow, what a story.
2584.14 2588.52 SPEAKER_04  Uh, I am so excited that you're alive.
2588.84 2589.18 SPEAKER_04  Mm-hmm.
2589.18 2592.22 SPEAKER_04  But also you seem like you wanted to die just to make the news.
2592.22 2592.78 SPEAKER_04  That's not.
2592.78 2599.78 SPEAKER_07  I, you know, I always wonder, I always wonder if, if I'll make the news when I go.
2599.88 2600.76 SPEAKER_07  Oh my God.
2600.82 2601.36 SPEAKER_07  I'm just curious.
2601.50 2601.86 SPEAKER_07  You know, sometimes.
2601.86 2604.22 SPEAKER_04  Maybe if you like crap yourself spectacularly.
2604.60 2607.86 SPEAKER_04  Man craps himself spectacularly and dies.
2608.42 2610.16 SPEAKER_07  But, uh, I don't know.
2610.22 2611.92 SPEAKER_07  I think I might've made the news on that one.
2612.00 2613.22 SPEAKER_07  But we'll never find out.
2613.32 2614.30 SPEAKER_07  And that's a good thing.
2614.32 2615.16 SPEAKER_07  And I'm happy to be here.
2615.26 2616.22 SPEAKER_07  Happy to continue podcasting.
2616.22 2616.86 SPEAKER_03  Travis is dubious by the way.
2616.92 2617.38 SPEAKER_07  I love that.
2617.38 2619.34 SPEAKER_07  He's like, I don't think, uh, maybe local news.
2619.76 2620.02 SPEAKER_08  Yeah.
2620.32 2620.72 SPEAKER_03  Amazing.
2621.34 2625.68 SPEAKER_03  At least you know how, you know.
2626.44 2627.20 SPEAKER_07  I love it.
2627.22 2628.46 SPEAKER_07  He wants to keep me honest.
2628.88 2633.52 SPEAKER_05  Maybe you'll make like the tourist trade journals about like insurance issues.
2633.52 2637.46 SPEAKER_05  You know, I think, I think maybe you'd make that news because that's certainly relevant to them.
2637.78 2648.64 SPEAKER_07  You don't think like New York times or something would be like popular podcast host, you know, one of the early studiers of QAnon podcast hosts like dies on honeymoon.
2648.90 2649.38 SPEAKER_07  Like, come on.
2649.44 2650.40 SPEAKER_07  That's kind of a big headline.
2650.40 2654.42 SPEAKER_04  It's like man bullied to death by renowned podcaster.
2654.74 2656.16 SPEAKER_04  And it would be an article about me.
2657.54 2659.98 SPEAKER_07  Well, that would be not as fun for me.
2660.00 2661.18 SPEAKER_04  His self-esteem was shattered.
2661.44 2665.78 SPEAKER_04  And there are accounts that he actually let go and let himself sink like at the end of Titanic.
2668.56 2669.48 SPEAKER_04  Oh my God.
2669.48 2680.64 SPEAKER_04  Oh, uh, I do have a part of, uh, our little like loose document that just says boring, awful politics and has basically everything that happened this year, uh, listed below it.
2680.64 2682.16 SPEAKER_07  Uh, look, this all looks horrible.
2682.50 2686.12 SPEAKER_04  I know we've got Trump assassination attempts slash the rise of blue and on.
2686.26 2687.96 SPEAKER_04  We've got Biden debate fail.
2688.24 2696.88 SPEAKER_04  Uh, they're eating the pets, Trump victory, Musk ascendancy, Luigi Mangione and, uh, Trump not so anti-immigration after all.
2697.00 2699.20 SPEAKER_04  That's maybe we could talk about that last one.
2699.24 2701.04 SPEAKER_04  Cause that one is so funny to me.
2701.12 2705.92 SPEAKER_07  Well, and, and the, the liberals are so interesting about how they talk about this kind of stuff.
2705.92 2709.18 SPEAKER_07  Cause it's like, they're like, ha ha, you fucking idiot magas.
2709.18 2714.80 SPEAKER_07  Like they're not even going to fucking, they're not even going to fucking put like the people you want in concentration camps.
2714.80 2716.34 SPEAKER_07  You fucking morons.
2716.34 2718.50 SPEAKER_07  Like it's, it's, it's so weird.
2718.50 2731.42 SPEAKER_07  It's like, they do this, this almost like they, they kind of like let their cards slip a little bit and like show their own sort of like racism and, and, and contempt for, for, you know, by, by being like, ha ha, you dumb idiot, like tricked again.
2731.42 2737.82 SPEAKER_07  Like, guess we're not going to, you know, guess you're not going to get your fascist overlord after all you dumb fucks.
2737.86 2744.46 SPEAKER_07  Like it's so, it's such a bizarre way to, to try to like own people online, but I see a lot of it.
2744.88 2745.04 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
2745.04 2751.90 SPEAKER_05  It's a interesting phenomenon where, where, uh, all of a sudden, I guess, I guess the, uh, the more nationalist groiper, right.
2751.90 2763.78 SPEAKER_05  I guess the Nick Fuentes types, they sort of like, they switched over from like anti Haitian or like anti Latino racism to, uh, uh, anti Indian racism.
2763.78 2768.94 SPEAKER_05  They sort of like shifted, shifted gears all of a sudden when they're talking about, uh, H1B visas.
2769.30 2788.56 SPEAKER_04  Well, what's funny is that when you hear Trump and Musk discussing this stuff on that dumb ass, like X spaces, you know, what's funny is that both the far right and liberals are like, they're actually secretly discussing that they want to, you know, create a, a, like a set of concentration camps and put minorities in them.
2788.56 2790.38 SPEAKER_04  And one side thinks that's awesome.
2790.38 2792.54 SPEAKER_04  And the other side is like terrified of that.
2792.54 2800.96 SPEAKER_04  And then it turns out as soon as you get these guys, like a kind of guaranteed ticket to the oval office, it's like, Oh yeah, no, actually like I employ tons of H1Bs.
2800.96 2811.58 SPEAKER_04  Like I, because they're on a fucking visa that's tied to the job, they have to actually do everything I say or else they'll get fucking like, uh, you know, thrown out of the country as soon as they quit their job or get cheaper.
2811.82 2813.44 SPEAKER_04  They're more compliant, you know?
2813.58 2831.58 SPEAKER_04  So, uh, yeah, it's like, yeah, of course these guys are just, uh, oligarchs, you know, I'm sorry, but it is funny though, that both people believe the same, like that they're secretly like deep fascists and, uh, that they're like plotting to kind of do all this, like Nazi shit.
2831.58 2837.52 SPEAKER_04  And then, you know, meanwhile, it's like both, both are wrong, but for like opposite reasons.
2837.52 2838.84 SPEAKER_04  And yeah, I don't know.
2838.88 2855.66 SPEAKER_04  It's like, it's interesting to have that happen all the while we are literally doing like the new Nazi shit, like with a liberal, uh, government, like Biden's, one of his last things that he did was make sure that Israel gets all the money they need to continue, uh, the worst atrocity of, of our era.
2855.66 2857.80 SPEAKER_04  So it's, it's, uh, it's really cool.
2857.80 2863.08 SPEAKER_04  And I think all the discourse is really meaningful and, um, just can't wait for more of it in this year.
2863.62 2874.98 SPEAKER_07  One thing that I find interesting, uh, Travis, you and I were kind of talking about this the other day is, is this idea that posting is somehow affecting the incoming Trump administration.
2874.98 2888.40 SPEAKER_07  Like the, I've been seeing a lot of this on Twitter, especially, and on blue sky as well, where, you know, there will be, you know, Trump or, or Musk will issue some kind of statement like, no, like I am not beholden to Elon Musk or whatever.
2888.40 2903.98 SPEAKER_07  Cause there's this whole, there's, there's been this whole kind of, uh, like ad like PR campaign, I guess from the sort of, you know, very online Democrats where they, they call, um, Elon president elect Elon, you know, it's meant to sort of like a, you know, piss off, piss off Trump.
2904.08 2904.16 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2904.18 2910.54 SPEAKER_04  The amount of bad AI where it's like Trump leading, uh, or Trump being led around in a dog collar by Elon and stuff.
2910.56 2912.04 SPEAKER_07  And I'm like, man, weird, weird stuff.
2912.14 2938.80 SPEAKER_07  But like, but then if, if, if anything addresses, they're like, it's working, keep it up, keep posting, keep posting president elect Elon that there, there's this idea that by posting or having a tweet do big numbers that you are actually going to affect these very real power structures that will go on and they will continue to go on and do horrible things, no matter how viral your tweet goes or no matter how many times you post it's working, we're getting to them.
2938.80 2957.84 SPEAKER_07  But I've seen this, this trend happen across, uh, you know, sort of like liberal influencers where they, they truly believe that, that they are somehow controlling the levers of power by, you know, doing these posts or doing these kinds of influence campaigns or operations, whatever they want to call them to feel significant.
2958.14 2958.64 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, I know.
2958.64 2960.14 SPEAKER_05  I, I, I hate that too.
2960.22 2968.92 SPEAKER_05  There's this, there's this fantasy is like, it was like, okay, we've basically lost all the levers of, of federal power, but here's what we're going to do.
2969.00 2971.24 SPEAKER_05  We're going to, we're going to get inside Trump's head.
2971.30 2972.58 SPEAKER_05  We're going to appeal to his ego.
2972.72 2978.10 SPEAKER_05  And then we're going to like put a wedge in between, uh, between Elon Musk and Trump.
2978.16 2979.64 SPEAKER_05  And that's how we're going to get them.
2979.74 2983.68 SPEAKER_05  We're going to, we're going to like post in a way that like hurts Trump's feelings.
2983.68 2996.18 SPEAKER_05  And like, we're, I'm like, no man, here's the thing is like, I like Trump has a big ego, but he has something, I think even bigger, which is like, uh, feelings that's even more compelling and powerful for him, which is class solidarity.
2996.18 3000.00 SPEAKER_05  And he has a great deal of class solidarity with Elon Musk.
3000.06 3000.38 SPEAKER_05  Preach brother.
3000.98 3009.30 SPEAKER_05  And so, so, so it was like, this is fancy to see is like, like you, you, like, I was like, I'm going to drive a wedge between them with my posts and that's how I'm going to get them.
3009.30 3010.82 SPEAKER_05  Like, aren't you embarrassed?
3011.04 3012.36 SPEAKER_05  Aren't you a little sad?
3012.80 3013.22 SPEAKER_05  They aren't.
3013.52 3015.22 SPEAKER_05  They're incapable of shame.
3015.74 3020.22 SPEAKER_05  I mean, it's, I mean, it feels like, man, it's like, oh, it's like, man, you are, you feel powerless.
3020.46 3028.34 SPEAKER_05  And so you're performing little rituals into your computer to try and like, you know, try and weaken the power that's coming in.
3028.42 3029.08 SPEAKER_05  I get it.
3029.20 3029.78 SPEAKER_05  I get it.
3029.78 3032.26 SPEAKER_05  But it's not, it's not, it's not real, man.
3032.60 3038.56 SPEAKER_04  The true way to wield power is to sit in front of microphones and put out a podcast every
3038.56 3039.58 SPEAKER_05  week. Two.
3039.70 3045.44 SPEAKER_05  No, I mean, it's like, I was like, this is, I mean, this is one of the things we like, we very specifically never intend to do.
3045.48 3047.94 SPEAKER_05  We never claim we're going to like change the world with our podcast.
3048.20 3064.84 SPEAKER_05  You know, I think, I think we're going to like, you know, provide our honest opinion and we'll, uh, you know, we'll, we'll talk about things that we personally think are interesting or relevant or under discussed in the mainstream media, but we're not going to promise that we're going to like have a significant change of the world through our podcasting.
3064.86 3069.68 SPEAKER_05  Cause number one, uh, like there are like one or two podcasts that are like actually have that degree of power.
3069.68 3074.90 SPEAKER_05  And, uh, so we can't, we can't promise that we're not going to promise something we can't deliver on.
3075.34 3076.14 SPEAKER_07  No predictions either.
3076.14 3091.54 SPEAKER_04  They're all, and both, and, and all those podcasts are dedicated to either shaming only fans girls or, uh, uh, uh, proposing a new way to, uh, change your diet or, uh, take a pill to, uh, get better gains.
3091.54 3093.68 SPEAKER_04  So we're on the right path.
3093.76 3104.84 SPEAKER_04  Those are the people that have the, the, the tiny levers of power that are connected to another tiny lever that are connected to another tiny lever that we hope might be connected to a tiny lever somewhere that doesn't actually exist.
3105.10 3112.32 SPEAKER_04  Uh, actually this is a perfect moment to say thank you so much to all of the listeners who supported us this entire year.
3112.58 3113.36 SPEAKER_04  Travis is lying.
3113.44 3118.88 SPEAKER_04  We obviously are going to make big changes to the world this year and your money is going to a really good purpose.
3118.88 3120.62 SPEAKER_04  And, um, no, really genuinely.
3120.62 3123.34 SPEAKER_05  I also, it's like, I don't want to, I was like, yes, also, yes.
3123.34 3124.12 SPEAKER_05  Thank you for listening.
3124.22 3127.84 SPEAKER_05  Despite the fact we don't promise to, uh, change the world.
3127.84 3128.54 SPEAKER_04  That's even better.
3128.84 3130.40 SPEAKER_04  I genuinely am so grateful.
3130.76 3141.84 SPEAKER_04  Uh, it's been a weird ass year for me and this podcast is one of the bright spots for me and the, the fact that we can continue to do this and that people have continued to listen and support us.
3141.84 3145.98 SPEAKER_04  That is just, uh, I don't know, just personally a huge thank you to everybody.
3145.98 3148.88 SPEAKER_04  Including all the haters and the losers.
3149.10 3149.96 SPEAKER_04  Keep writing in.
3150.02 3150.56 SPEAKER_04  I love you.
3150.78 3151.18 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3151.28 3153.24 SPEAKER_05  I mean, I still love doing this.
3153.30 3155.76 SPEAKER_05  It's so it's, it's, it's really, really enjoyable.
3155.92 3164.36 SPEAKER_05  It's, it's, I mean, I mean, this is still subject matter that, uh, that I'm fascinated by and I mean, it's just, it's just really cool that I get to continue to explore it.
3164.36 3170.12 SPEAKER_05  And, uh, you know, we're, we're thinking about, you know, the stuff that we're going to cover in this coming year, which, uh, which will definitely be interesting.
3170.12 3184.76 SPEAKER_05  But yeah, I'm, I'm very, very grateful that, um, that after all these years, ever since saying, you know, however long you've been listening that, you know, you're, there's still enough interest in, uh, the subject matter and the stuff we talk about that, uh, we can, you know, we can, we can, uh, do this full time.
3184.80 3185.40 SPEAKER_05  It's really great.
3185.62 3192.38 SPEAKER_04  And also thank you to our beautiful editor, Corey and Annie, Brad and Liv just absolute angels.
3192.38 3195.48 SPEAKER_04  And, uh, I know that they're also very grateful for all the listeners.
3195.48 3197.70 SPEAKER_04  So sending, just connecting that love.
3197.90 3211.24 SPEAKER_07  The way that the podcast has grown over the last, I don't know, seven years or so, however long it's been and how we, you know, have brought on new people and the show has evolved and devolved in some ways.
3211.24 3233.02 SPEAKER_07  And, um, working with so many other content creators and other podcasters and journalists, researchers, writers has just been so fucking cool to like, you know, get together with all of these really smart, wonderful people who are all also trying to make sense of why, why things have gotten so bad and in what ways.
3233.02 3241.46 SPEAKER_07  And it's just been, it's been really honestly, one of the joys of my life to, you know, make this show and keep making this show.
3241.82 3250.42 SPEAKER_07  And it's really funny that, you know, we, you know, the last four years have been under a liberal, you know, a liberal administration, quote unquote liberal.
3250.52 3253.38 SPEAKER_07  And there's still like too much content to cover.
3253.38 3263.16 SPEAKER_07  Like the idea that we are in a place that will never kind of be free from conspiratorial thinking and the, the prominence of extremism online.
3263.40 3267.56 SPEAKER_04  And also weird online sub communities and like fun esoteric stuff, you know?
3267.68 3267.90 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
3267.90 3273.38 SPEAKER_07  Finding like weird pilled communities, like weird sects of like a weird mod of a video game
3273.38 3276.26 SPEAKER_04  and all that stuff. By the way, we do have some stuff cooking for you this year.
3276.56 3282.98 SPEAKER_04  We can't reveal anything yet, but stay tuned for some interesting things that we have on the stove.
3283.28 3283.60 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
3283.94 3284.14 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
3284.16 3285.06 SPEAKER_07  We're not going anywhere.
3285.16 3288.18 SPEAKER_07  If anything, we're going to try to make like even, you know, even more content.
3288.56 3298.40 SPEAKER_07  And yeah, you know, that's all we can really promise is that we'll keep getting in front of these microphones and keep, keep writing scripts and saying stuff and talking about things.
3298.40 3300.20 SPEAKER_04  I'm very grateful for you, Jake.
3300.26 3301.20 SPEAKER_04  And for you, Travis.
3301.46 3301.90 SPEAKER_04  Thank you.
3301.98 3302.84 SPEAKER_04  We're grateful for you.
3302.84 3304.10 SPEAKER_05  Yes, absolutely.
3304.90 3322.98 SPEAKER_05  So one thing I, yeah, finally was like people, people have been asking me, it's like, if I'm ever going to write a book, I figure there's, there's like, cause I didn't quite, was never quite sure exactly what I was going to like, you know, write about, but I kept returning, especially, uh, I was always interested in these historical examples of like conspiracism and the, you know, the roots of American conspiracism.
3323.06 3332.44 SPEAKER_05  I just could return to this over and over again, especially I kept returning to the story of the, uh, the anti-Masonic party and the disappearance of William Morgan, which is subject matter.
3332.44 3336.50 SPEAKER_05  I just, you know, we've covered before on the podcast, but it's, I don't know, it's just really, really interesting.
3336.62 3339.44 SPEAKER_05  I kept researching more and more and more into this era.
3339.56 3350.00 SPEAKER_05  And it was so fascinating to me because I was like the fact that, you know, the people, the Americans of the 19th century, this is like, they were very, very obsessed with the kidnapping of William Morgan.
3350.00 3363.82 SPEAKER_05  It was the basically a, this, you know, a group of Masons in Batavia County, New York, that snatched him away or from a Genesee County, New York, uh, snatched him away from his home in Batavia because he was writing a book about the supposedly the secrets of Freemasons.
3363.98 3379.98 SPEAKER_05  And I know, and it was just something that like I said, the night, the people of the 19th century were obsessed with, like the, like the, um, the in Batavia, uh, the monument to William Morgan was erected in 1882, which was 56 years after he was kidnapped in 1826.
3379.98 3385.96 SPEAKER_05  So like most of the people involved in this is we're already dead, but still there's a little group of people obsessed with this thing.
3386.36 3398.64 SPEAKER_05  And, uh, I was researching it and it was really interesting because I feel like, I feel like when you really read deeply into it, there's like lots of elements of the story of William Morgan, which are not really, um, told in popular accounts.
3398.64 3408.86 SPEAKER_05  And like the anti-Masonic party is always, uh, sound like this weird, aberrant kind of like kooky kind of movement or an overreaction to a real incident or something like that.
3408.86 3417.64 SPEAKER_05  And when you really dive into it, hell no, it's really more significant and impactful on the culture, on American political culture than it's commonly thought.
3417.74 3438.48 SPEAKER_05  So like, I mean, the thing I'm, the, the, the, the broad thesis I'm kind of working with is the idea that how like the kidnapping, uh, of William Morgan and the anti-Masonic party kind of set up the, basically the tools and techniques of what we consider like the modern day political operative, particularly in this battle between Thurlow Weed, who was one of the leaders of the, uh, the anti-Masonic party and then the Whigs.
3438.54 3447.66 SPEAKER_05  And then he was also the Republican and also Van Buren, who was like the, one of the leaders, very first sort of like a political machine, what they call the Albany Regency in New York state.
3447.66 3451.38 SPEAKER_05  And there are always like little elements of the story that I just never, ever see.
3451.46 3453.78 SPEAKER_05  One of the things that was like, well, kept blowing me away.
3453.78 3459.32 SPEAKER_05  They never talk about very, very infrequently, at least in the most popular accounts of the William Morgan story.
3459.42 3465.44 SPEAKER_05  They never talk about this part of a Daniel Johns, the Canadian Masonic undercover spy.
3465.72 3472.60 SPEAKER_05  And there's this guy who, who traveled all the way from Canada after hearing that this book was being written and pretend to be an anti-Mason.
3472.60 3478.10 SPEAKER_05  And through this, uh, through this deceit infiltrated, uh, the office of David C.
3478.26 3479.70 SPEAKER_05  Miller, who was the guy who was printing it.
3479.70 3484.64 SPEAKER_05  And he even claimed he had 40 bucks that he could offer to put toward, towards the cause.
3484.64 3487.96 SPEAKER_05  And he slept in the office of this print shop with David C.
3488.02 3489.06 SPEAKER_05  Miller for two weeks.
3489.20 3492.28 SPEAKER_05  And at the end of it, he snatched one of the manuscripts and then made off.
3492.38 3496.86 SPEAKER_05  And allegedly this manuscript made it all the way to the, uh, New York Masonic lodge.
3496.86 3499.38 SPEAKER_05  The, like one of the main lodges in the, in the, in the state.
3499.56 3505.44 SPEAKER_05  And it's just like, it's just a crazier and more interesting story than, uh, I think a lot of people realize.
3505.44 3517.94 SPEAKER_05  So I'm trying to, I'm trying to shape something that, um, that, that really sort of like explains why it's actually much more significant and much more, much wilder than, uh, popular accounts, uh, say it is.
3518.20 3518.22 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3518.28 3521.64 SPEAKER_04  It does feel like a key historic moment to understand our period.
3521.64 3521.94 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, totally.
3521.94 3538.52 SPEAKER_04  And just to also to, to stop this, this kind of short-sighted idea that people have that we live in, in the age of conspiracy theories since like around 2016 or something, which is extremely funny because the, the founding of the country involves so much of it.
3538.52 3549.86 SPEAKER_04  Uh, and even, you know, previous to that, the revolution that, you know, inspired the American revolution, the French revolution was, uh, largely centered around, uh, a conspiracy theory as well.
3549.86 3557.30 SPEAKER_04  You know, that, uh, people were being held, uh, and tortured in the Bastille, which turned out not to be true, but it did, you know, change history.
3557.48 3560.52 SPEAKER_04  So I think it is, it is really worthy to, to, to connect those dots.
3560.64 3562.40 SPEAKER_04  I'm looking forward to, uh, to more of that.
3562.48 3568.34 SPEAKER_04  Is there anything that you want, like, you know, people to like flood your inbox about, or is there anything you're looking for?
3568.70 3572.88 SPEAKER_05  Um, no, I know what here's the, you know, I think, I think I've, I generally found everything.
3572.88 3579.02 SPEAKER_05  I know I was really interested because I started going on the hunt for like rare documents on this topic.
3579.02 3584.38 SPEAKER_05  Like for example, there was this, I kept reading references to this, uh, 1966 document.
3584.38 3589.26 SPEAKER_05  On the Morgan affair by Clarence O'lewis, who is this, uh, Niagara County historian.
3589.26 3590.82 SPEAKER_05  And it was sold nowhere.
3590.82 3592.56 SPEAKER_05  Like it was never commercially sold.
3592.72 3598.00 SPEAKER_05  There was this guy who researched the Morgan affair for decades and produced this typewritten account.
3598.00 3605.48 SPEAKER_05  And there was like, the only way to find it was like, I would have to travel all the way the fuck to, uh, Niagara County and like check it out in their special collections at the library.
3605.48 3611.78 SPEAKER_05  Then I found like one copy of it that was like sold on eBay and I got this like rare, like type printed document.
3611.78 3619.42 SPEAKER_05  And that's on a, it's a, uh, account of the Morgan affair that includes all these weird, wild details that aren't usually included elsewhere.
3619.78 3622.84 SPEAKER_04  For the listener, Travis is a waving documents at the camera.
3622.84 3624.00 SPEAKER_04  Like Alex Jones would.
3624.08 3624.34 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
3624.72 3626.40 SPEAKER_05  Well, it's like driving.
3626.52 3626.68 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
3626.68 3628.64 SPEAKER_05  It's like, it's like, it's like, it's like sometimes I'll like read something.
3628.66 3639.84 SPEAKER_05  It's like, what the hell is, and I'll be, I'll be forced to like go to, uh, for example, I've been really diving into, for example, scans of old New York state newspapers and I've been looking them everywhere.
3639.98 3646.96 SPEAKER_05  And I, by the way, the number one source for all scans of old newspapers is a website called Fulton history.com.
3647.04 3652.04 SPEAKER_05  For some reason they have the, this, there's this guy with has this rickety old website who has the best collection.
3652.04 3669.34 SPEAKER_05  But I've been reading like 1820s newspapers about, you know, about, about this incident about like, you know, the sort of wars because at the time there was like a, there were over 140 anti-Masonic newspapers and they were like pro with it called the, you know, the Albany Regency newspapers and just reading the, the way that they talk to each other.
3669.48 3672.88 SPEAKER_05  Whenever I was reading the secondary accounts, I kept running into questions.
3672.88 3674.60 SPEAKER_05  They're just, we're not being answered by them.
3674.64 3681.72 SPEAKER_05  So I had to like, keep diving into like, you know, the real deep primary stuff in order to like, get like the kind of understanding I was hoping to get.
3682.38 3683.12 SPEAKER_04  Sounds fascinating.
3683.36 3686.50 SPEAKER_04  And yeah, I can't wait to hear more and hear about your progress on that.
3686.70 3688.16 SPEAKER_04  I've also got some stuff going on.
3688.16 3689.02 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, Julian, what do you, yeah.
3689.06 3690.46 SPEAKER_07  Tell us about your passion projects.
3690.54 3692.76 SPEAKER_07  You might as well, since we're talking about all this stuff.
3692.90 3693.46 SPEAKER_04  DM me.
3693.46 3699.32 SPEAKER_04  I've been Xeroxing my butthole and I would be, I'll send you a copy of that if you want.
3699.48 3703.04 SPEAKER_04  It's like a, you know, an old Xerox machine and I just sit on it.
3703.06 3706.16 SPEAKER_04  And if you want to, to receive one of those, just DM me.
3706.20 3707.40 SPEAKER_04  Like I'm, I'm sending them out.
3707.52 3710.02 SPEAKER_04  Meshi's sending them a lot to like people who don't want them.
3710.44 3714.04 SPEAKER_07  He's trying to get them published in the final couple pages of Travis's book.
3714.20 3714.44 SPEAKER_07  I hear.
3714.56 3720.62 SPEAKER_04  I'm hoping to replace the entire New York Times with just page after page of my butthole.
3720.62 3720.96 SPEAKER_05  Right.
3721.06 3724.84 SPEAKER_05  Well, out of these copies, are they inkjet or laserjet?
3724.96 3726.96 SPEAKER_05  What kind of quality are we looking at here?
3726.96 3730.10 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, this is like old laserjet technology.
3730.24 3732.70 SPEAKER_04  Kind of faded, but it gives it a good patina.
3733.00 3733.74 SPEAKER_07  Smeared ink.
3733.94 3734.12 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
3734.28 3735.36 SPEAKER_07  Half cheek.
3735.62 3735.84 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3736.06 3737.94 SPEAKER_04  Each one is a unique copy.
3738.28 3741.50 SPEAKER_04  And especially if it's against your will, I would like to send you one.
3741.50 3748.56 SPEAKER_07  Meanwhile, I've finished recently my, I don't know, probably seventh or eighth full length screenplay.
3748.78 3751.10 SPEAKER_07  It's been a while since I've finished a whole movie.
3751.28 3752.90 SPEAKER_07  I finally, I finally finished one.
3753.06 3754.80 SPEAKER_07  We're going to try, I'm going to try to get it made.
3754.84 3756.82 SPEAKER_07  Although nobody's like making movies anymore.
3757.06 3757.84 SPEAKER_07  I've, I've, I've.
3757.98 3759.42 SPEAKER_03  They're no longer making movies.
3759.42 3761.96 SPEAKER_07  They're no longer doing movies and they're not doing TV.
3762.22 3766.64 SPEAKER_07  And a lot of people are talking about the TV shows are squid game, squid game only.
3766.64 3774.78 SPEAKER_07  But, uh, yeah, it's going to be, yeah, I, I've, I've passed it around to some of the, some of the usual suspects and they're like, man, they're like, the script is amazing.
3774.78 3777.04 SPEAKER_07  But like, people are trying to get into your business.
3777.06 3778.48 SPEAKER_07  Like they want to make podcasts.
3778.48 3783.50 SPEAKER_07  Like they don't like the fact that you, you have a podcast and you want to make a movie is absolutely insane.
3783.50 3784.24 SPEAKER_07  But you know what?
3784.26 3786.10 SPEAKER_07  We're going to still try and push it through.
3786.26 3787.54 SPEAKER_07  I think it's going to be really good.
3787.58 3792.60 SPEAKER_07  It has a lot to do with a lot of like, you know, what we, what we sort of study on this show.
3792.60 3799.30 SPEAKER_07  Um, there's some, there's some fun allegories to, to becoming radicalized online, but in the form of like a creature feature.
3799.52 3800.46 SPEAKER_07  So it should be good.
3800.60 3803.44 SPEAKER_04  The jokes aside, I do have, uh, three novels.
3803.64 3807.38 SPEAKER_04  If you're interested in reading some of the, the prose that I've written.
3807.56 3810.28 SPEAKER_04  Um, the first one's called even the red heron.
3810.28 3814.58 SPEAKER_04  The second one is called, and we came to find it beautiful.
3814.82 3818.80 SPEAKER_04  And the third one is the one that landed on zero books.
3818.80 3821.82 SPEAKER_04  And that one is called fire hides everywhere.
3822.26 3824.84 SPEAKER_04  So, you know, you can go check those out if you'd like.
3824.92 3826.96 SPEAKER_04  And if you don't, well, fuck you then.
3827.22 3828.68 SPEAKER_04  No, no, I love you.
3828.76 3831.34 SPEAKER_04  And, and why would you read when you have podcasts?
3831.46 3833.78 SPEAKER_04  No, I was saying, fuck you for writing three books.
3833.90 3834.56 SPEAKER_04  Oh, fuck me.

3877.78 3879.22 SPEAKER_04  So yeah, just sit tight.
3879.28 3886.80 SPEAKER_04  If that's the case, we are trying to solve this, but there's some, you know, Byzantine, uh, bureaucracy and also it was the, uh, holiday season.
3886.80 3890.74 SPEAKER_04  So everyone's, you know, kind of flailing around trying to get shit, uh, done.
3890.74 3890.82 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.

3920.72 3925.06 SPEAKER_07  So when it does kind of go and it does kind of happen, we actually feel really, really,
