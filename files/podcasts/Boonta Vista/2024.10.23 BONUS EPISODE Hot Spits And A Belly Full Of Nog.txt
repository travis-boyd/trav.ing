 Welcome to Buda Vista, it's a bonus episode. I'm Andrew, and I'm here in the intro that makes you old. My hair, already greying, is fast turning white. It's alarming, but I'm relieved that I apparently will never develop male pattern baldness. Next to me, I see my old, and now older, friend, who seems to be quickly developing some lower back issues. I can see his long balls drooping down from his ruggish shorts. I try to tell him, but he won't stop talking about how he wishes the band Sleep would play their darn music a little quieter. It's Ben! I just want to be able to talk throughout the whole set. Just to have a conversation, you know, is that so bad? I can't even hear what the bartender's asking me. I'd like that you threw yourself a little freebie. Oh, I've got a grave, I still have a beautiful head of hair. That's never going away. It's a good thing Louie isn't here, he would have got vaporized in like two minutes. Just turned to dust. It's very sad. Next to Ben is a woman propped up with a cane. You can tell she used to be beautiful, but the time has destroyed her like a runaway semi-trailer blasting through a sunglass hot kiosk. She just finished an insanely hot coffee and is now drinking a can of Woodstock that she says she prefers to Tempranillo. And she's ready to share her very recently formed opinions about immigrants. It's Lucy. It's just life after 30, am I right? Would the beach that makes you old give you the opinions of someone? I think it should. I think they naturally occur. Yeah, it makes you an annoying old person. Becoming racist is actually a biological part of aging. Yeah, we all start saying, oh, if you're not left wing when you're young, you've got no heart. But if you're not right wing when you're old, you've got no brain. We're all saying that to each other. So true. Standing and having a single beach. And we're laughing. Ha ha ha. That's very true and clever. Ow. We're saying. Looking to the distance, we see a figure cresting a hill. It's hard to see due to our deteriorating eyesight and glasses that now have out of day prescriptions, but I can just make him out. It's Theo and he just got here from the beach that makes you gay. Hi, Theo. Hey, guys. What's up? You came straight here from that? Yeah. Yeah. You think I should be making a stop somewhere? Is there anywhere else that he would have gone? Like he was insinuating. Add a different one to the itinerary. I should have come via the bathhouse. Yeah. Also, there's nothing kind of different about me, really, apart from that I'm gay. Yes. And you are getting older now. And I am also getting older and staying the same gay. Yes. And that was the safe version of the beach that makes you gay. Well done, everybody. Hey. You ever think about eggs? It's time. Yeah. All the time. For Big Egg. Big Egg. And small at the same time? Big Egg. Big Egg. Big. Big. Big Egg Big Egg Big Egg Big Egg Big Egg Big Egg Oh, big!

Old rusty gun found at Berwick High School Tuesday morning. Cool. Alright, not a problem then. It'd be very fun for the kids though. Dope item. You can probably turn that into a hands-on learning experience. Do some fucking archaeology on it or whatever. Point it at your mate. Pull the trigger. Oh! Imagine if I'm going to like shut you with a nards right now. Click, click. A gun was found at Berwick High School this morning but it was likely not left there recently authority said. That was fine. How does a gun Hmm? How does a gun remain undiscovered at a school? Yeah. Kids are always into shit. Kids love getting their hands on guns. Yeah. Always getting into stuff. According to a joint news release from the Berwick Police Department and the St. Mary Parish School System, maintenance workers conducting air conditioning work at Berwick High School found an old rusted firearm just before 11am today and immediately reported it to the school resource officer. Yeah, that's like means it was in the ducks, right? Yeah. That's someone that was someone's go gun. That was someone put it up there because they had a meeting with Selozzo or whatever and he's like I've hidden the gun up there you just get it halfway through the meeting so you need to go to the bathroom. No. Ask if you can go to the bathroom you get the gun you shoot him get out of there. Yeah. I think it's more like someone's got a meeting with their supervisor Yeah. They plant the gun up there if it's going badly you stand up excuse me I just need to check the vents for something real quick. How wet is it in the vents that your gun's rusting out? How fucking old are we talking? Does anyone know how wet vents I don't know what's going on up there down there. Sometimes those vents are wet. Is it a steam vent? Do they have those? Well not necessarily like completely the opposite right like because vents get cold they get condensation the vents at the hospital I used to work at bread legionnaire's disease in them Yeah they'll do that and then they had to evacuate the hospital So that needs some moisture Yeah so it gets wet in there Okay Wet vents Yeah Probably a wet vent Yeah they're gonna get wet I think something that's really powerful about this podcast that we all have such a broad life experience that we're kind of experts on like every topic Like on so many different topics Yeah Berwick police in conjunction with St Mary Parish school officials promptly responded and recovered the firearm I mean a police officer probably left it there so they had to get there quick before anyone worked it out Yeah before the cop like picked it up and then played with it and then like shot himself with it They showed up body slammed two kids shot the class gerbil Yeah and then got that gun out of there to keep him safe Investigators said the gun had been in place for quote a considerable amount of time and was covered with quote a significant amount of rust Also the old holster in which it was secured and the condition of its surroundings suggested the gun was not placed there recently What if the gun's older than school? I mean you said it was rusty Was this a cowboy? I guess you could have just been carrying a rusty gun Anyone can carry a rusty gun if they want to Recently placed but just it was a shitty old gun that sucks that this person had We can't all afford new guns Yeah true This has to be crime adjacent right? Maybe someone just didn't want to be too far from their gun you know but you're probably not allowed to open carry it Probably and you want to make sure that it's just sort of somewhere where you can get at it if you need You know where it is Just in case someone like kicks down the front door of the school with an AR-15 You've got a rusty gun You've always got your granddad's blunderbuss Granddad's blunderbuss Whip it out Yeah Oh my god I find my time Does anyone have a stepladder on them quick to get up into the vents This thing also takes black powder if you've got any on hand Stuff it in there The school has been here since 1975 Oh It probably wasn't a cowboy's gun I'm thinking now but it might have been like a Maybe like a midnight cowboy's gun or something Yeah probably a midnight cowboy's gun Probably a midnight cowboy's gun Yeah A little derringer Officials said the location of the discovery was not accessible to students or faculty at no time was anyone in danger and the school's operations continued without disruption So how the fuck did you get there? Who put it there? Where was it? Was it like a fucking chamber of secrets with a gun in it? It was completely inaccessible It arrived from Nadia Or It's just for the HVAC guy His dad left it there in 1979 He said Oh fuck I forgot Next time you're there I left my gun in the vents 40 years ago Could you get my gun? Hey son I murdered a competing HVAC specialist And I needed to stash it somewhere We're past the statute of limitations now so we can just get my piece that I left up there The firearm was collected by investigators to attempt to determine possible origin and or owner authorities said Really excited to find out who that is Hey guns in schools that seems to be a bit of a trend that we've seen throughout this podcast We look at other trends in Trendwatch This is from the Associated Press Eggnog before Thanksgiving? Shoppers eager for a new season Scramble retail calendars Wait I thought eggnog was a Christmas thing Yeah but now you can get eggnog before Thanksgiving? Eggnog before Thanksgiving? Okay Shoppers eager for a new season Scramble retail calendars Let's get Nog all year round Shoppers eager for a new season Scramble retail calendars After sipping pumpkin spice lattes in August and putting up Halloween decorations in late September Samantha Kowalczyk already looks forward to drinking eggnog flavoured coffee and filling her Wilmington Delaware home with cinnamon and sugar cookie scented candles and other holiday aromas I can't I can't I can't live in like this What is Why are they She's probably so much happier than all of us Oh my god Yeah so much Like She's got a calendar of things to look forward to Like Instagram to upwards of 40 people She's looking for like Pinterest fall ideas Pinterest fall decorations for home stuff and she is beaming She's so fucking happy She doesn't even feel like the month's just sort of stripped away from her life No She doesn't see this seasonal occurrence as like a clock counting down to her death She sees it as a gift that unfolds on an annual basis Yeah Which is psycho The 30 year old thinks seasonal flavours and scents should be available year round and apparently others feel the same way In response to growing customer demand stores of all stripes from Bath and Body Works and online holiday decor retailer Balsam Hill to Whole Foods Market and donut maker Krispy Kreme are bringing out their festive collections weeks before the November 1st start of the holiday shopping season Krispy Kreme's a fun one too because under no circumstances ever should anyone eat a donut from Krispy Kreme I love eating that bullshit You like Krispy Kreme that is so interesting I could sit and eat half a dozen of the original glaze Krispy Kreme guy Wow They got you I've got high cholesterol Big KK I don't know what cholesterol is in and I don't know how to avoid it I don't know if I have normal cholesterol I don't ever want to find out There's no space for me to worry about that I found out it's in all the foods I like I've deliberately not learned how many kilojoules are like good or bad same for calories I also don't know anything about like I've got learning about sodium I think we're done as a society with caring about sodium right are people still buying the low salt stuff no if you've got high blood pressure just don't get that and you look fantastic Ben so it just goes to show that there's probably something else going on the only thing you should worry about is what your body is telling you you want yeah yes and if you have allergies intuitive eating and drinking so if you feel like a beer that's your body's way of telling you that like it really wants a beer yes listen to your body's dreams yeah yes we started early on teaching our boys about like you know listening to their body and stuff and that's just an invitation for them to go my body is telling me that I need to eat chocolate yeah yeah they'll do that parenting doesn't work parenting is none of the things they say work it just doesn't work any of it they work for a while then you gotta switch it up I think parenting is just a thing that you do to make you feel better it's sort of like a useless busy work sort of like praying really it doesn't do anything but at least you feel like you're kind of you feel like you've done something you're putting some intention out into the world and maybe just maybe everything's gonna work out okay yeah scientists have actually proven that kids love to sit for six to eight hours at a time playing Astrobot it's actually the best thing for them I mean that's gives them the full spectrum of simulation you've been playing Astrobot with your boys which sounds very very cute that's very fucking wholesome yeah it's nice it's good not all gaming is evil just most of it just most of it just the vast vast majority of it the overwhelming majority yeah yeah all those woke games get them out of here yeah all those di chins in those video games whatever small titties chin all those awful high polygon titties there's this contingent that's like well the vast majority of gamers are men so why shouldn't everything be for daddy yes no you don't deserve anything you don't deserve why shouldn't everything be for daddy speaking as daddy yeah listen to your body you know yes this body what's see big jugs in my video game eggnog all year round big titty video games I don't ask for much all I ask for is non-DIE DEI chin boob physics yes upskirt what's DEI stand for again diversity equity and inclusion oh my god because she's got like a masculine chin yeah or she's just got like a normal face or whatever yeah okay all right yeah quote I want the season earlier and the things that go with the season earlier Kowalczyk said I want to enjoy it for as long as I can if I enjoy it why should I have to wait if I love nogging down if I love like I get home yeah big day big glass from the dental clinic where I work as a as a dental assistant as a dental assistant I'm stressed it was fucked in there that everyone's being a bitch right now and I just need my nog but I can't because it's fucking July and no one is selling my nog I live in Phoenix Arizona all of the saguaros are dying the tires of my car have melted I just want to nog down I don't think she knows what she's asking for the thing is once you can get nog all year round you don't care about it that's why it's so special because it's seasonal and if there are no seasons then everything is the same all the time is that what you want yes do you want to be robbed of the joy of that first sip of nog what was the thing she said that she craved specifically her eggnog flavoured coffee it's just probably like a Starbucks drink yeah yeah the new nog espresso yeah the nog espresso she needs her nog espresso I'm almost 100% certain in the extremely consumer oriented culture we now live in that like if you wanted to be drinking pumpkin spice lattes and fucking eggnog flavoured coffee and eating easter eggs all year round you could just jump on Amazon I think you can buy the syrup and stuff right yeah however many pumps you need they're always too many pumps they have in their drink they give you four pumps you've got to ask for less pumps can I have fewer pumps please something I've never asked ladies you can just go on Amazon right now and order yourself a bunch of easter eggs you can order yourself all kind of bullshit oh that's probably true isn't it you can probably just go online and get easter eggs can you get the Cadbury mini eggs which don't exist anymore because they took them away you can you can get Cadbury mini cream eggs is that what you're talking about no no the little speckled ones little speckled guys little candy shell they have the speckled egg M&M's this is what they took from you D.I. chin no mini eggs clothing food and home goods stores only too happy to push the season earlier to get shoppers to spend for a longer period of time are scrambling the traditional retail calendar in the process and this year with Thanksgiving Day falling on November 28th and leaving five fewer days before Christmas compared with last year that pressure to get shoppers to buy is even more intense analysts say members of Bath and Body Works's loyalty program could shop a holiday preview collection of candles in scents like winter candy apple and bright Christmas morning starting September 24th they got the early candles they got a sneak peek at the candle stock you're getting your bright Christmas morning candles on September 24th that's right I got winter wonderland body wash in my shower right now Bath and Body works winter wonderland body wash get that on sale you know it's a bargain if you buy it's a smart purchase for everyone else it became available on September 30th last year customers in the rewards program didn't get access to those products until October 3rd and the holiday themed merchandise didn't launch in stores until October 9th I am just completely unaware of any of this none of this is reality to me this is a whole other world I envy a little bit how much some Americans in like the states where there's weather and stuff like they seem to cherish like leaning into winter the coming of fall and winter all this cozy nonsense oh the smell of fresh ginger cookies coming from the oven I'm wearing an orange and ochre sweater of some kind and I have the candles that are the pumpkin spice candles are lit you can do that there because their houses are insulated so winter is like cozy I don't live in the town from Gilmore Girls yes but if I did I'd make it my fucking business to ruin their lives I'd take a gun to the gazebo I'd walk right up to them and I'd say shut up shut up for one goddamn slow down can't get a word in edgewise here what's with the quips stop quipping and just talk to me person to person you're just talking past each other whole foods brought out autumnal items like pumpkin spice pancake and waffle mix apple pear ginger italian soda and pumpkin spice ground coffee in the first two weeks of september a year ago it was in the last two weeks of the month starbucks introduced its full menu august august august 22 to august 22 including an iced apple crisp non-dairy cream chai two days earlier than last year what are you fucking people doing what you're just pumping out all this dumb shit because the leaves are changing yeah they got a whole thing there about fall yeah kind of not a thing here retailers are expanding seasonal flavors and scents to more areas of the store too especially the now ubiquitous pumpkin spice trash bag brand hefty owned by reynolds consumer products introduced cinnamon pumpkin spice scented bags on september 27th oh they sell they sell trash bags it's not just an epithet yeah your bags fucking suck so they started selling this as a marketing gimmick like a joke product in 2022 but it sold out in seconds each year it's been offered earlier to keep up with consumer demand said brian lutz marketing director of hefty waste this is a stupid piece of shit that no one will buy yeah turns out yeah people love dumb shit retailers said that the shoppers interest in jumpstarting seasons sooner began before the coronavirus pandemic they want their fall trends their holiday goods yeah they've got nothing to live for quote decorating brings joy and reduces stress they're just decorating earlier because it's freaking stressful right now harman citing war in the middle east hurricanes and political division among other crises what there's just so much going on what yeah that's why people are doing this you know because i am so much closer to samsara than i don't know i just this is a this is a hell of your own making yeah surely for retailers moving to the next holiday while overlapping other holidays is an opportunity to pick up extra sales said marshall cohen chief industry advisor of market research firm sir carna hey retailers there's something more to life than sales yeah it's called friendship yes what if what if there was a christmas miracle and because of a freak uh lightning storm or you switched bodies with a poor person huh would you think that christmas was about products then yeah think about that what if there was a global catastrophe that brought all the banks down yes then what yeah then christmas would have to be about coming together yeah what if someone what if someone what if someone did something what if someone did something really fucking big what if someone took out every single person on the designated survivor list plus all the other guys in one sweeping move what if someone what if someone out that did something yeah what if someone actually made it fucking happen instead of just talking about it but there are plenty of shoppers like jamie burkle 33 from awayga new york who wants to stick to buying seasonal items time to the calendar quote i feel like there is a time and season for everything she says yes yes talking some sense at last a harvest moon you know a spring crop a fertility season you know what i you know what i don't want to hear someone say i don't want to hear someone say tis the season and it's august that's not the season i think it's kind of fucked that americans kind of drag the idea of a holiday season like right back to november because they're lumping thanksgiving in there as well and if you're including thanksgiving you may as well put fucking halloween in there and then all of a sudden like a quarter of your year is fucking the holiday season hey if you love holidays so much why don't you take some personal leave yeah oh i bet you guys guaranteed that guaranteed personal leave from your thing fucking doing whatever hey you know yeah four weeks paid vacation time idiots here's a little tip for the retailers though uh just change the text on your products to say tis a season yes yeah and then you know just stock that shit all year round yeah it's a season and you've got like some holly and some bells on there and a jack-o-lantern and some chocolate eggs uh what else do we need to account for here uh some streamers and stuff like it's new years i did trim apart from this article that mentioned st patrick's day products as well oh yeah we'll get that on there too because you know you need those get a couple of four-leaf clovers and a passed out irish guy on your napkin yes you know just kind of cover all the bases a passed out irish american guy you know boston that sort of yeah yeah that's what i'm making uh quote if we purchase these things too early they're not as special yes jamie correct everything in moderation yeah plus it's only special if you attach that meaning to it yes which i don't true of all things yeah really the only meaning objects have is that with which we imbue them i think you can take that to the bank yes the bank of ideas hey this has been a very regional observation of some american customs we look at

tired of hearing the news don't you want to make the news what if you were the news because you did something what if you did something are you tired of hearing the news isn't it time to smell the news that's right taste the news reed's dairy will provide the egg dog for this year's event then miller expressed his gratitude to them quote they've had a tough year after the fire but they've agreed to come back out and donate all the egg nog we really really appreciate that it's a beautiful storytelling very sorry to hear about the fire down at reed's dairy but they the boys what if you whip up a bunch of brews so a whole ton of folks could spew it up what if we made an egg dog so good it saved the town miller added that the city is partnered with the community food basket of idaho falls and eastern idaho community action partnership quote if you bring an item of food brackets non-perishable or a cold weather item of clothing or a toy to donate needers will give you a free french toast card that's for runners and spectators anybody coming out that's fucking awesome actually go and donate to the food bank and then get a free french toast card from needers the nogathon is coming back this year because the first year was so successful miller told eastidahonews.com that since it was a new event last year they expected about 50 people instead over 100 people came out quote we had about 175 show up to run we were blown away by the attendance last year so this year we're hoping for 200 more that's good lord 175 people at the same time on a 400 meter track with a belly full of nog that's just a it can't have been free from sloppiness trouble brewing yeah in 175 people's guts it's possible to get sick during the race due to the amount of eggnog consumed i feel like that's the point maybe he said there will be strategically placed trash cans around the course you can't put on an event that plans for vomiting like if vomiting is a consequence of the thing you're putting on don't put on the thing am i a prude i think you're a prude if you haven't tried the nogathon or if you want to return miller encourages it quote you got a cool story to tell he said we encourage everybody to come dressed in fun holiday costumes what's the story what holiday halloween i guess season because you know this is the sort of thing that i try and look up for this i really wanted to find out how drippy that shirt was because i was like i think i i would really like to cop a nogathon shirt so i tried to see if they posted any pictures of it i couldn't find it anywhere not even of last year's shirt but what i did find was this isn't the first nogathon in america there was actually another nogathon uh that for 11 years ran in beautiful mesa arizona mesa mesa arizona arizona shit uh beautiful mesa arizona uh this was on december the last one was on december 17th 2016 this was the 11th and final nogathon now this one was slightly different they had a slightly different format they also had a tagline for their event which i really like the tagline is you'll know when you're finished which seems to me to sort of yeah you know suggests a slightly different tone of the event this is how they describe the rules bullet point form here first point run as many laps as you can drink non-alcoholic egg nog each lap now this was uh same same amount weirdly it's a pot of nog for each lap and it's also a quarter mile lap so exactly the same except for one same format one crucial change here win so there is a winner in this one run the most laps before throwing up so they're saying it's kind of guaranteed that you're going to puke well i guess because the egg nog just continues getting input into your body and yeah it's more of a it's more of a um the running and puking man yes and surely by the end of like the better you go the worse the outcome at the end right well can you imagine you've done like if you've done eight laps you've had two liters of egg nog and you've been running so do they have the records there no they don't fucking say they don't say how many laps the winner did and let alone who the winner was they don't post any photos of the event they don't post any photos of the winner or anything which makes me believe it must be disgusting by the ending you know you got a guy that does like half marathons recreationally who's done like 20 laps of the nogathon he's had like 20 pots of nog they have to budget in re-turfing the entire course once they're done all the bile's so acidic oh man they're not they're not the only place to and the nogathon oh wait you were talking about Mesa Arizona right i can find their shirt yes it's not a great shirt that one's as drippy as i hoped and if you look at the photos from the article that you're talking about ben there is an article there is a photo with last year's event and lots of people are wearing identical shirts and as far as i can make out they're not great they have a bunch of sponsors on the back and then the top seems to say like 2023 amon nogathon in a very nondescript font then underneath it just has a picture of a cup and it says one mile 32 ounces i live my life one mile and 32 ounces at a time fucking amon nogathon sounds like what the like secret name for hellboy is there is a there is a horrifying photo attached to that article which has like the trestle tables all set up with styrofoam cups or plastic cups of eggnog ready to go but set up like you know when you see a marathon and people run past and they grab the cup of water yeah you're getting real hot like throwing a nice cup of cold nog over your head to cool off man like i know they're doing this in winter but i mean this is arizona that sun is still out that nog's warming up for sure the crisp arizona sun hitting your nog chugging down you're like you're you're covered in sweat you've already got half an ounce you already got half an ounce of a nog in you you run past you pick up a cup of nog it started to turn lukewarm and you don't realize until it's going down that there was like a drowning fly just below the surface spitting your mouth's turning warm this is getting the hot spits with a belly full of nog i got the hot spits i got a belly full of nog and i got shin splints but hey it's for charity doing it out of love fuck that's got to be a really disgusting time that's so nasty i just hate that someone is like you can't have vomiting in the rules of a charity event this just seems crazy to me like yeah yep yeah hey this was definitely an episode of the podcast bunta vista uh thank you we're sorry so much for joining us apologize if you've got a a weak stomach or you you drink a lot of nog all throughout the year and you hate to hear it disparaged like this um thank you so much for supporting us and supporting the patreon um it's a pretty pretty good model for us you give us money and then that money sort of acts as a form of income though the we then use to buy goods and services um and we don't give any money to uh there's no advertising guys or anything so yeah thank you because fuck those suits no suits involved unless i go to a wedding and even then it's sort of like an informal yeah sort of it's even then it's got a bolo tie bolo tie because that's it's like i'm making an effort but i look stupid wearing a normal suit ironically yeah i look like a fucking idiot i look like those uh those promo photos from when joaquin phoenix did that thing where he pretended to quit acting to do a a rap gig and his hair looked crazy yeah he was wearing that suit i'm not here yeah yeah you would never really hear that one uh we will see you on the free episode and then hopefully again on a bonus episode and sort of repeating that um until we die or you do yeah yeah until then stay safe bye goodbye bye you
