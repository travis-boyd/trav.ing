0.00 16.02 SPEAKER_01  Hello and welcome to a bonus episode?
16.02 17.16 SPEAKER_01  No, it's the free one.
17.88 18.78 SPEAKER_01  It's the free one.
18.84 22.16 SPEAKER_01  Hello and welcome to a free episode of Trash Future.
22.80 23.96 SPEAKER_00  It's Alex, my love, and Hussain.
23.96 29.16 SPEAKER_00  You're grateful compared to Riley because I actually am helping by reminding you that
29.16 36.64 SPEAKER_01  it's the free one. You're assisting me because our fearlessly the Riley is away and me, you know, I'm not the step host.
36.80 38.18 SPEAKER_01  I'm just the host that stepped up.
38.36 38.78 SPEAKER_01  Correct.
39.18 40.50 SPEAKER_01  I've written a little episode.
40.78 42.72 SPEAKER_01  And to be honest, this one's kind of all dessert.
43.54 43.90 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
44.22 48.74 SPEAKER_01  You know, Riley, Riley, he likes to make us talk about sort of like financial instruments and stuff.
48.90 52.88 SPEAKER_01  Whereas what I've done is I found some real like clown shoes.
52.98 53.16 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
53.16 53.48 SPEAKER_01  Shit.
54.42 56.76 SPEAKER_01  And I hope you're excited to join me.
56.76 59.24 SPEAKER_01  We're here with our indulgent stepmother, Alice.
60.10 62.20 SPEAKER_01  Not to be confused with our wicked stepmother.
62.76 66.76 SPEAKER_01  Your fun stepmother, your fun aunt, you know, starting to wear like...
66.76 73.80 SPEAKER_02  We were like the sort of recently divorced father who's like desperately wanting to make his kids like, you know, desperately wanting to make the kids the favorite.
74.06 75.70 SPEAKER_02  So it's just like treats all the way up.
75.70 76.18 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
76.18 76.26 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
76.34 76.52 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
76.52 76.64 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
76.64 78.72 SPEAKER_01  I'm trying to like bond with you and connect with you.
78.80 81.40 SPEAKER_01  I'm trying to be like, is it called an EVA?
81.66 82.76 SPEAKER_01  Is that what you like?
82.96 93.14 SPEAKER_02  And then when Riley comes back, like you'll get into an argument because you like, because it's like, no, they have to, they have to, the children have to eat their vegetables and the vegetables are financial reports for some reason.
93.14 93.62 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
93.62 93.70 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
93.70 93.90 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
93.90 94.14 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
94.14 94.16 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
94.16 94.26 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
94.26 101.08 SPEAKER_01  The, the, the, this fight that I have with Riley sort of, uh, this time next week is like, why do I always have to be the bad guy host?
101.32 107.60 SPEAKER_01  You know, why do I have to be the one who like, you know, makes them learn about the IMF?
108.46 110.84 SPEAKER_01  But no, we, we got some fun stuff.
111.06 113.12 SPEAKER_01  First of all, little piece of news.
113.58 118.92 SPEAKER_01  You may have heard about this after having killed 15 trillion lab animals.
118.92 123.04 SPEAKER_01  Elon Musk has finally put Neuralink in a person.
123.84 125.46 SPEAKER_01  It's in a person's head now.
125.92 128.72 SPEAKER_00  Well, that's how he warmed himself up for creating Neuralink.
128.82 131.52 SPEAKER_00  You got to kill a bunch of lab animals just to get in the zone.
131.70 132.54 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, exactly.
132.76 135.06 SPEAKER_01  And I mean, if you're that first person, right.
135.08 138.98 SPEAKER_01  And you go, what kind of preparation did you do for this before you put it in my head?
139.32 140.36 SPEAKER_01  How worried should I be?
140.66 142.10 SPEAKER_01  They can be like, don't worry.
142.16 144.60 SPEAKER_01  We killed millions of pigs.
144.94 153.60 SPEAKER_01  So we're pretty certain this is going to be, you know, like, safe for you because you're like mostly sort of like pig physiology when you get right
153.60 154.12 SPEAKER_00  down to it.
154.18 156.34 SPEAKER_01  Brain's very similar. Don't worry about it.
156.54 157.42 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, exactly.
157.52 159.98 SPEAKER_00  A pig will look you in the eye and respect you as an equal.
160.26 161.14 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, exactly.
161.66 168.38 SPEAKER_01  And so now Elon Musk has put the Neuralink thing, the neural implant in a person.
168.38 176.96 SPEAKER_01  And what you can do with it, he says, is control your phone or computer by thinking, right?
177.00 180.48 SPEAKER_01  He calls it the telepathy app, which, right.
180.60 180.94 SPEAKER_01  Okay.
181.00 186.54 SPEAKER_01  It's not like a huge, like, I wouldn't get my head cracked open to get this put in.
186.54 196.52 SPEAKER_01  But the sort of the pitch that he's making is, you know, we're going to use it for people with like sort of like really debilitating disabilities or like missing limbs or whatever.
196.72 198.70 SPEAKER_01  So they can go on the phone too.
199.48 202.72 SPEAKER_00  Really debilitating disabilities, such as being a white South African.
204.32 206.32 SPEAKER_00  We're hoping to find a cure.
206.32 215.04 SPEAKER_01  Doing the like Christopher Reeve, like a sort of edited advert where Elon Musk comes out talking normal.
215.82 215.96 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
217.84 219.46 SPEAKER_01  Hello, I'm Elon Musk.
220.02 221.96 SPEAKER_01  Together, together we can make this real.
222.24 235.36 SPEAKER_01  But no, we get a sense of exactly what kind of disabilities Elon means because with his sort of trademark subtlety, he said, imagine if Stephen Hawking could communicate faster than a speed typist or auctioneer.
235.36 236.74 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, that's the goal.
240.58 243.40 SPEAKER_00  I love that those are the two things they've chosen.
244.08 246.50 SPEAKER_00  A speed typist or auctioneer.
246.86 247.50 SPEAKER_00  Why not both?
247.72 250.48 SPEAKER_00  But Stephen Hawking auctioneer is a fun sitcom.
251.84 255.48 SPEAKER_01  Just doing theoretical physics, but like really quickly.
255.98 256.42 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
256.66 262.14 SPEAKER_00  Like what if the Epstein Island stuff had come out earlier and he'd had to quit physics and had a second career?
262.14 267.28 SPEAKER_00  You know, where's his like Joey spin-off where he's like trying to be a small town auctioneer?
269.36 269.80 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
270.20 274.00 SPEAKER_01  This is the other strange thing is that Elon Musk said this like yesterday, right?
274.06 280.86 SPEAKER_01  So it's like after all of the, you know, revelations about the private island and so forth have come out about Stephen Hawking.
280.86 283.14 SPEAKER_01  It's a weird choice.
283.24 288.10 SPEAKER_01  Like apparently he just hasn't checked in on the guy lately and it's just like Stephen Hawking.
288.18 289.10 SPEAKER_01  Everyone loves him.
289.36 291.36 SPEAKER_01  You know, what if he was faster?
292.96 295.92 SPEAKER_01  Which I don't know.
296.04 300.86 SPEAKER_01  Now I'm sort of less secure about creating some kind of like science enabled turbonauts.
300.86 301.86 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
303.86 304.34 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
304.34 305.66 SPEAKER_01  That is potentially an issue.
306.28 308.28 SPEAKER_00  We've, yeah, we've speeded up the wheelchair.
310.84 313.20 SPEAKER_00  Make him all the more able to catch children.
313.36 314.44 SPEAKER_00  This is the one thing.
315.24 317.96 SPEAKER_00  The one thing we did not want to happen.
318.02 318.20 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
318.34 318.70 SPEAKER_00  Unfortunately.
318.70 321.90 SPEAKER_01  But so this is the thing, right?
322.64 332.18 SPEAKER_01  Everyone's sort of making their jokes about how the person that this brain implant has been put in is gonna, you know, their head's gonna explode like scanners, right?
332.52 333.88 SPEAKER_01  And it's an Elon Musk product.
334.00 335.34 SPEAKER_01  So that's a very real possibility.
335.34 341.38 SPEAKER_01  But to me, this strikes me as like the early Teslas where like he didn't develop this.
341.48 346.42 SPEAKER_01  He's meddled with it a bit, but he's just like bought his way into this company that already existed.
346.76 347.22 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
347.34 348.16 SPEAKER_01  That makes sense.
348.16 360.28 SPEAKER_01  What concerns me, and the reason why I wouldn't get this put in my head, is there's still a lot of ways for Elon Musk to like fuck up all of your shit, even with a product that works.
360.38 362.66 SPEAKER_01  I mean, that's what SpaceX has been, right?
362.66 366.74 SPEAKER_01  The rockets kind of work until Elon Musk makes them not.
366.74 382.56 SPEAKER_01  And in particular, now there is a human being who has like an implant in their head, the function of which is tied to not so much like whatever Elon Musk is doing, but like it's tied to like Elon Musk's marketing needs.
382.56 392.24 SPEAKER_01  And so, you know, in the same way that SpaceX, they're like, oh, we'll just launch this one rocket without the shields that stop it from like melting everybody's cars in like a three mile radius or whatever.
392.24 407.00 SPEAKER_01  Now, the sort of like rollout and the use of this technology inside this person's head, which is going to be in more people's heads, is tied to the kind of whims of this like impulsive, greedy, lying, stupid dickhead, which sounds great.
407.00 408.86 SPEAKER_00  What do you really think, Alice?
409.10 412.46 SPEAKER_01  I think, I think maybe I don't need to go on my phone that badly.
412.68 413.24 SPEAKER_01  That's a lie.
413.30 414.72 SPEAKER_01  I do need to go on my phone that badly.
415.90 420.42 SPEAKER_00  I got the Elon Musk Neuralink and now I have this insatiable urge to run over a child.
420.84 425.42 SPEAKER_00  Just like Naruto running towards a school gate in the hope of taking out as many as possible.
425.42 433.90 SPEAKER_02  This sounds horrifying to the extent, but like, well, if, if, if the only thing that the Neuralink really does is sort of kind of let you deal with your phone and do posts.
433.90 443.26 SPEAKER_02  But it's also just like, well, I mean, the thing that I sort of hate, like, you know, you know, the thing that I hate about technology, but like, wouldn't you just, wouldn't you just be tormented by notifications?
443.98 445.48 SPEAKER_01  I basically am already.
445.48 456.36 SPEAKER_02  Like this guy, this guy is going to kill himself because like all he's going to see and all like every time he gets a notification, like his brain is going to just get an impulse, right?
456.64 457.00 SPEAKER_02  Probably.
457.38 462.96 SPEAKER_02  And I imagine because of Elon Musk, like there is no way to actually turn off the button that says I don't get notifications.
462.96 469.78 SPEAKER_02  Or if there is one, then he's fired the people who can do that because they're woke.
470.14 471.64 SPEAKER_02  And so this guy is going to die.
471.82 478.02 SPEAKER_01  He's doing the like Twitter thing where it like forces you to follow Mr. Beast because he's trying to like red pill Mr. Beast.
478.22 478.30 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
478.44 483.26 SPEAKER_01  And so now every time Mr. Beast posts, this guy gets like a brain zap or something.
484.32 487.64 SPEAKER_00  The Mr. Beast brain implant that makes you do that weird smile.
487.64 491.30 SPEAKER_02  Or he's just like tormented by those weird Twitter ads that like don't make any sense.
491.40 496.80 SPEAKER_02  And like, you know, are mostly just guys like really pining for their ex-wives for some reason.
496.90 498.00 SPEAKER_02  Like they're not even selling anything.
498.14 502.76 SPEAKER_02  They're just like, but it's like my wife used to hate this suit, but now that I'm free from her, I can wear it.
503.12 509.08 SPEAKER_02  Which I like, I saw something basically along those lines like a few days ago, but there's going to be no way to turn them off.
509.08 519.84 SPEAKER_02  And so this guy, like whoever's got this Neuralink is going to like either be killed by the amount of sort of like electrical impulses that his brain now has to deal with.
519.96 529.30 SPEAKER_02  Or is going to kill themselves because they cannot get away from like the fact that the internet and just being online is so shit.
529.72 529.84 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
529.96 534.42 SPEAKER_01  I mean, imagine that you have like, you know, God forbid you have something like locked in syndrome, right?
534.42 539.20 SPEAKER_01  You're just like, and you have to like exist without being able to like move any of your body at all.
539.94 542.24 SPEAKER_01  And Elon Musk is like, Hey, I can improve this.
542.56 545.28 SPEAKER_01  You can use X the everything app now.
546.16 549.36 SPEAKER_01  You can, you can check out what's going on on there.
549.76 564.00 SPEAKER_01  And I mentioned, I mentioned this second bit purely to annoy Riley, but we know that Elon Musk has this kind of thing where people will reply to him on Twitter and on the spur of the moment, he'll just lie.
564.00 564.60 SPEAKER_01  Right.
565.08 575.58 SPEAKER_01  Was someone like some, some blue tick was like, Hey, Elon, why don't you, have you considered using this to restore sight to blind people?
576.04 584.00 SPEAKER_01  Um, and Elon, of course, is like, I have already thought of this most obvious live ever voice.
584.00 588.68 SPEAKER_01  It's going to be called blind sight after a book.
588.96 593.72 SPEAKER_01  I don't believe that he understands, but which is Riley's favorite book.
594.02 595.68 SPEAKER_01  We did a left on read about it.
595.72 596.90 SPEAKER_01  That's going to be coming out soon.
596.98 597.76 SPEAKER_01  You can listen to that.
598.16 598.30 SPEAKER_01  Okay.
598.30 600.46 SPEAKER_01  It's going to give you the chip that turns you into a vampire.
601.08 601.48 SPEAKER_01  Exactly.
601.66 601.88 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
601.88 609.20 SPEAKER_01  Like, it's just, it's such a fucking, uh, like poser sci-fi thing to do.
609.26 609.42 SPEAKER_01  Right.
609.48 611.94 SPEAKER_01  It's the same with like all of the culture references and stuff.
612.30 621.54 SPEAKER_01  Um, and in particular, it's really funny to me to, to name something, to give a blind person's sight, blind sight, the opposite of what that is.
622.02 626.60 SPEAKER_01  Um, because, because of blind sight, I assume that's a thing that's good, right?
626.60 629.36 SPEAKER_01  It's when you can see instead of, instead of the opposite of that.
629.36 631.34 SPEAKER_00  It's when you were blind, but now you see.
632.02 634.54 SPEAKER_00  So, um, much, much to consider here.
634.88 638.02 SPEAKER_00  The novelization of Amazing Grace, blind sight.
638.84 644.68 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, we've, we've accidentally gotten Elon Musk into the different kind of novels and he's like, you know, got little women up there now.
645.08 645.68 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
645.94 648.52 SPEAKER_00  He's, he's, he's started going to like a gospel church.
649.78 653.52 SPEAKER_00  That would, that would, now that would be a cursed Elon Musk trajectory.
653.52 656.20 SPEAKER_00  Elon is way too racist to do that.
656.20 661.18 SPEAKER_00  Not because there's anything wrong with gospel churches, but just Elon Musk specifically attending one.
661.78 662.58 SPEAKER_00  It would get weird.
662.92 664.90 SPEAKER_01  It's, I mean, frankly, he's already weird.
665.06 669.52 SPEAKER_01  And it's going to get so much weirder because this is like, you know, the first of many.
669.64 671.34 SPEAKER_01  They're going to keep putting these into people.
671.34 679.36 SPEAKER_01  And one of the things about, uh, implanting stuff in humans is that you can't ever have it be obsolete.
680.14 687.30 SPEAKER_01  There was this thing, speaking of blind sight, there was this thing that happened where a bunch of people had their sight restored by like artificial eyes.
687.80 693.58 SPEAKER_01  And then the company that was making them went out of business and they couldn't maintain them anymore.
693.58 696.42 SPEAKER_01  And all of those people lost their sight again.
696.84 697.34 SPEAKER_00  Now, I mean.
697.68 703.26 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, that is, that is honestly, it's like Cory Doctorow levels of like, I can't believe that happened in real life.
703.30 704.76 SPEAKER_00  But yeah, I remember hearing about that as well.
704.80 705.48 SPEAKER_00  That's fucking mental.
705.54 711.04 SPEAKER_01  So tying that to the business acumen and like survivability of Elon Musk.
711.48 712.84 SPEAKER_01  And it's, it's not even your eyes.
712.92 713.84 SPEAKER_01  It's your brain.
714.30 716.34 SPEAKER_00  My brain subscription ran out.
716.76 719.48 SPEAKER_00  It like, it's like throttling your brain power.
719.48 726.58 SPEAKER_00  Like you suddenly like, you just, you like, you can still basically live like you, you function, but you just get really into Love Island.
726.74 728.52 SPEAKER_00  You're like, oh, this is what it's like.
729.38 732.96 SPEAKER_00  This is what it's like to care about, you know, Casey from Cheshire.
734.10 736.38 SPEAKER_01  Getting the likes of social media lobotomy.
736.60 736.80 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
737.42 737.74 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
737.84 738.00 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
738.00 738.18 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
738.18 738.98 SPEAKER_00  So that's Neuralink.
739.14 741.10 SPEAKER_00  I understand Bevo now.
742.88 745.58 SPEAKER_00  I too want to swallow things whole like a snake.
746.70 747.64 SPEAKER_00  Maybe that's good.
747.74 749.38 SPEAKER_00  Maybe, maybe actually it's a positive thing.
749.38 751.60 SPEAKER_00  We should let Elon Musk lobotomize all of us.
751.78 757.38 SPEAKER_00  Maybe it would actually be a purer, like this podcast could become like mom's basement or the Joe Rogan experience.
758.06 758.56 SPEAKER_01  Could be cool.
758.80 761.62 SPEAKER_00  You know, we wouldn't have to stress so much about things.
762.44 762.66 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
762.90 765.74 SPEAKER_00  Riley comes back and he's like, oh, what do you think about the brain chip?
765.96 766.08 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
766.08 766.74 SPEAKER_00  I think it's going to be awesome.
766.84 766.92 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
766.96 767.44 SPEAKER_00  Pull that up.
767.48 767.56 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
767.56 767.98 SPEAKER_00  I get this.
768.16 768.50 SPEAKER_00  Don't worry.
768.50 768.80 SPEAKER_00  Brain.
769.16 770.72 SPEAKER_00  I want to become, I want to get a chimp brain.
771.20 771.90 SPEAKER_01  This is Riley.
772.04 773.34 SPEAKER_01  Riley on vacation.
773.52 776.38 SPEAKER_01  Having been sort of like indoctrinated into Neuralink.
776.38 776.90 SPEAKER_01  Neuralink.
777.06 779.42 SPEAKER_01  It's just like ready to red pill the rest of us.
779.54 779.68 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
780.18 785.38 SPEAKER_00  Riley gets like bonked over the head by like a very expensive bottle of claret in Gloucester's.
786.18 790.14 SPEAKER_00  And then he accidentally gets the Elon Musk surgery.
790.14 799.50 SPEAKER_01  But, but so that's, that's Neuralink and we'll see how that develops, whether someone's like head explodes like in scanners or whether it's just one of those things that Elon fucks up a bunch more.
799.86 801.58 SPEAKER_01  A chilling portent of things to come.
802.30 803.32 SPEAKER_01  Just as a quick hit.
804.10 806.88 SPEAKER_01  We remember George Osborne, friend of the show.
806.88 807.06 SPEAKER_00  Oh, we do.
807.32 809.56 SPEAKER_01  Place of this parish, former chancellor of the Exchequer.
810.10 813.42 SPEAKER_01  Guy with a bunch of weird jobs as well.
813.84 814.02 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
814.12 816.02 SPEAKER_00  We're doing, we're doing Justin Lee Collins shit.
816.12 816.80 SPEAKER_00  Where is he now?
817.00 821.10 SPEAKER_00  We're going to get him, Cameron fucking, you know.
821.22 829.66 SPEAKER_01  Cameron having a weird kind of resurgence, you know, but George Osborne, he's, he's sort of like, he's the member of the band that like Justin Lee Collins has a bit more difficulty finding.
830.48 835.68 SPEAKER_00  Inviting like him, Cameron and Nick Clegg to a village hall, but not telling the others that they're going to be there.
835.88 837.80 SPEAKER_00  And then just them all turning off and being like, oh my God.
837.80 838.48 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
838.74 843.28 SPEAKER_01  So, so he has a new job after the British Museum and the Evening Standard.
843.80 847.10 SPEAKER_01  He has been asked to join Coinbase.
847.80 848.80 SPEAKER_01  The, uh, like.
849.22 850.80 SPEAKER_01  This is very Nick Clegg coded actually.
851.06 851.18 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
851.24 851.54 SPEAKER_01  Right.
851.60 853.98 SPEAKER_01  But like at least Nick Clegg got Facebook.
853.98 867.46 SPEAKER_01  Whereas George Osborne is stuck on the global advisory council of the sort of crypto thing that tries to let you buy a croissant with crypto and it takes like five minutes.
868.40 868.92 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
869.00 869.40 SPEAKER_01  Who wouldn't?
869.74 872.54 SPEAKER_01  It just seems so outdated.
872.98 878.06 SPEAKER_01  You know, we stopped talking about Coinbase a while ago because there wasn't much else going on there.
878.14 882.76 SPEAKER_01  Like crypto was kind of done and washed, but it doesn't matter.
882.76 884.48 SPEAKER_01  There's, you know, they're still lobbying.
884.72 889.46 SPEAKER_01  They still have money and they're still doing the same shit of like, please regulate us.
889.56 892.24 SPEAKER_01  Please make us in charge of what the regulations look like.
892.34 905.32 SPEAKER_02  I mean, also it's, it's, it's really telling that like, as, um, as like faith in crypto, like continues to waver, um, the UK is like, or the UK seems so low, like UK politicians seem so desperate for it to work.
905.32 918.94 SPEAKER_02  And so in the same, like in the same way as AI, like these AI companies, like are sort of looking to the UK as being, you know, one of the bases where they can sort of, uh, settle down and, uh, you know, not have to pay much tax.
918.94 921.88 SPEAKER_00  They're like the British government is too dumb to regulate us.
922.08 922.44 SPEAKER_00  So.
922.60 922.72 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
922.72 927.80 SPEAKER_02  I think it's also this degree of like desperation of like, oh, we need something to like help the line go up.
927.80 936.76 SPEAKER_02  And you have to do it in a way that doesn't involve spending any money or making people's lives easier so they can be more productive because that would just be counterintuitive.
937.08 946.72 SPEAKER_02  And like, you know, in relation to, um, in relation to George Osborne, in particular, the architect of austerity, this sort of feels like, this sort of feels like, you know, a very poetic, I don't want to say end point.
946.82 954.38 SPEAKER_02  Cause I feel like this is a guy we're never going to be able to get rid of, but it does sort of seem like a logical next step for him because it's like, yeah.
954.38 972.16 SPEAKER_02  Like, you know, one of the sort of, the sort of result of like austerity politics is just the fact that like you are now desperately looking for like any source of growth, even if that growth is entirely fabricated and who better to sort of have that, like be on the council than just like, yeah, this guy who sort of made that all happen.
972.62 976.62 SPEAKER_01  He's going to repeat history and he's going to do austerity to Bitcoin as well.
977.22 977.76 SPEAKER_00  Oh yeah.
977.96 979.38 SPEAKER_00  It's going to be worth less and less.
979.98 986.52 SPEAKER_00  Well, the trouble, trouble with George Osborne is, is, uh, once you've got, once you've got him in, he's, um, you can't get rid of him.
986.66 988.08 SPEAKER_00  He's like Japanese knotweed.
988.20 990.00 SPEAKER_00  He does seriously affect the property value.
990.42 992.44 SPEAKER_00  You know, well, the Chilton firehouse got condemned.
993.30 995.62 SPEAKER_00  See, they couldn't, they couldn't fumigate him out.
995.70 996.98 SPEAKER_00  He was too deeply in the walls.
998.08 998.48 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
998.58 1000.56 SPEAKER_00  They were getting, they were getting all sorts of dodgy investments.
1000.92 1001.06 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1001.18 1004.82 SPEAKER_01  So, so, so Coinbase's London office is going to have him embedded in the walls.
1004.86 1007.44 SPEAKER_01  And meanwhile, Nick Clegg of all people is the one who made it to Facebook.
1007.66 1009.76 SPEAKER_01  So, you know, we, we wish him well.
1009.76 1010.94 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, they're going to wall him in like a hermit.
1010.94 1011.38 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1013.60 1016.54 SPEAKER_01  Sort of Coinbase Amontillado, uh, seller.
1016.98 1017.26 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1017.46 1026.88 SPEAKER_00  I think it should be like a kind of like a mystic cosmic rule that every job George Osborne does, he has to be publicly booed at some point, like he was at the Olympics.
1027.48 1027.84 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1028.08 1029.48 SPEAKER_00  I, I kind of agree with this.
1029.56 1031.28 SPEAKER_00  I mean, it, there's a lot of good reasons.
1031.58 1032.70 SPEAKER_00  For American listeners, he wasn't competing.
1032.94 1034.86 SPEAKER_00  He was there in his position as a government minister.
1034.86 1039.18 SPEAKER_00  That isn't yet another job that George Osborne's had, like the steeplechase.
1039.18 1042.36 SPEAKER_01  Just a man who loves to like apply for jobs.
1042.44 1044.70 SPEAKER_01  He wanted to be head of the IMF at one point.
1045.04 1045.64 SPEAKER_00  My God.
1045.82 1045.92 SPEAKER_00  I know.
1045.94 1047.56 SPEAKER_00  He wanted to be Tom Cruise's boss.
1047.78 1048.06 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1050.00 1059.00 SPEAKER_01  But so George Osborne, we, we, we wish him every success in making crypto worse with all of the same acumen that he's applied to, you know, real money.
1059.32 1059.54 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1059.54 1060.88 SPEAKER_01  Um, yeah.
1061.04 1062.86 SPEAKER_01  No, who better to be in charge of Dogecoin?
1062.86 1071.54 SPEAKER_02  Also just like the real man, like all his other sort of projects, but I'm aware of like, and how they've gone, like the evening standard just sort of like fucking tanked under him.
1071.54 1072.06 SPEAKER_02  The British Museum.
1072.06 1075.24 SPEAKER_02  The British Museum got shit stolen under his watch.
1075.34 1075.54 SPEAKER_02  Mm-hmm.
1075.94 1079.26 SPEAKER_01  It's kind of the kiss of death is hiring George Osborne.
1079.26 1080.66 SPEAKER_00  So.
1081.10 1082.86 SPEAKER_00  That, that was so funny.
1082.94 1087.78 SPEAKER_00  The guy stealing stuff from the British Museum and selling it on eBay for like basically nothing just for the thrill.
1088.88 1090.02 SPEAKER_00  That was awesome.
1090.34 1092.58 SPEAKER_00  It's like shoplifting, you know, it's a victimless crime.
1093.16 1093.36 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1093.46 1096.22 SPEAKER_00  I like, I like the idea of like second order theft.
1096.34 1100.86 SPEAKER_00  Like this was stolen from like, you know, some tribes in Benin and now it's been stolen again.
1101.06 1101.28 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1101.54 1104.80 SPEAKER_01  By the transitive property, you know, it's barely even stealing.
1104.80 1118.32 SPEAKER_01  Like just to wrap up the news, you may have seen on Twitter that a bunch of people got very excited because the quarterly reports for Alphabet, which is Google's parent company, Microsoft and AMD just dropped.
1118.88 1129.52 SPEAKER_01  And the results were so mediocre that it wiped $190 billion off the value of like AI in general, a bunch of AI companies.
1130.28 1131.18 SPEAKER_01  Oh no.
1131.62 1133.78 SPEAKER_01  I know you, you, you hate to see it.
1133.78 1137.46 SPEAKER_01  And so a bunch of people were saying, well, clearly this is like peak AI.
1137.72 1138.70 SPEAKER_01  This is the end of AI.
1138.86 1142.22 SPEAKER_01  People are starting to see through the fact that it's a really shitty idea.
1142.78 1145.28 SPEAKER_01  And I would that it were right.
1145.38 1152.70 SPEAKER_01  I wish it were that simple, but instead I looked into this a bit and it turns out that this is not AI dying.
1152.82 1158.46 SPEAKER_01  What this is, is people realizing that it's difficult and expensive to do.
1158.56 1161.30 SPEAKER_01  And all of these companies are like spending more on it.
1161.30 1174.80 SPEAKER_01  It's just, we've had this like period of like hype and hype and hype and hype of AI is going to have this like big transformative step change where it's going to be able to do more than write a sort of really unconvincing college essay for you at some point.
1174.80 1175.00 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1175.30 1177.90 SPEAKER_01  And it still hasn't quite happened yet.
1177.90 1178.50 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1178.50 1184.24 SPEAKER_00  But it can draw you a Drake with an XL bully, both wearing keffias at the cenotale.
1184.58 1185.92 SPEAKER_01  That was pretty transformative.
1186.42 1190.68 SPEAKER_01  But you know, whenever you do that, Sam Altman comes along and says, well, yeah, okay.
1190.68 1195.98 SPEAKER_01  But the next thing is going to, you're going to be able to like befriend Drake and his XL bully.
1196.14 1196.54 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1196.54 1196.66 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1197.14 1207.18 SPEAKER_01  And so far, you know, GPT-4, which is OpenAI's sort of latest model, nothing's outperforming it on its own terms.
1207.36 1217.32 SPEAKER_01  And we know that the sort of like metrics for how an AI performs are kind of bullshit anyway, but it's kind of still stagnating there.
1217.54 1220.80 SPEAKER_01  There's nothing left on the internet for OpenAI to steal.
1220.80 1227.10 SPEAKER_01  Now, the next big thing is probably like putting some kind of like reasoning over all the stuff they've stolen.
1227.58 1231.42 SPEAKER_01  But that's just like, that's the same thing with a slightly better memory.
1231.42 1237.06 SPEAKER_01  And it's still being sort of like merrily poisoned by all the like Habsburg AI stuff.
1237.38 1244.68 SPEAKER_01  You know, it's still feeding off of AI content and like junk data and it's still being used really weirdly.
1244.96 1253.86 SPEAKER_00  And this is why now getting into the recruitment portion of the podcast, you can get a job working for OpenAI, drawing pictures of Drake, XL bullies, remembrance copies, keffiers.
1254.42 1256.40 SPEAKER_00  Like they need a lot of raw data.
1256.74 1256.96 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1257.14 1258.08 SPEAKER_00  We need more images.
1258.56 1270.86 SPEAKER_01  I mean, basically getting a job for OpenAI is the only way in which you'll get to do this because the real effect of this is that it's just killed a bunch of the like AI startups, which are like hemorrhaging money and stuff.
1270.98 1274.42 SPEAKER_01  So now AI is, it's not dead, right?
1274.46 1275.90 SPEAKER_01  But it's even more centralized.
1275.90 1283.32 SPEAKER_01  So like even more than it was a couple of months ago, AI is something that like Microsoft or Google can do basically.
1283.74 1291.12 SPEAKER_00  Well, it shows me that AI is like so, it's so resource intensive that I can't believe there were like small companies trying to do it.
1291.12 1292.98 SPEAKER_00  It's like having like a startup oil company.
1293.10 1294.10 SPEAKER_00  Like what are you talking about?
1294.56 1294.70 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1294.94 1297.18 SPEAKER_00  You know, oh yeah, we've got one oil rig.
1297.28 1297.76 SPEAKER_00  Like what?
1297.76 1303.16 SPEAKER_01  Just rolling in one barrel of like Brent crude being like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1303.72 1305.86 SPEAKER_02  So who wants to buy my barrel?
1306.36 1310.22 SPEAKER_02  The marketing could be great and you could be like the brew dog of like oil, you know.
1310.72 1312.48 SPEAKER_02  Oh, AI for punks.
1312.88 1313.16 SPEAKER_02  Mm.
1313.42 1314.10 SPEAKER_02  Crude dog.
1314.14 1318.80 SPEAKER_02  I mean, I was thinking, I was thinking more about a brew dog, but what if brew dog was like a pet, like an oil refinery?
1319.50 1320.44 SPEAKER_02  And so like the-
1320.44 1321.98 SPEAKER_01  Taste indistinguishably different.
1321.98 1326.58 SPEAKER_02  But the barrel would have like, you know, sick graffiti or something like that. And I thought that was quite-
1326.58 1328.12 SPEAKER_00  Mm. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1328.84 1329.82 SPEAKER_02  My startup oil company.
1329.82 1330.68 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, I like that.
1330.80 1340.94 SPEAKER_01  This is the way that we like make Britain a sort of global leader in oil and natural gas exploitation for the next generation is we make it epic and a bit punk.
1341.78 1342.68 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1342.78 1343.86 SPEAKER_01  It should be great.
1343.96 1345.14 SPEAKER_01  I look forward to that.
1346.08 1350.56 SPEAKER_00  Like smack my bitumen up, the new product from- Yeah.
1350.56 1354.24 SPEAKER_02  Oil barrels where the barrels just say mental health on them.
1355.52 1361.78 SPEAKER_01  We like to think of this rig as being like one big punk family.
1361.96 1363.18 SPEAKER_01  It's like a cool house share.
1364.46 1364.90 SPEAKER_00  Mm.
1365.40 1366.22 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1366.56 1366.80 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1367.34 1369.80 SPEAKER_00  Muhammad been talking to his chaps, you know.
1370.00 1370.74 SPEAKER_00  That's good.
1371.68 1374.46 SPEAKER_01  So, yeah, probably not the end of AI.
1375.02 1380.28 SPEAKER_01  It is funny that the market was like, oh, fuck, this is more difficult than we thought.
1380.28 1383.16 SPEAKER_01  We better like throw a shitload more money at it.
1383.50 1385.52 SPEAKER_01  But I am going to hedge a bit, right?
1385.94 1386.06 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1386.06 1388.62 SPEAKER_01  It will be funny if we're wrong.
1388.98 1389.72 SPEAKER_01  If I'm wrong.
1390.22 1391.02 SPEAKER_01  For two reasons.
1391.18 1399.14 SPEAKER_01  One, because taking over for Riley for the one thing we get wrong ever is like absolutely sort of taking a bullet for him here.
1399.14 1400.28 SPEAKER_01  He's played you.
1401.00 1401.40 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1401.48 1404.42 SPEAKER_01  He sent me forward to like be wrong about this one thing.
1404.42 1419.72 SPEAKER_01  But second of all, because if AI just implodes as well, like everybody's hoping, then our big sort of like idea of what like technocratic governance looks like is you do some shit, you tinker around, and then you call it AI.
1419.96 1425.84 SPEAKER_01  If that's unsustainable as well, then you can't do anything with technology anymore.
1426.12 1428.36 SPEAKER_01  It's just it's it all goes to shit.
1428.36 1432.62 SPEAKER_01  There's no wallpaper paste thick enough to like paper over the cracks.
1432.72 1436.96 SPEAKER_01  Is that what you use wallpaper paste for in sort of our societies, you know?
1437.96 1439.48 SPEAKER_01  So we'll see.
1439.84 1443.46 SPEAKER_01  But in the meantime, I think it's it's kind of more of the same.
1443.84 1444.36 SPEAKER_00  Interesting.
1445.04 1446.72 SPEAKER_01  An interesting portent of things.
1446.94 1448.36 SPEAKER_01  It remains to be seen.
1449.50 1451.34 SPEAKER_01  Shaking the big sort of magic eight ball.
1451.46 1451.70 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1451.70 1452.18 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1452.96 1455.42 SPEAKER_01  But first big dessert for us.
1455.80 1456.16 SPEAKER_01  OK.
1456.36 1456.70 SPEAKER_01  All right.
1456.98 1459.10 SPEAKER_01  We got to talk about the Olympic Games.
1459.26 1460.08 SPEAKER_01  We mentioned them earlier.
1460.66 1461.98 SPEAKER_01  Do we do we like the Olympic Games?
1462.04 1463.40 SPEAKER_01  What do you think about the Olympic Games?
1464.28 1464.92 SPEAKER_01  Because good.
1465.06 1467.22 SPEAKER_00  I enjoyed I enjoyed George Osborne having a go.
1467.64 1467.82 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1469.46 1471.58 SPEAKER_00  I never knew he could do rhythmic gymnastics.
1472.54 1484.68 SPEAKER_01  What if George Osborne, right, was subject to a kind of rigid, like Russian state doping intervention program where we put George Osborne on the world's best steroids.
1485.22 1492.42 SPEAKER_01  And then we saw exactly how rhythmically gymnastic a like 60 something year old former chancellor of the Exchequer can get.
1492.42 1493.72 SPEAKER_01  Anabolic Osborne.
1494.22 1495.94 SPEAKER_00  Is he over 60?
1495.98 1497.78 SPEAKER_00  I feel like he's younger than that, isn't he?
1497.82 1500.00 SPEAKER_00  He's about the same age as Cameron, I think.
1500.38 1501.60 SPEAKER_00  I have no idea.
1501.60 1504.42 SPEAKER_00  I just I fully pulled that out of my ass.
1504.84 1508.60 SPEAKER_00  Because the thing about the Cameron cabinet is they were weirdly young by the stand.
1508.86 1510.82 SPEAKER_00  And it's like British politicians.
1511.34 1511.64 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1512.14 1514.10 SPEAKER_01  50 to 52, George Osborne.
1514.22 1514.58 SPEAKER_01  Really?
1514.84 1515.14 SPEAKER_01  Wow.
1515.34 1515.64 SPEAKER_00  OK.
1515.86 1518.20 SPEAKER_01  So I feel bad bullying someone that young.
1518.34 1519.28 SPEAKER_01  You know, it's like child abuse.
1520.38 1521.92 SPEAKER_01  Mark that on your bingo cards.
1522.96 1523.12 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1523.20 1524.24 SPEAKER_00  George Osborne age.
1524.72 1524.92 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1524.98 1527.28 SPEAKER_00  Draw a green dotted line for George Osborne.
1528.50 1530.04 SPEAKER_00  Mark his pelvis and so on.
1530.04 1534.18 SPEAKER_01  But so the regular like pussy Olympics, right?
1534.34 1534.46 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1534.50 1535.64 SPEAKER_00  That's what I call Friday night.
1535.64 1541.18 SPEAKER_01  They don't like it when you shoot a 52 year old man full of steroids.
1541.70 1544.94 SPEAKER_01  And that's been the sort of limiting factor on the Olympics for a long time.
1545.02 1547.38 SPEAKER_01  And it's why they're shit and no one cares about them.
1547.48 1547.62 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1547.66 1551.48 SPEAKER_00  And that's why none of them got very far in the fucking Soviet space program.
1552.74 1557.32 SPEAKER_01  This is the theory behind something called the enhanced games.
1558.04 1558.42 SPEAKER_01  Ooh.
1558.42 1561.00 SPEAKER_01  We've we've heard whispers of this before.
1561.12 1573.34 SPEAKER_01  We're talking about it now because they've done some venture capital funding and Peter Thiel and Balaji Srinivasan and a couple of other like cool normal guys.
1573.48 1580.20 SPEAKER_01  A couple of normal guys have a shitload of money at the enhanced games.
1580.20 1585.98 SPEAKER_01  And the enhanced games is deal is you can take as many drugs as you want.
1585.98 1593.88 SPEAKER_01  We are trying to establish like the sort of maximal human potential for like doing the long jump or whatever.
1594.36 1600.28 SPEAKER_01  And I think quietly this is the only cool thing that Peter Thiel has ever done.
1600.86 1604.62 SPEAKER_01  The cocaine long jump stopping to talk about your business ideas.
1604.62 1605.26 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1605.26 1611.62 SPEAKER_01  I want to see the boxing event where a guy punches another guy's head clean off his shoulders.
1612.14 1614.20 SPEAKER_01  You know, I think we can do that.
1614.26 1616.86 SPEAKER_00  But the other guys on so much heroin, he doesn't even get it.
1618.18 1621.88 SPEAKER_00  We know what's funny about this is that this isn't even a dumb business idea.
1621.98 1624.78 SPEAKER_00  This is a hack open mic stand up comedy premise.
1625.00 1632.58 SPEAKER_00  Like the amount of people who are like 10 gigs in who I've heard go, yeah, well, I think the Olympics would be better if they just let them all be on drugs.
1632.64 1633.40 SPEAKER_00  Imagine that.
1633.40 1634.42 SPEAKER_00  And that's just like, yeah.
1634.48 1640.92 SPEAKER_00  And then some guy is like been like Peter Thiel has been to a fucking open mic and he's listened to that and he's gone like, yeah.
1641.44 1644.12 SPEAKER_00  What if they did make the whole plane out of the black box?
1644.60 1649.14 SPEAKER_01  The real story of how this got started is not that far distant from that.
1649.64 1649.90 SPEAKER_01  Great.
1650.02 1650.32 SPEAKER_01  Perfect.
1650.80 1651.08 SPEAKER_01  But yeah.
1651.12 1654.32 SPEAKER_01  So Peter Thiel, he throws money at all this like transhumanist stuff.
1654.62 1659.00 SPEAKER_01  His other big thing is the Methuselah Foundation, which does like anti-aging.
1659.22 1659.42 SPEAKER_01  Excuse me.
1659.78 1659.98 SPEAKER_01  Right.
1659.98 1666.10 SPEAKER_01  So like they're the ones investigating like how to not be old, how to remain a twink forever.
1666.66 1666.68 SPEAKER_00  Right.
1666.84 1668.56 SPEAKER_01  Crazy that Peter Thiel is interested in that.
1668.96 1669.22 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1669.42 1673.62 SPEAKER_01  Peter Thiel, he wants to be like a supervillain or possibly a vampire lord.
1673.62 1680.28 SPEAKER_01  Like he wants to like throw cars over his head and also never age, which I sort of have to
1680.28 1684.28 SPEAKER_00  hand it to him on. He read a picture of Dorian Gray and thought it was an infomercial.
1685.62 1686.82 SPEAKER_01  NFT of Dorian Gray.
1686.82 1692.42 SPEAKER_01  My rare Dorian.
1692.54 1694.24 SPEAKER_00  All my hideous apes gone.
1696.66 1698.70 SPEAKER_00  I can't even look at my hideous ape.
1700.06 1704.78 SPEAKER_01  But so this is the brainchild of one guy and it's a weird fucking guy.
1704.78 1710.18 SPEAKER_01  There's this Australian lawyer called Aaron D'Souza.
1711.22 1716.64 SPEAKER_01  And he kind of talented Mr. Ripley'd Peter Thiel.
1717.36 1717.94 SPEAKER_01  Uh oh.
1718.32 1720.78 SPEAKER_01  I have a long quote here from The Independent.
1721.30 1729.20 SPEAKER_01  On his fifth day at Oxford University, Australian law student Aaron D'Souza attended a talk by Peter Thiel, the billionaire co-founder of PayPal.
1729.20 1731.76 SPEAKER_01  Afterwards, D'Souza showed him around campus.
1732.16 1734.78 SPEAKER_01  As they chatted about Thiel's business, D'Souza asked him a question.
1735.16 1736.82 SPEAKER_01  What's the biggest problem you face?
1737.28 1744.84 SPEAKER_01  Thiel replied for the litany of problems, but the top of the pile was the unwanted press he was getting from a media outlet called Gawker, which had outed him as gay.
1745.16 1745.60 SPEAKER_01  Gawker.
1746.60 1747.08 SPEAKER_01  Gawker.
1748.78 1752.94 SPEAKER_01  Pop on down, Mr. Thiel, to the forcible outing.
1753.54 1754.12 SPEAKER_01  And Thiel.
1754.96 1758.20 SPEAKER_01  Pop on down to the, to the sauna dojo.
1759.20 1765.92 SPEAKER_01  Thiel didn't want the attention of taking Gawker to court, but D'Souza had another, more cost-effective idea.
1766.36 1769.04 SPEAKER_01  What if Thiel bankrolled someone else's lawsuit?
1769.56 1773.50 SPEAKER_01  They met for dinner in Paris a few months later, where D'Souza presented his plan of attack.
1773.82 1777.90 SPEAKER_01  The 24-year-old, who had never had a serious job, made a compelling pitch and was hired.
1778.46 1784.90 SPEAKER_01  Thiel went on to wage a proxy war, secretly funding the wrestler Hulk Hogan over a sex tape that Gawker had made public.
1785.58 1787.44 SPEAKER_00  You gonna fund my lawsuit, brother?
1787.44 1791.98 SPEAKER_01  Literally, it was Hulk Hogan, like, getting cucked, yes.
1792.10 1792.62 SPEAKER_01  Amazing.
1792.84 1797.80 SPEAKER_01  Five years later, Hogan won $140 million in damages and Gawker Media filed for bankruptcy.
1798.32 1800.12 SPEAKER_01  So, this is who this guy is.
1800.20 1814.94 SPEAKER_01  He's, like, a lawyer now, he's, like, got a doctorate and stuff, but he basically just happened to catch Peter Thiel's ear as a student and was like, hey, I will kill Gawker Media for you, right?
1814.96 1816.44 SPEAKER_01  I will be your hired gun.
1816.92 1827.74 SPEAKER_01  And it's interesting because he's kind of left this social media footprint behind of being sort of a bit of a social climber, right?
1827.80 1829.10 SPEAKER_01  Like, you can Google him.
1829.22 1837.72 SPEAKER_01  You can find articles from, like, way back where he used to do, like, stuff with, like, young Australian, like, political engagement funded through the Clinton Foundation.
1838.36 1838.88 SPEAKER_01  Oh, normal.
1839.28 1839.48 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1839.58 1845.10 SPEAKER_01  He had an unprofitable, like, business called Good Super that was going to make it easier to invest ethically.
1845.82 1846.64 SPEAKER_01  Okay, yeah.
1846.86 1848.22 SPEAKER_01  That's very TF Season 2.
1848.72 1849.28 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1849.28 1849.74 SPEAKER_01  A hundred percent.
1849.88 1854.18 SPEAKER_01  Just sort of bouncing around from, like, idea that doesn't quite work, idea that doesn't quite work, you know, trying to get-
1854.18 1859.18 SPEAKER_00  Basically amazing this guy hasn't been featured on TF before. He's been rattling around our universe for a long time.
1859.26 1860.18 SPEAKER_01  Exactly, exactly.
1860.28 1865.08 SPEAKER_01  And then he happens to sort of to meet Peter Thiel and sort of find his ear instead.
1865.08 1872.86 SPEAKER_01  And it's interesting that sort of, like, if you want to make it, right, then, you know, the safe bet isn't the Clinton Foundation anymore.
1873.30 1875.56 SPEAKER_01  It's being Peter Thiel's Renfield.
1875.56 1878.86 SPEAKER_01  And that's what he's done.
1878.94 1882.12 SPEAKER_01  That's why he's in charge of the enhanced games.
1882.56 1888.70 SPEAKER_01  And now he's doing the press round for it, where he says, this is the route towards eternal life.
1889.14 1900.46 SPEAKER_01  It's how we bring about performance medicine technologies, then create a feedback cycle of good technologies, selling to the world more revenue, more R&D, to develop better and better technologies.
1900.46 1905.88 SPEAKER_00  Or alternatively, a sprinter dying of, like, a horrendous newly discovered cancer in his thirties.
1906.24 1906.64 SPEAKER_01  Oh, yeah.
1906.90 1908.68 SPEAKER_01  It's going to melt some people.
1909.06 1910.42 SPEAKER_01  Much like Neuralink, you know?
1910.92 1912.42 SPEAKER_01  And what is performance medicine about?
1912.64 1914.96 SPEAKER_01  It's not about steroids and getting jacked muscles.
1915.10 1919.06 SPEAKER_01  It's about being a better, stronger, faster, younger athlete for longer.
1919.48 1921.30 SPEAKER_01  And who doesn't want to be younger for longer?
1921.64 1929.20 SPEAKER_01  Again, this is all just sort of courting Peter Thiel and his sort of, like, philosophy of, I should be an immortal vampire lord.
1929.62 1930.32 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, sure.
1930.42 1932.24 SPEAKER_00  And for that, he does need a Renfield, so.
1932.64 1932.90 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1933.24 1935.86 SPEAKER_01  But the thing is, this is all well and good, right?
1935.90 1939.84 SPEAKER_01  But you have to actually put on an event at some point.
1940.40 1943.14 SPEAKER_01  And that's the part where it gets really sticky.
1943.74 1944.16 SPEAKER_01  Okay.
1944.16 1948.46 SPEAKER_01  Because everyone involved in this is quite evasive.
1949.04 1952.28 SPEAKER_01  And there have been a few sort of missed deadlines of when this was going to happen.
1952.28 1962.52 SPEAKER_01  It was initially going to be last year, and now it's going to be, they're going to do an exhibition this year, and then maybe the full thing in 2025.
1963.68 1965.68 SPEAKER_01  And it keeps kind of slipping.
1965.94 1972.26 SPEAKER_01  And no one's actually willing to say, I don't think, what events, what sports they want to do.
1972.70 1973.22 SPEAKER_01  Okay.
1973.62 1975.48 SPEAKER_01  There is a line from The Independent.
1975.48 1986.42 SPEAKER_01  D'Souza says he has 500 sleeper athletes who are breaking world records in their basement and sending us videos of it, ready for competition.
1986.64 1988.70 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, but most times wanked in an hour.
1989.20 1989.60 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1989.98 1993.60 SPEAKER_01  And, like, CNN can't find any of them.
1993.72 1994.90 SPEAKER_01  None of them are willing to talk.
1995.10 1996.18 SPEAKER_01  So we have a bunch of, like, some...
1996.18 2000.40 SPEAKER_00  This is Dracula flow, like, I'm breaking world records in my basement.
2000.62 2001.86 SPEAKER_00  I'm sending you video.
2001.86 2004.90 SPEAKER_00  I got 500 sleeper athletes.
2005.24 2006.18 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, exactly.
2008.18 2013.14 SPEAKER_01  I, yeah, I don't know if this is true or not, is the thing.
2013.60 2015.30 SPEAKER_01  I do kind of...
2015.30 2016.86 SPEAKER_01  He said I've got 500 men smoking symbiotes.
2019.98 2021.86 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, maybe he does.
2021.96 2029.56 SPEAKER_01  Maybe he has 500 guys sending him strange videos of them, like, cranking out Guinness World Record attempts.
2029.56 2030.20 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2031.26 2032.64 SPEAKER_01  Fastest egg and spoon race.
2034.32 2046.06 SPEAKER_01  Again, like, I think that if doping, like, made you that good, like, that much better, we know in, like, sporting events that, like, there was sort of functional impunity for a bunch of stuff.
2046.14 2047.08 SPEAKER_01  Like, cycling, right?
2047.16 2049.26 SPEAKER_01  Like, Lance Armstrong was doing whatever he wanted.
2049.48 2055.60 SPEAKER_00  They're still on drugs in cycling because you can't do the Tour de France without being on drugs.
2055.74 2056.96 SPEAKER_00  It's physically impossible.
2056.96 2066.18 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, and so there's no, like, guy who does all of the drugs that he wants and is, like, does the Tour de France at, like, 500 miles an hour, right?
2066.18 2066.42 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2066.42 2072.14 SPEAKER_01  There's pretty clearly a ceiling on this stuff already in the regular Olympics.
2072.14 2081.78 SPEAKER_01  But the idea is they're gonna sort of, like, host this exhibition at a college in the southern United States, I guess, for, like, anti-woke reasons.
2082.26 2090.96 SPEAKER_01  And then, you know, a crowd of people at, you know, Barry Weiss's, like, University of Austin are gonna see a guy rip another guy's arm off or whatever.
2090.96 2094.86 SPEAKER_00  We're gonna prove that a white man can beat a black man in the 100-meter dash.
2095.34 2097.52 SPEAKER_02  I wouldn't be surprised if that was actually, like, one of the motivations.
2097.68 2103.98 SPEAKER_02  And the other thing I was sort of thinking about is because a lot of these guys, like, also have this weird fixation with, like, trans people playing sports, right?
2104.38 2108.44 SPEAKER_02  And I did wonder whether, like, it's sort of related to that in a weird way.
2108.52 2112.86 SPEAKER_02  Like, not in the sense that, like, they're even sort of pretending, but it's more...
2112.86 2113.78 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, I don't know.
2113.86 2117.62 SPEAKER_02  I wonder whether it's sort of being motivated by both racism and transphobia.
2117.62 2135.22 SPEAKER_01  A hundred percent. I think it's this fantastic thing of trying to have it both ways of being, like, very concerned about, you know, like, biological advantage of, like, trans women and women's sports, and then being like, I want to see a guy do as much human growth hormone as it's possible to do.
2135.72 2148.44 SPEAKER_02  Well, because we know that, like, the only way that you can actually rip someone's arm off, you know, it's totally fine to, like, have some weird experimental drugs that would allow you to, like, rip someone's arm off, but you do have to be a biological, male or female.
2148.92 2150.22 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, the six million dollar...
2150.22 2151.76 SPEAKER_02  That's the only restriction.
2152.34 2157.46 SPEAKER_01  The thing is, right, I think I could do a better job than this guy, D'Souza, right?
2157.82 2162.62 SPEAKER_01  Because I could convince Peter Thiel that wrestling is real.
2162.96 2164.32 SPEAKER_01  Because that's all he wants.
2164.32 2169.60 SPEAKER_01  He wants, like, to see some, like, big guys do some, like, strange things.
2169.78 2171.10 SPEAKER_01  That's what wrestling is.
2171.14 2172.78 SPEAKER_01  It's got, like, high drama to it.
2172.92 2174.38 SPEAKER_00  That's what Triple H stands for.
2174.44 2175.32 SPEAKER_00  They're all hormones.
2175.80 2177.16 SPEAKER_01  Human hormone hormones.
2177.62 2182.58 SPEAKER_02  I was sort of thinking, like, is he trying to invent Tekken?
2184.10 2184.94 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, yeah.
2185.02 2186.72 SPEAKER_01  Peter Thiel is trying to make Tekken real.
2187.22 2187.62 SPEAKER_01  That's...
2187.62 2192.14 SPEAKER_02  Because, like, Tekken is effectively that.
2192.22 2200.24 SPEAKER_02  It's just, like, what if you had, like, a bunch of, like, freaks who all, like, fought each other and, like, you know, some of them are sort of possessed by demons and stuff like that.
2200.66 2200.90 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2201.02 2203.42 SPEAKER_02  And Peter Thiel saw that and he was just like, yeah, fuck, fuck yeah.
2203.42 2204.12 SPEAKER_02  Let's make that real.
2204.12 2204.14 SPEAKER_00  Let's make that real.
2204.14 2206.18 SPEAKER_00  Mr. Thiel, we've successfully built Yoshimitsu.
2209.64 2213.22 SPEAKER_00  We've released him into Birmingham as an experiment.
2214.02 2220.16 SPEAKER_01  You get enough money and you just see pretty soon you start founding the Kumite, you know, from Enter the Dragon.
2220.80 2221.14 SPEAKER_01  Correct.
2221.14 2232.80 SPEAKER_01  As to whether this can actually happen, even aside from the question of whether they can organise it, whether they do, in fact, have 500 roided-up secret athletes ready to sort of, like, pounce on the universe.
2232.80 2232.96 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
2232.96 2235.40 SPEAKER_01  Triple H, because they gave him estrogen by mistake.
2235.66 2238.04 SPEAKER_00  Like, the Undertaker comes in and he just starts crying.
2238.04 2241.08 SPEAKER_00  What are we fighting about?
2242.04 2249.36 SPEAKER_01  The other problem is, right, no matter what insane state you choose to hold it in, this is probably, like, very illegal.
2249.80 2263.36 SPEAKER_01  Not just in the sense that, like, the federal government gets very interested in doping and anti-doping, but also because you kind of can't just shoot people up with steroids just because you feel like it, even if you are Peter Thiel.
2263.36 2273.82 SPEAKER_01  And so, the response from, like, Big Sport, woke Big Sport at the, you know, the IOC has been, this is so stupid we're not even answering this.
2274.16 2283.52 SPEAKER_01  Apart from one guy, one guy, the head of the US anti-doping agency, who called it a dangerous clown show, which...
2283.52 2286.12 SPEAKER_01  Is any good clown show in my book.
2286.66 2287.64 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, absolutely.
2287.92 2290.04 SPEAKER_01  And closer to wrestling, you know?
2290.04 2296.38 SPEAKER_01  So, I don't think this is going to happen, but I really hope so, is the thing.
2296.64 2301.04 SPEAKER_01  I want to see what in the hell they can produce out of this.
2301.46 2301.78 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2302.02 2309.54 SPEAKER_01  But the answer, it turns out, is probably going to be, like, just taking a bunch of, you know, Thiel and Balaji's money and just spending it on websites.
2309.88 2318.44 SPEAKER_00  I'm still kind of hung up on the idea of, like, their mission statement just being, like, at the core of the Enhanced Games are our twin values of racism and transphobia.
2320.04 2326.72 SPEAKER_00  It would be so funny to do the, like, corporate social responsibility, Black Lives Matter type blurb, but just from, like, a right-wing perspective.
2327.22 2338.76 SPEAKER_01  I mean, that's kind of what happened with the Democrat who was running against Biden in the primary we talked about the other week, where they made him take the DEI statement off his website and make it less woke, you know?
2338.80 2339.28 SPEAKER_01  Oh, wow.
2339.42 2341.74 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, the diversity and exclusion statement.
2341.74 2351.10 SPEAKER_01  So that's the Enhanced Games, and I, for one, cannot wait.
2351.34 2352.40 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, we'll be tuning in.
2353.00 2355.48 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, you can get those on BT Sport if you've got that.
2356.20 2363.58 SPEAKER_01  Just the BBC has to cover it, and Claire Balding, like, sort of covering, like, a human head being punched clean through the air.
2363.58 2364.06 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2365.14 2370.30 SPEAKER_00  John Inverdale reporting live from a man lifting a truck off the ground with his bear.
2372.32 2373.36 SPEAKER_01  This is the thing, right?
2373.42 2378.54 SPEAKER_01  The thing that really strikes me about Peter Thiel and, like, all of these billionaires is that these are, functionally, these are children.
2378.98 2379.98 SPEAKER_01  Like George Osborne.
2380.32 2385.98 SPEAKER_01  They want their, sort of, delights, and they want them in a way that is not even convincing.
2386.38 2388.94 SPEAKER_01  Is it too much to ask for all nine of my delights?
2388.94 2390.38 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, you know?
2390.72 2392.98 SPEAKER_01  Of course, the last of our delights.
2393.38 2393.68 SPEAKER_03  Mmm.
2393.92 2396.96 SPEAKER_01  We have a beautiful, a beautiful reading series.
2397.44 2397.84 SPEAKER_01  And...
2397.84 2398.26 SPEAKER_01  Oh, yeah.
2398.68 2401.48 SPEAKER_01  Let me tell you, there is no fat on this one.
2401.80 2402.78 SPEAKER_01  This is...
2402.78 2409.06 SPEAKER_01  The whole thing is in the notes, because not a word of it is wasted.
2409.54 2414.16 SPEAKER_01  I have selected for you Isabel Oakeshott in the Telegraph.
2414.42 2414.70 SPEAKER_00  Yes!
2415.98 2417.92 SPEAKER_00  Sickosmeme.jpg.
2417.92 2422.86 SPEAKER_01  Headlined, Britain will lose the next world war.
2423.40 2425.58 SPEAKER_01  It's too woke to fight.
2426.20 2426.54 SPEAKER_00  Amazing.
2426.92 2427.22 SPEAKER_02  Perfect.
2427.40 2428.12 SPEAKER_00  That's so true.
2428.52 2435.86 SPEAKER_00  Let's not talk about the way that the Tories have cut every single bit of the British army to the point where it's basically no longer functional.
2436.30 2438.24 SPEAKER_00  Let's suggest that it's too woke.
2438.70 2441.94 SPEAKER_01  We're going to suggest how woke it is in a very strange way as well.
2442.24 2450.16 SPEAKER_01  Because she begins, Swiss neutrality began half a millennium ago, after the Battle of Marignano, which ended in a thumping by the French.
2450.84 2452.26 SPEAKER_01  The humiliation was enough to put them off...
2452.26 2453.52 SPEAKER_01  They got clump from the French.
2453.72 2454.66 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, they got...
2454.66 2456.58 SPEAKER_01  They received le clump.
2456.84 2457.16 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
2457.16 2462.92 SPEAKER_01  The humiliation was enough to put them off ever going to war with an external enemy again.
2463.44 2470.84 SPEAKER_01  That policy has long been the bus of British jokes, which, again, your classic anti-Swiss joke that we all know and love.
2471.10 2471.34 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
2471.80 2472.84 SPEAKER_00  Don't pin this on us.
2472.94 2474.10 SPEAKER_00  Everyone hates the Swiss.
2474.22 2475.16 SPEAKER_00  And with good reason.
2475.56 2476.78 SPEAKER_00  They're smarmy bricks.
2476.78 2481.06 SPEAKER_01  But they may soon be the ones laughing at us.
2481.56 2487.42 SPEAKER_01  If war comes tomorrow, the Swiss will be surprisingly well prepared, whereas we may struggle to must...
2487.42 2492.80 SPEAKER_00  What, by living in a fucking mountain range with all of the tunnels that access the country loaded with explosives?
2493.00 2494.12 SPEAKER_00  In that respect, yes.
2494.42 2497.78 SPEAKER_00  Not in the sense that they all know how to use the fucking tool that gets stones out of horses' hooves.
2498.94 2502.80 SPEAKER_01  Whereas we may struggle to muster enough volunteers to fight.
2502.80 2516.14 SPEAKER_01  And the terrible truth is that in our hunger for cheap labour and casual abandonment of our borders, which, again, not to compare ourselves to Switzerland, which is a mountain range, but our borders are the sea.
2516.86 2519.94 SPEAKER_00  Like, difficult to swim that also.
2520.50 2520.74 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
2520.88 2523.32 SPEAKER_00  It is pretty tricky to swim the English Channel.
2523.44 2524.82 SPEAKER_00  I mean, just ask David Walliams.
2525.50 2530.82 SPEAKER_01  We have imported vast numbers of people whose primary allegiance is not to this country.
2530.82 2535.00 SPEAKER_01  Again, I should have mentioned how breathtakingly racist this is.
2535.48 2535.72 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2535.84 2535.98 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
2536.00 2537.68 SPEAKER_00  Well, it's Isabel Oakeshott, you know.
2537.94 2539.12 SPEAKER_00  In the telegraph.
2539.28 2544.80 SPEAKER_00  People are coming to this country because they've heard what an excess of disabled parking spaces is.
2545.48 2547.14 SPEAKER_00  So, you've got people...
2547.14 2551.36 SPEAKER_00  Because they're like, well, I'll get a fake blue badge because they hand them out to anyone who comes as an illegal immigrant.
2551.66 2552.70 SPEAKER_00  Make hay while the sun shines.
2552.90 2554.76 SPEAKER_00  And then I'll park Oxford Parkway Station.
2555.50 2556.14 SPEAKER_01  You know.
2556.14 2568.64 SPEAKER_01  As we have seen in the appalling rise of anti-Semitism and seas of Palestinian flags on our streets, a disturbing number of those we have welcomed with open arms do not share our values.
2569.60 2574.18 SPEAKER_00  But it's mostly, like, not even immigrants who are protesting Palestine.
2574.36 2575.26 SPEAKER_00  Like, I just don't...
2575.26 2576.28 SPEAKER_00  Like, what?
2576.88 2579.56 SPEAKER_01  It's just, like, people who were born here?
2579.90 2584.14 SPEAKER_01  A lot of white people also at the, like, pro-Palestine protests?
2584.14 2585.42 SPEAKER_00  Mostly white.
2585.54 2587.48 SPEAKER_02  This country is 86% white.
2587.80 2593.48 SPEAKER_02  This is also the thing, like, they've had to sort of, like, really expand what they mean by, like, immigrant and foreigner.
2593.94 2604.30 SPEAKER_02  And so, like, quite often, if you sort of follow their logic, they'll sort of, like, point to some, like, a white person that was born in Britain and, like, very much has, like, a British main, like, lots of Toms and, like, Stuarts and stuff.
2604.42 2605.28 SPEAKER_00  And being like, Huguenot.
2605.28 2608.64 SPEAKER_02  No, actually, you're going to be deported as well.
2609.58 2610.56 SPEAKER_02  And I feel like...
2610.56 2619.00 SPEAKER_02  And this, I feel like, is a very perfect example of, like, basically how they expand or what they think of as, like, what constitutes an immigrant and a foreigner.
2619.16 2627.40 SPEAKER_02  And ultimately, it does come down to, like, well, you can be born in this country and you can speak the language and you can speak it with, like, an English inflection and you are still, like, not of here.
2627.86 2628.10 SPEAKER_00  Hmm.
2628.38 2628.54 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
2628.56 2630.58 SPEAKER_00  Because even from the woke bits, like Hackney.
2630.58 2632.60 SPEAKER_02  That is the only way it works.
2633.06 2633.34 SPEAKER_01  Hmm.
2633.64 2640.00 SPEAKER_01  And it gets worse, too, because her next sentence says, indeed, some might even be ready to fight for the other side.
2640.56 2641.16 SPEAKER_01  So, again...
2641.16 2642.46 SPEAKER_01  What's the other side, Isabel?
2643.34 2645.36 SPEAKER_01  Hamas, I guess, in this context.
2645.56 2648.10 SPEAKER_01  But, like, again, if Hamas is in...
2648.10 2650.62 SPEAKER_01  Like, if we're in a war with Hamas, they've got a trek, right?
2650.70 2653.04 SPEAKER_01  Like, that's a hike to get to us.
2653.62 2654.30 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, it's tricky.
2654.36 2658.04 SPEAKER_00  And they don't famously have much in the way of, you know, troop transport.
2658.36 2660.32 SPEAKER_00  It's a long tunnel that they have to dig.
2660.58 2664.94 SPEAKER_00  From, you know, the Mediterranean coast of Gaza to Dover.
2665.42 2666.20 SPEAKER_00  I'd love to see it.
2666.34 2673.60 SPEAKER_00  At that point, if there were Hamas fighters from an adjoining tunnel breaking into the Euro tunnel, you would have to be like, fair play, Hamas.
2674.70 2675.82 SPEAKER_00  You've caught us off guard.
2676.14 2681.88 SPEAKER_01  Guys sort of lifting a manhole cover in Piccadilly Circus, you know, popping out wearing the, like, green headband.
2683.06 2689.30 SPEAKER_00  It's one of those videos, like, the fucking, like, the red arrow pointing at, like, a British police car parked on Oxford.
2690.58 2702.86 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, I mean, this is, like, again, insane that you can publish this, like, fifth column, Enemy Within Shit, in, like, a national newspaper as opposed to, you know, a sort of a National Front newspaper.
2702.86 2705.54 SPEAKER_01  But it gets worse.
2705.54 2714.58 SPEAKER_01  Defense types bemoaning the sorry state of our armed forces and the naivete of the politicians who imagine that military engagement will always be a matter of choice.
2714.92 2717.46 SPEAKER_01  Like to quote Leon Trotsky's famous warning.
2717.94 2718.16 SPEAKER_00  Do they?
2718.16 2723.32 SPEAKER_01  You may not be, apparently, you may not be interested in war, but it is interested in you.
2723.32 2726.88 SPEAKER_01  This is something the Swiss have fully understood.
2728.24 2732.56 SPEAKER_01  Which, I want to know why this is happening, right?
2732.60 2742.20 SPEAKER_01  Because did she just go to Switzerland on holiday and just was, like, was told to bang out a column and was just like, uh, there's got a lot of troops?
2742.46 2749.90 SPEAKER_00  She was doing some mountain climbing in Switzerland and one of her Swiss Sherpas was, like, careful with that ice pick and then an idea struck her.
2750.72 2753.22 SPEAKER_01  Just being like a weeb for Switzerland, you know?
2753.26 2753.42 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
2753.42 2760.52 SPEAKER_01  Just, like, hanging out in Geneva for a bit too long and all of a sudden you're like, this is the greatest country on the face of the earth because there are warrior people.
2760.80 2762.56 SPEAKER_01  These are modern Spartans.
2763.42 2764.22 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, God.
2764.58 2767.18 SPEAKER_00  It really annoys me when I think about the Swiss for too long.
2769.98 2776.24 SPEAKER_00  It's so insane to me that a right-wing Brit would go to Switzerland and be like, yeah, we should be like these guys.
2776.24 2784.84 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, I mean, the Swiss are authentically very racist, but, like, not in a way that you would think an English racist would admire very much.
2784.96 2788.26 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, because it's, like, in a way that they would surely think was gay.
2788.52 2789.88 SPEAKER_00  Like, come on, you know?
2790.58 2793.30 SPEAKER_01  It's sort of like fretting about minarets, things of this nature.
2793.42 2794.30 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, exactly.
2794.50 2803.54 SPEAKER_00  Like, you know, you've got to wear, like, a bell around your neck for a year if you want to get a Swiss citizenship so you understand being a cow or whatever the fuck it is, depending on the canton.
2803.54 2810.76 SPEAKER_01  National service is compulsory for able-bodied young men who willingly spend 18 weeks at boot camps learning how to...
2810.76 2812.26 SPEAKER_00  You just said compulsory!
2812.82 2815.52 SPEAKER_00  You just said the word she said in the same sentence.
2815.78 2819.88 SPEAKER_00  National service is compulsory for able-bodied men who willingly...
2819.88 2820.32 SPEAKER_00  No.
2820.32 2827.18 SPEAKER_01  Who unwillingly spent 18 weeks at boot camps learning how to use weapons and getting fit.
2827.62 2832.60 SPEAKER_01  Uniforms and weapons are then kept at home, ready for rapid mobilisation should the need arise.
2833.02 2840.74 SPEAKER_01  Asked in 2013 if they wanted to keep this tradition, 73% of the Swiss electorate responded with a resounding yes.
2840.74 2853.22 SPEAKER_01  And Nate, our producer, informs us that the average age of the Swiss voter is 42, and this had, like, a 47% turnout.
2853.76 2862.76 SPEAKER_01  So, sort of like if you ran a national service referendum today, it's like all of the old bastards who won't have to do it are like, yeah, fantastic.
2862.90 2866.14 SPEAKER_01  Keeps the French question mark out.
2866.14 2872.64 SPEAKER_00  Because also, for national service, when you talk about people being too old to do it, you're talking anyone over the age of, like, 25.
2873.14 2873.32 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, genuinely.
2873.32 2874.72 SPEAKER_00  Like, that's basically everyone.
2875.48 2879.10 SPEAKER_00  Like, so you can just gang up and just be like, yeah, sucks to be under 25.
2881.60 2891.16 SPEAKER_01  Contrast this attitude to the shocked reaction when General Sir Patrick Saunders this week suggested that in the event of all-out war with Russia, British citizens might need to do their bit.
2891.62 2893.34 SPEAKER_01  And, so I think about this, right?
2893.34 2905.20 SPEAKER_01  In the event of all-out war with Russia, I think my bit as a British citizen is to get, like, scattered across a fairly wide area fairly quickly.
2905.48 2906.48 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, I'll translate.
2907.02 2914.30 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, I will get vaporized for this country, sort of not by choice, you know, just by virtue of being in it.
2914.56 2921.44 SPEAKER_00  But also, like, if Russia can't invade the UK because there's too much stuff in the middle, like...
2921.44 2923.30 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, not as good as tunneling a Hamas.
2923.38 2924.40 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, that's right, exactly.
2924.52 2926.14 SPEAKER_00  They need to get some experts in from Hamas.
2926.32 2929.04 SPEAKER_00  You know, they'd have to invade, like, the entire EU first.
2930.12 2936.94 SPEAKER_00  And I, you know, call me a liberal lefty, but I can imagine some of the EU countries putting up something of a fight.
2937.94 2940.30 SPEAKER_00  Especially the ones in Eastern Europe, to be honest with you.
2940.30 2943.04 SPEAKER_00  And then, and the Russian army is shit.
2943.28 2944.88 SPEAKER_00  They're bogged down in fucking Ukraine.
2945.00 2952.56 SPEAKER_00  Like, the Ukrainians, like, who is, you know, have a lot less military material than we do, are managing to, like, quite successfully hold off the Russians.
2952.64 2953.64 SPEAKER_00  I don't really...
2953.64 2954.12 SPEAKER_00  I'm not...
2954.12 2956.38 SPEAKER_00  Because also, that war would still be going on.
2956.64 2962.20 SPEAKER_00  Like, I'm not sure the Russians really have, like, the excess resources to be throwing at the UK.
2962.20 2968.96 SPEAKER_01  Just, like, getting the Ukrainians to just, like, hold it on sort of, like, an honor system thing while they invaded Britain.
2969.22 2970.10 SPEAKER_01  Just to...
2970.10 2970.20 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2970.38 2972.02 SPEAKER_01  As a flex, I guess.
2972.46 2976.46 SPEAKER_01  The chief of the general staff might as well have said, we all head for the moon.
2976.84 2986.22 SPEAKER_01  The problem is that this country is so bitterly divided that those who might be called upon to lay down their lives might very well wonder who or what they would be fighting for.
2986.54 2990.44 SPEAKER_01  Which, this is, like, such, like, having it both ways, right?
2990.44 2995.40 SPEAKER_01  Because if your whole deal has been culture war shit, then you've been the one doing the dividing.
2996.04 3004.78 SPEAKER_01  Like, to say, oh, well, you know, what would you even be fighting for is in itself, like, perpetuating the...
3004.78 3010.48 SPEAKER_00  It's also, it's, like, so dumb, because it just ignores how, like, any of this stuff works.
3010.74 3021.48 SPEAKER_00  Like, if, like, you know, somehow, by fucking, like, magic, the Russians managed to invade the UK, like, the political effect would be massive.
3021.60 3024.38 SPEAKER_00  Like, the change in people's mentalities would be gigantic.
3024.74 3030.20 SPEAKER_00  Like, the reason why no one wants to volunteer to fight Russia is because we're not fighting fucking Russia.
3031.78 3036.92 SPEAKER_00  If Russia was suddenly killing your nan, more people would volunteer to fight Russia.
3037.14 3037.70 SPEAKER_00  But they're not.
3037.92 3039.54 SPEAKER_00  Matt Hancock was killing your nan.
3040.00 3041.82 SPEAKER_00  That's why people don't like him.
3041.82 3044.76 SPEAKER_01  Very, very few people volunteering to fight Matt Hancock.
3044.92 3045.32 SPEAKER_01  Interesting.
3046.06 3047.92 SPEAKER_00  I think more people should do that.
3048.16 3049.90 SPEAKER_00  That should be the enhanced games.
3050.72 3053.78 SPEAKER_00  They give Matt Hancock every anabolic steroid available.
3054.32 3058.34 SPEAKER_00  And then he fights increasingly large, aggrieved British voters.
3062.18 3071.20 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, I think it used to, like, increase the number of voters in the octagon with anabolic Matt Hancock, you know, round by round, you know?
3071.56 3071.80 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3071.88 3074.14 SPEAKER_01  But it turns out it's Woke's fault, right?
3074.48 3075.76 SPEAKER_01  Injecting him with Viagra.
3076.10 3076.52 SPEAKER_01  Matt Hardlock.
3077.40 3090.74 SPEAKER_01  At the heart of what could become an existential crisis, and again, I can feel the sort of, like, hunger in that, is not only the failure of multiculturalism, but the way Generation Z has been taught to feel about their country.
3091.18 3099.72 SPEAKER_01  Force-fed a miserable diet of post-colonial guilt, not by our enemies, but by the British state, which fucking where?
3100.12 3100.18 SPEAKER_03  What?
3100.88 3104.80 SPEAKER_01  I mean, listen, it's been a while since I was at school, right?
3104.84 3109.04 SPEAKER_01  But I don't remember the post-colonial guilt module.
3109.46 3111.88 SPEAKER_01  Kind of the opposite of that, to be honest.
3112.42 3118.48 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, I don't think teachers are teaching, like, Edward Said, if I'm being completely honest.
3118.48 3120.30 SPEAKER_00  Was that in between buggery and div?
3120.30 3131.08 SPEAKER_01  These days, you go into history class and your teacher throws a copy of Jasekai's Settlers at you and tells you that you're a sort of a genesee there.
3132.30 3135.86 SPEAKER_01  Many young people are openly ashamed of our history.
3136.48 3144.82 SPEAKER_01  They take little to no pride in any aspect of our past and question whether we have the moral authority to challenge those who threaten our way of life.
3144.82 3147.48 SPEAKER_01  In any aspect of our past?
3147.70 3149.26 SPEAKER_01  Any aspect of it, yeah.
3150.70 3158.96 SPEAKER_01  Not just, not the bad things, you know, any of the bad things that we, you know, admit that we did, no, it turns out that the young people, the youths...
3158.96 3166.02 SPEAKER_02  But it's also just like, okay, well, all the good things that did happen, like, in Britain, like, yeah, but they're not going to happen anymore.
3166.32 3170.64 SPEAKER_02  Stuff like the welfare state, or like, you know, the structure of society, like the post-war society.
3170.64 3174.64 SPEAKER_02  That is very clear, and it's sort of been advanced by people like Isabel.
3175.08 3176.34 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, that's not going to happen anymore.
3176.66 3178.92 SPEAKER_00  And so it's sort of like, it's sort of like...
3178.92 3180.72 SPEAKER_00  Can't even have a disabled parking space anymore.
3181.26 3185.26 SPEAKER_02  You can't even have a disabled parking space, or you can't even park in a disabled parking space anymore.
3185.62 3190.14 SPEAKER_02  Like, this is, again, I think this all goes back to, and so much of it, it always comes back to projection.
3190.36 3198.50 SPEAKER_02  But as you sort of mentioned, Alice, like, the world that they're complaining about is the world that, like, they have helped build and, like, are still very much on top of that world.
3198.58 3210.74 SPEAKER_02  And also, the fact that, like, she is writing in the only newspaper that the current government read is enough to sort of suggest that, like, okay, well, if you want to change that in any way, like, you can do it.
3210.74 3214.46 SPEAKER_02  You're like, you can do that better than most other people, right?
3214.78 3221.68 SPEAKER_02  And so the fact that you're sort of complaining, like, again, you want to have your cake, you want to, like, complain about eating your cake as well.
3222.30 3222.34 SPEAKER_02  I don't...
3222.34 3222.96 SPEAKER_02  You don't...
3222.96 3227.64 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, it's the enhanced games of crying because you got what you wanted.
3228.24 3228.66 SPEAKER_00  Right.
3228.90 3233.12 SPEAKER_00  And crying acid lime green tears.
3233.66 3233.98 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
3234.36 3246.42 SPEAKER_01  Of having made this country, like, a place which is so shit that people don't necessarily want to fight for it because you've destroyed all of the sort of, like, social fabric that people liked about it.
3246.64 3248.88 SPEAKER_01  But, you know, that's not what they want.
3248.88 3254.42 SPEAKER_01  They want the kind of patriotism that is A, racist, and B, involves, like, doing as you're told, right?
3254.78 3258.36 SPEAKER_00  Commandeeer, we have landed at Dover and it is replacement bus, nachoi.
3260.26 3261.82 SPEAKER_01  Let's invade France instead.
3262.24 3278.38 SPEAKER_01  Generation Z have been so indoctrinated about the evils of empire and supposed, big air quotes here, racism exhibited by Brexit, that it is quite possible to imagine them arguing that in the event of war, we will deserve what we get.
3278.84 3279.64 SPEAKER_01  I mean, I...
3279.64 3286.16 SPEAKER_01  Listen, I think maybe if you want to see that post, you can see it on Twitter, but I wouldn't generalise too much from it.
3286.58 3289.00 SPEAKER_01  Mostly because it's, like, it's such a hypothetical, right?
3289.02 3292.36 SPEAKER_01  Like, the Russians or Hamas or whatever are not killing your nan.
3292.52 3295.24 SPEAKER_01  Like, there's no getting that we are or aren't deserving.
3296.04 3297.40 SPEAKER_01  It's just, like...
3297.40 3298.20 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3298.20 3301.40 SPEAKER_01  In the case, right now, the treats get a bit more expensive, you know?
3301.66 3305.94 SPEAKER_00  It's also very funny that she's kind of conflating very, very different political ideologies.
3306.14 3313.48 SPEAKER_00  Like, to her, people who oppose Brexit and people who are kind of, like, online tankies who are like, Britain will get what it deserves is, like, the same guy.
3314.00 3314.28 None  Yeah.
3314.68 3322.42 SPEAKER_00  Like, like, like, Lib Dem guy in a blue t-shirt, like, attending the wooferendum is actually, like, a hardline posadist.
3322.90 3326.82 SPEAKER_00  Like, there's no, there's no light and shade in these sort of different ideologies.
3326.82 3331.70 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, yeah, a Stalinist who believes that the EU is a sort of historically progressive force or something.
3331.72 3336.50 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, anyone to the left of, like, Boris Johnson is Lenin.
3337.02 3337.28 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3337.66 3339.86 SPEAKER_01  So she talks to Marine Todd or whatever.
3340.10 3345.56 SPEAKER_01  She says, a highly decorated young veteran who recently, who repeatedly risked his life and lost comrades during three tours of Afghanistan.
3345.82 3347.22 SPEAKER_01  This remarkable young veteran.
3347.46 3351.70 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, this remarkable young veteran told me he would not fight for his country now.
3352.26 3352.74 SPEAKER_01  But...
3352.74 3353.28 SPEAKER_01  He's gone work!
3353.42 3354.02 SPEAKER_01  He's gone work!
3354.04 3354.98 SPEAKER_01  That's your guy!
3355.66 3356.04 SPEAKER_01  Why?
3356.04 3365.98 SPEAKER_01  Because our left-leaning establishment denigrates those who used to be called patriots as right-wing extremists, all the while pandering to those who do not wish us well.
3366.16 3371.64 SPEAKER_01  That guy doesn't wish us well, because he's clearly a fucking right-wing extremist!
3372.12 3376.24 SPEAKER_00  Also, we never call people patriots in the UK, that is yank shit.
3376.68 3377.22 SPEAKER_01  No, it is.
3377.86 3379.92 SPEAKER_01  Imagine being a patriot for this country.
3379.92 3386.68 SPEAKER_01  Like, not in the sense of, like, oh, this country is always shit in the, like, sort of Maoist, tanky way.
3386.78 3389.74 SPEAKER_01  But, like, just imagine doing that.
3389.86 3395.76 SPEAKER_01  Like, taking the initiative to go and do that instead of just being like, yeah, it's shit, but also, you know, I live here.
3396.10 3397.46 SPEAKER_00  It's not in our culture.
3397.96 3401.30 SPEAKER_00  We have a different type of, like, queen and country guy.
3401.70 3402.70 SPEAKER_00  It's a different energy.
3402.70 3405.08 SPEAKER_00  Being, I'm a fucking patriot is, it's American.
3405.22 3406.74 SPEAKER_00  You can't be a patriot of Britain.
3406.98 3407.44 SPEAKER_00  No.
3407.90 3410.38 SPEAKER_01  And she, she sort of writes about that one.
3410.94 3429.02 SPEAKER_01  Then, then there's some, like, weird, like, thing that was only ever a news story to, like, extremely online racist nutcases about the police choosing to, apparently, back a bunch of complaining Chinese tourists over a British bloke innocently playing a public piano.
3429.34 3430.20 SPEAKER_01  No clue what that's about.
3430.20 3431.64 SPEAKER_01  We really have a problem.
3432.02 3437.26 SPEAKER_01  In modern Britain, apparently it is no longer acceptable to state this is not China.
3437.80 3441.06 SPEAKER_01  Is it any wonder that it's so difficult to raise an army?
3441.40 3442.00 SPEAKER_00  These days.
3442.12 3444.62 SPEAKER_00  You say it's not China, you'll get arrested and thrown in jail.
3444.92 3445.10 None  Yeah.
3447.50 3447.98 SPEAKER_00  Well.
3448.30 3448.54 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
3448.76 3453.72 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, the Chinese cab driver will turn around to you and say something in Chinese which you won't understand.
3454.28 3458.74 SPEAKER_01  And then you say this isn't China and he just drives you straight to the police station, you know, where you will be arrested.
3458.74 3461.22 SPEAKER_00  Incredible things are happening in London.
3462.12 3470.24 SPEAKER_01  The other thing is, right, if the turn here is that we should be afraid of China making war on us, they've got even more of a journey.
3470.66 3481.02 SPEAKER_01  Like, the fucking, the tunnel does not exist that gets you from, like, the sort of South China Sea or the first island chain to London, right?
3481.02 3484.00 SPEAKER_01  It's just like, this is all at some long remove.
3484.52 3497.74 SPEAKER_01  And it's just, it's an insane thing to thread this needle of, like, being extremely racist against Chinese people, but extremely pro-Swiss.
3497.74 3507.00 SPEAKER_01  And I just, I think it's so cool of the Telegraph to have hired a Hearts of Iron player to really get into the sort of, like, esoteric flag fucking.
3507.76 3508.12 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3508.40 3509.18 SPEAKER_00  This is nice.
3509.34 3511.54 SPEAKER_00  I mean, look, I mean, China is further away.
3511.76 3515.20 SPEAKER_00  But on the other hand, if they invaded us, it would be a lot more scary.
3515.48 3515.80 SPEAKER_00  True.
3516.40 3518.22 SPEAKER_00  Because China has got their shit together.
3518.70 3520.78 SPEAKER_00  Like, Russia, not so concerned.
3520.94 3522.86 SPEAKER_00  Not got their shit together, like, at all.
3523.26 3525.26 SPEAKER_00  They've got their shit together even less than us.
3526.22 3530.38 SPEAKER_00  China, on the other hand, got quite a lot of their shit together, I reckon.
3530.46 3531.66 SPEAKER_00  Wouldn't like to fight those guys.
3531.74 3542.08 SPEAKER_01  In that case, we should just face them off against the Swiss, who apparently are all, like, eight foot tall Spartans, and therefore, you know, like, we can watch them duke it out and it'll be the enhanced games of war.
3542.08 3550.20 SPEAKER_01  I mean, I guess my sole question as we finish out this reading series is, boys, in the event, are you dying for country?
3550.44 3552.88 SPEAKER_01  Are you heeding the sort of clarion call?
3553.06 3556.20 SPEAKER_01  Or are you too woke to do it because you think that Britain can't be good?
3556.72 3557.72 SPEAKER_00  I'm dying for Switzerland.
3557.90 3559.62 SPEAKER_00  I'm getting out the fucking nail file.
3561.10 3566.66 SPEAKER_00  I'm putting on the white jeans, the white shirt, and the white cowboy boots and white cowboy hat.
3567.00 3571.48 SPEAKER_00  I'm listening to one final, you know, David Guedder album.
3572.08 3573.72 SPEAKER_00  And then I'm charging at the enemy.
3575.08 3575.42 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3575.86 3580.04 SPEAKER_01  Defecting to Switzerland, the chaos option, because they're so much better at war than us, you know?
3580.12 3580.36 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
3580.86 3581.64 SPEAKER_01  They're less woke.
3581.86 3583.46 SPEAKER_01  Despite never having fought one.
3583.84 3588.32 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, I'm joining, but I'm only joining because I really want the experience of, like, drinking Bovril.
3590.72 3591.88 SPEAKER_02  You know?
3592.38 3592.60 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3593.00 3594.66 SPEAKER_02  I mean, it won't obviously, yeah.
3594.84 3596.34 SPEAKER_02  Like, more just for, like, nostalgia's sake.
3596.44 3601.60 SPEAKER_02  Like, in the event of an actual war, like, it's very unlikely that anyone is drinking Bovril or doing that.
3601.70 3605.74 SPEAKER_02  But I do want the experience of having it, like, having it from a paper cup.
3606.20 3614.52 SPEAKER_01  You're applying to this on the same way as, like, for a gap year thing, where you're like, where I think it'll really round out my CV and give me a lot of life experience.
3614.90 3615.04 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3615.04 3615.40 SPEAKER_00  You know?
3615.62 3615.80 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
3615.98 3620.14 SPEAKER_00  Hussain reciting the shahad as a dying British soldier, thereby turning them Muslim.
3620.14 3620.32 SPEAKER_00  That's right.
3620.52 3620.98 SPEAKER_00  That's right.
3621.10 3622.58 SPEAKER_00  His commanding officer knows he's doing this.
3622.58 3631.16 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, I'm joining, but for the sake of diversifying my content offering, because I'm thinking long-term strategy here.
3631.64 3635.64 SPEAKER_02  And I think all the sort of IDF TikToks, like, have really given me some inspiration.
3636.36 3639.30 SPEAKER_01  Oh, British Army TikToks.
3639.40 3640.68 SPEAKER_01  Don't make me imagine them.
3640.76 3644.36 SPEAKER_02  Being the big John of British Army TikTok.
3644.70 3648.36 SPEAKER_02  And just, like, saying, like, Bovril Bosch and stuff like that.
3648.36 3655.20 SPEAKER_00  Big John Army sniper, just, like, a supercut of him just, like, shooting people in the head and after everyone going, bah.
3655.44 3655.62 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3655.74 3660.58 SPEAKER_02  The, the, the, the, the, the, the, yeah, I'm joining the Bosch death squads.
3661.96 3667.86 SPEAKER_01  Personally, I'm, I'm, I'm holding out hope that podcasting is a reserved occupation, like mining used to be.
3667.88 3668.16 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
3668.16 3670.16 SPEAKER_01  And we're sort of, like, we're all held back.
3670.40 3676.28 SPEAKER_01  Ideally, right, the, the way that we would finesse this is I would get given a uniform and a rank and I wouldn't have to do anything.
3676.28 3678.14 SPEAKER_01  And I could just make the podcast.
3678.14 3678.96 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, you're in the podcasting core.
3679.44 3680.20 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3680.26 3692.16 SPEAKER_01  That, like, go and sort of, like, motivate the troops, uh, in our sort of, like, joint war with the Swiss against the perfidious anti-piano playing Chinese army, I guess.
3692.82 3697.72 SPEAKER_01  This is, this has been maybe one of the, like, morally worst reading series I've found.
3698.02 3699.14 SPEAKER_01  It's dreadful businessmen.
3699.22 3701.76 SPEAKER_00  Their selfie sticks are far longer than we could ever have imagined.
3702.72 3703.64 SPEAKER_00  Fix bayonets.
3703.86 3712.28 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, well, this is also the other thing, like, very quickly, which is, is that, like, if you're, like, basically having a Gen Z war, if you're doing a Gen Z war, like, the real issue that you have is that, like, so many.
3712.28 3715.90 SPEAKER_01  It's all fat versus, fat and woke and gay on both sides.
3716.32 3717.46 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, but they're all making content.
3717.62 3718.86 SPEAKER_02  And this is going to be the other issue.
3718.94 3722.40 SPEAKER_02  It's just, like, well, no one's going to fight each other because they're too busy making content.
3723.18 3723.50 SPEAKER_01  Right?
3724.14 3733.02 SPEAKER_02  You know, and so you have, like, so, yeah, so you have, like, the invasion by, like, you know, China and, like, all those kids who are, like, making, like, lots of actually quite funny, like, content.
3733.62 3737.26 SPEAKER_02  And then British kids who are just, like, well, when the war is over, no one's going to give me a job.
3737.30 3739.14 SPEAKER_02  So, like, I have to also make content.
3739.60 3739.80 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3740.24 3745.00 SPEAKER_01  Their position's getting given away by, like, the vape clouds coming from their positions.
3745.76 3747.20 SPEAKER_01  Deflossing corporal.
3747.64 3748.24 SPEAKER_02  And that's right.
3748.28 3750.54 SPEAKER_02  It'll be like, oh, did, like, you know, did some munitions get fired?
3750.62 3753.40 SPEAKER_02  No, that's just a guy blowing some sick, some sort of sick clouds.
3753.40 3754.08 SPEAKER_02  Hmm.
3754.38 3754.94 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3755.80 3756.12 SPEAKER_01  Do it.
3756.62 3766.60 SPEAKER_01  Clearly the synthesis, the synthesis of this is People's Liberation Army Navy landing vessel doing donuts in the Thames in memory of Captain Tom.
3766.70 3770.48 SPEAKER_02  Giving out your position to the drones because, like, you just can't stop vaping.
3771.38 3773.34 SPEAKER_00  Like, we respected your Captain Tom.
3773.44 3774.54 SPEAKER_00  We believe he was Chinese.
3776.88 3789.68 SPEAKER_01  The tactical vape, you know, the vape of a scent that sort of, like, blends into the battlefield, something like, for instance, like, I don't know, maybe steak, tapenade, you know, this is the thing.
3789.80 3792.80 SPEAKER_01  We're going to rebrand the savoury vape into a tactical.
3792.94 3799.40 SPEAKER_01  I have also been conscripted into the army, and I've made friends with the men in my unit by bringing along my collection of savoury vapes.
3802.22 3805.74 SPEAKER_01  Well, this has been all I've gathered together.
3805.86 3808.26 SPEAKER_01  How have we enjoyed our various desserts?
3809.28 3809.86 SPEAKER_01  What a delight.
