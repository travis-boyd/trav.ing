Do-dee-pa-pop do-dee-pop fell the way
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Here is time for no man
Well, dear audience, listeners, lovers, aficionados
After considerably more than a decade, my ancient laptop finally gave out the other week
Which meant I had to download a shitload of new software to do this show
Some of which I'm not totally confident works
So I apologize in advance if there are any weird audio glitches on this episode
And I will work assiduously to identify and rectify them
I will work deciduously, I will work coniferously to fix them
Now, this is not an episode about the war in Ukraine
That would be very tiresome
And it's also not an episode about people who have a fetishistic sexual relationship with leather
That might be less tiresome, but frankly I don't get it
But there's an illustrative anecdote
I just want to make, first by way of a side comment
And then I think you will see as a segue into the main subject matter here
Which is to say
I was, in my school years
I was the good kid
I was the guy who didn't break rules and shit
Because I was so fucking afraid all the time
I was so panicked and so depressed
That I just wanted to get in and out of there
As quickly as possible
With as little happening as possible
So I kept my fucking head down
And perhaps as a result of that
I didn't realize until a bit later in life
That I had come to identify
The idea of things you're not supposed to do
Things that go against the rules
With things you can't do
I didn't really make a distinction between
You're not supposed to do this
And you can't do this
They were the same thing to me for a long time
And then in
God, what must have been 2009
Perhaps
I and my best friend in college
We drove up to New York from Texas
Because his girlfriend at the time
Was living there
And
I had never met her before
So we get to her apartment
And we're
Talking about various shit
And
For some reason
As it very well might
Money comes up
And
She says
Well, I just got my student loan
But
I spent
Most of it on a pair of
$6,000 motorcycle boots
It was either $6,000 or $8,000
I'm not sure
And
This was novel to me
And so I asked
Do you ride motorcycles?
Do people do that in New York?
And she looked at me like I was very stupid
Which I was
And said
No
And
I asked
Even more stupidly
Why would you spend
A bunch of student loan money
On motorcycle boots?
And
By this point
She realized she was
Dealing with the mind
Of an infant
And so she very
Gently
Politely said
So I can wear them
While I fuck
And it was that moment
When I realized
Oh, the things you're not
Supposed to do
The things there are
Rules against
You can do them
You can absolutely do them
Pretty much anyone
Can do pretty much anything
There may very well be
Consequences and punishment
And so forth later
But that doesn't mean
You can't do it
People can do
Pretty much
Whatever they think of
And
I remember this moment
Today
In
Yet another instance
Of realizing
Man, people can just do things
Looking at a piece
By
Lily Lynch
In the New Statesman
Lily Lynch is a very
Very good writer
Particularly about the Balkans
And Eastern Europe
In general
And
She had a piece come out
I don't know
Maybe a day or two ago
About what a
Resounding failure
The Ukrainian
Counter-offensive
Has been in that war
And
She
Picked the best
Of the
Predictions
And
Hype up
Bullshit
That
People had been saying
About the counter-offensive
Before it happened
And there was one passage here
So remarkable
That I
I wanted to record it
For posterity
Now this is
Written by a woman
I know nothing about
This woman
Jessica Berlin
Who is described as
A German and American
Political analyst
And
This last May
Talking about
The impending
Counter-offensive
She wrote
And I quote
We're about to see
What a decentralized
Horizontal
Innovative
High-tech force
Can do
Ukraine may be
Underfunded
Undermanned
And under-equipped
Compared to Russia
But those tactical
Adaptive
Ukrainian
Strengths
Deliver what
Money can't buy
And training
Can't teach
Get ready
For some
Stunners
Wow
That's
You can just
Write that
And some people
Reading it
Will think it's real
And
If you've ever
Spent much time
Around
You know
Sort of
Campus leftist
Organizers
Or like
Food nut bombs
Anarchists
And shit
You've probably
Heard
Words like
Decentralized
And horizontal
Quite a bit
And I don't
Know about you
But if
If I were
Talking about
A gigantic
Military
Operation
That needed
To be
Pulled off
Extremely
Precisely
For
The country
For which
That military
Fights
To have
Really
Any chance
Of continuing
To exist
As it was
Before the war
I'm thinking
I don't really
Want a
Decentralized
And horizontal
Those are
Not adjectives
That I would
Be eager to
Apply
And then of
Course she
Gets in
The little
Race science
Bit
Right
She doesn't
Quite say
It
But
Tactical
Adaptive
Ukrainian
Strengths
Deliver what
Money can't
Buy
Amazing
So
The Ukrainian
Is
As I think
It's
Very clear
To anyone
From the
History
Of that
Country
Ukrainians
Are naturally
Decentralized
And horizontal
Ukrainians
Have been
Living in
If not
A political
Than an
Emotional
And social
Anarchist
Commune
For the
Last
2000
Years
Ukrainians
Famously
Famously
Are
Decentralized
And horizontal
Down to
Their very
Hearts
Down to
The depths
Of their
Brains
It doesn't
Matter what
The government
There looks
Like from
The outside
Or whether
The military
Appears to
Be getting
It's
Fucking
Shit
Kicked
In
No you
Don't
Understand
You need
To get
Ready
For some
Stunners
Because
Ukraine
Is
Horizontalist
And
Innovative
High tech
Amazing
And
And
That passage
You know
Was a
Little reminder
For me
A good one
To have
Every once
In a while
That
You really
Can't just
Say shit
And
Someone
Somewhere
Is gonna
Take it
Seriously
And that
Is sort
Of the
The theme
Of this
Third part
Of the
The series
On what I
Would call
The adaptation
And evolution
Of American
Archetypes
With the
Turn of
The 21st
Century
And obviously
The previous
Two episodes
Have been about
Oswald and
L. Ron Hubbard
Whom I have
Championed as
Essentially the
The poles
Between which
And American
Life swings
For the
Last
You know
What
60 years
70 years
And
The more
I am
Made familiar
With
With certain
Mass phenomena
Particularly
Online
Mass phenomena
And
Online
Bullshit
That purports
To be
Political
I am
Compelled
To admit
I think
There is a
Figure
Who needs
To be
Added
To this
Dyad
I think
We need
A troika
Here
And
He is not
Really a
Figure of
The 21st
Century
But I
Think he
Was
Despite
Himself
A prophet
Of the
Way that
21st century
Americans
In particular
Would come
To view
Not just
The
The idea
Of political
Structure
Or political
Involvement
But really
The dissemination
Of
Data
Itself
And what
Data
Means
What it
Means
When someone
Says something
The
Force of
Circumstance
That should be
Applied to
The mere fact
Of someone
Getting up
And talking
Right
And that
Figure
Is a
Certain
Lyndon
LaRouche
Now if
You're an
American
You probably
Have
Sort of a
Vague idea
Of who
LaRouche
Is and
Was
And a
Lot of
You
I mean
Given my
Audience
Probably
Know more
Than that
Because the
The highly
Diffused
Highly
Hey
Horizontal
And decentralized
Now that
He's dead
LaRouche
Organization
They're still
Very active
They've got
People
Fucking
Everywhere
But
For
For people
Who may not
Be familiar
With LaRouche
People who
Don't
Remember
One of
His
Several
Runs
For
President
Or
One of
The
The years
When you
Know the
LaRouche
People would
Run like
A thousand
Candidates
In city
State
And federal
Elections
All over
The country
Summarizing
LaRouche
Is not
Easy
Because
In the
In the
Sort of
Dichotomy
We had
Before
Between
Oswald
The man
Who is
Desperate
To get
Out of
The confines
Of his
Own
Narrow
Choked
Life
And break
Into
History
By doing
Something
Momentous
Right
And then
Way on
The other
End
L.
Ron Hubbard
Not a
Dissimilar
Figure
In his
Basic
Makeup
I think
But someone
Who
Instead
Of
Trying
To
Test
Himself
Again
And again
And again
To
Swing
In
Sideways
To
Some
Orthodox
Version
Of
Great
Man
History
Simply
Decided
I'm
I'm
Just
Going
To
Say
I'm
There
Already
I'm
Just
Going
To
Be
The
Guy
Already
And
Make
Shit
Up
Make
Up
Taxonomy
Make
Schemata
Make
Up
Rituals
Make
Up
You
Know
Plans
Of
Knowledge
And
Action
And
I'm
Going
To
Ride
Out
The
Momentum
Of
People
Believing
Them
Until
I
Have
Built
Myself
Into
One
Of
The
Great
Men
Who
Lives
In
The
World
Of
The
Icons
I
Am
Going
To
Start
With
You
Know
A
Semi
Comprehensible
idea
And
Hook
People
In
With
That
And
Once
They're
Hooked
I
Am
Going
To
Drive
Them
Further
And
Further
Into
Complete
Unexpurgated
Schizophrenia
And
The
Nature
Of
The
Hook
Is
Such
The
Nature
Of
The
Lives
These
People
Have
Built
For
Them
Is
Such
That
They
Can't
Really
Leave
They
Kind
Have
To
Keep
Going
And
Going
With
Me
So
L.
Ron
Hubbard
Is
In
Many
Ways
Sort
Of
An
Evil
Saint
Of
Improvisation
He
Is
The
Apostle
Of
Momentum
He
Is
The
Guy
Who
Figured
Out
That
One
Way
Americans
Process
The
Idea
Of
Truth
Or
Meaning
Is
Sheer
Forward
Momentum
And
If
You
Can
Always
Be
Introducing
Something
New
You
You
Will
Maintain
A
Hard
Core
Who
Never
Really
Had
A
Grasp
On
What
You
Were
Saying
In
Any
Meaningful
Sense
Largely
Because
There
Was
Very
Little
To
Grasp
In
In
In
In
In
In
In
The
First
Place
But
Who
Will
In
Turn
In
The
Continuing
Evolution
Of
This
Project
Right
And
I'm
Sure
I said
It
The
Last
Episode
But
I
Have
Thought
For
Years
Of
You
Know
In
My
Private
Lexicon
I've
Thought
Of
This
As
L.
Ron
Hubbard
Syndrome
Which
Is
When
Someone
Who
Knows
He's
A
Con
Man
Starts
Conning
People
Right
And
Then
The
People
Whom
He
Has
Conned
Start
Coming
Back
To
Him
And
Telling
Him
How
Brilliant
He
Is
And
How
Much
The
Con
Changed
Their
Lives
And
How
Grateful
They
Are
And
How
Excited
They
Are
For
The
Next
Evolution
Of
The
Con
The
Next
Ramification
And
You
Do
That
Enough
Times
Especially
When
Like
L.
Ron
Hubbard
You
Are
Eating
Amphetamines
Like
Fucking
Skittles
You
Will
Eventually
Start
To
Think
Like
Hey
I
Started
As a
Con
But
It's
Looking
To
Me
Like
I'm
Actually
A
Genius
I
Mean
All
These
People
Wouldn't
Be
Coming
To
Me
Telling
Me
I
Was
A
Genius
If
That
Weren't
True
Would
They
So
You
Gradually
Become
More
And
More
Convinced
Of
The
Reality
And
Extent
Of
Your
Own
Powers
And
I
Think
In
Most
Meaningful
Respects
L.
Ron
Hubbard
From
Like
The
60s
Onward
He
Wasn't
Really
A
Con
Man
Anymore
Because
He
Believed
In
Truth
As
The
Further
Exponentiation
Of
His
Own
Bullshit
Momentum
He
Believed
That
Truth
Was
Not
Any
One
Certain
Thing
Certainly
Not
That
Truth
Was
The
The
The
The
Flowering
Of
His
Own
Ability
To
Keep
Making
Shit
Up
And
Maybe
Just
Maybe
That
He
Wasn't
Making
It
Up
That
It
Actually
Was
True
In
A
Way
That
Was
Baffling
And
Transcendental
Even
To
Him
But
He
Doesn't
Have
To
Understand
It
He
Just
Has
To
Be
The
Lightning
Rod
He
Has
To
Be
The
Tuning
Fork
You
Know
The
Antennae
Of
The
Species
As
Cesar
Pound
Once
Said
So
There's
A
Second
Archetype
And
You
Can
See
The
Dualism
With
Oswald
Pretty
Easily
LaRouche
I
Think
Is
Something
He's
More
Of
The
Z
Axis
It's
Not
Between
The
Two
It's
Another
Line
In
The
Coordinate
System
And
I
Think
The
Way
LaRouche
I
Don't
Know
If
The
Word
Thought
Is
Correct
Because
I
Don't
Know
If
He
Thought
But
The
Way
LaRouche
Operated
I
Think
Would
Be
The
Word
Is
I
Think
A
Pretty
Outstanding
Prediction
Of
The
Way
That
So
Many
People
So
Many
People
Operate
Now
Across
A
Massive
Variety
Of
Fields
And
Endeavors
And
Industries
I
Think
Essentially
What I'm
Saying
Here
Is
I
Think
Lyndon
LaRouche
More
Or
Less
Predicted
The
Human
Being
On
The
Internet
I
Think
Lyndon
LaRouche
Understood
And
Exemplified
Very
Very
Very
Early
What
The
Internet
Would
Do
To
People
And
How
It
Would
Completely
Change
Their
Ideas
Of
What
Constitutes
The
Real
And
What
Constitutes
Relations
Between
Different
Parts
Of
The
Real
And
What
It
Is
Exactly
That
Someone
Is
Looking
For
When
They
Are
Looking
For
You
Know
A
World
View
A
Welt
An
An
Explanation
Of
What
The
Fuck
Is
Going
On
Because
LaRouche
Ism
At
Its
Root
Is
About
Exactly
One
Thing
Namely
Lyndon
LaRouche
That's
It
Whatever
Lyndon
LaRouche
Says
Does
That
Day
That's
The
Only
Thing
That
Matters
And
If
There
Are
20
Years
Of
Contradictory
Evidence
Elsewhere
Fuck
That
Forget
That
You're
On
That
Old
Shit
Why
Are
You
Bringing
Up
Old
Shit
Lyndon
LaRouche
Was
The
The
Subject
Of
His
Own
Political
Movement
And
It
Was
Political
Influence
There
Are
Some
People
Out
There
Well
Known
People
Within
The
You know
You might
Call them
Journalistic
Community
Or
Political
Commentary
World
People
Whose
Names
You
Will
Definitely
Know
Who
Have
Some
Real
Strange
Connections
To
LaRouche
Usually
Not
To
The
Guy
Himself
But
To
The
Organization
Any
You know
Podcast
You've
Been
Listening
To
For
A
Long
Time
Or
Any
Of
The
Books
That
You've
Been
Recommended
In
The
Course
Of
That
To
Get
Background
On
Something
There
Is
A
Great
Chance
That
You
Have
Been
Led
At
Least
Once
To
Someone
With
Deep
LaRouche
Ties
Often
Without
The
Knowledge
Of
The
People
Who
Led
You
There
I'm
Not
Proposing
A
Conspiracy
To
Spread
LaRouche
ism
Through
The
Podcast
No
But
Those
People
Are
Dug
In
Way
Fucking
Deeper
Than
I
Think
Almost
Anyone
Realizes
And
It
Is
So
Hard
To
Get
A
Grasp
On
Them
Who
They
Are
What
They
Might
Be
You
What
Is
A
LaRouche
Opinion
Other
Than
The
Queen
Of
England
Was
The
World's
Greatest
Drug
Dealer
Which
Is
You
Know
Fine
That's
That's
A
Fine
Thing
To
Think
And
It's
Probably
LaRouche's
Most
Famous
Opinion
There
Was
No
Coherence
To
Virtually
Anything
He
Ever
Said
Or
Did
And
It
Is
My
Proposition
That
The
Incoherence
Of
Everything
He
Said
And
Did
Is
Not
Just
Lack
Of
Coherence
In
The
Conventional
Sense
It
Is
In
Fact
A
New
And
Higher
Form
Of
Coherence
That
Will
Be
Very
Very
Structurally
Recognizable
To
The
Sort
Of
Person
Who
Has
To
Or
Wants
To
Spend
A
Lot
Of
Time
On
The
Internet
Particularly
In
Venues
Like
Twitter
So
Just
To
I
Mean
The
Historical
Outline
Is
So
Detailed
And
Strange
And
True
And
True
And
They
Did
A
Couple
Of
The
Guy
And
They had
Someone
Reporting
From
A
LaRouche
Conference
Of
Some
Kind
You
Should
Go
There
For
The
History
But
To
To
Sum
It
Up
As
Quickly
As
I
Can
LaRouche
Sort
Of
Came
Into
View
With
You
Know
Campus
Activism
And
Leftism
In
The
Early
60s
I
Suppose
And
Was
Originally
Affiliated
With
Trotskyites
And
The
Socialist
Workers
Party
Which
He
Would
Then
Spend
The
Rest
Of
His
Life
Making
Fun
Of
And
Tried
To
Present
Himself
As
This
Kind
Of
Marxist
Without
Portfolio
That
He
Was
An
Entirely
New
School
Of
Marxian
Thought
And
That
If
You
Didn't
Particularly
Find
It
Marxist
That's
Because
You
Don't
Fucking
Get
It
Yet
And
He
Spent
The
60s
And
70s
Primarily
Amassing
A
Political
Movement
That
Was
Really
Occult
And
Subjected
Its
Own
Members
To
Very
MK
Ultra
Like
Torture
And
Interrogation
And
Attempts
At
Behavioral
Modification
Which
Is
Interesting
Because
Later
On
It
Became
Clear
That
LaRouche
Had
A
Whole
Lot
Of
Contacts
Within
The
Intelligence
World
That
He
Ran
A
Magazine
I
Believe
Starting
In
The
80s
Called
Executive
Intelligence
Review
That
Was
Apparently
You
Know
That
Was
Standard
Fair
For
Like
CIA
People
In
The
80s
People
Really
Read
That
Thing
It
Wasn't
Some
Crank
Rag
So
It
So
It
It's
Possible
That
He
May
Have
Been
Directly
Influenced
By
Things
Like
MK
Ultra
In
The
Building
Up
Of
His
Cult
And
As
He
Builds
The
Cult
It
Becomes
Clear
That
Whatever
Philosophical
Point
May
Have
Hooked
You
Into
This
Whatever
It
Is
About
LaRouche
That
Attracted
You
That
Is
Not
The
Point
That
Is
Not
The
Point
At
All
The
Point
Is
Essentially
For
You
To
Keep
Up
With
LaRouche
Is
Fucking
Schizoid
Babbling
And
Find
A
Way
Over
And
Over
And
Over
Not
To
Make
Sense
Of
It
Exactly
Making
Sense
Is
Not
The
Point
But
Always
To
Jump
Ahead
With
Him
And
Those
Pupils
Who
Were
Most
Rewarded
And
Most
Esteemed
Were
The
People
Who
Would
Take
An
Insane
New
Pronounce
From
LaRouche
And
Essentially
Respond
To
It
Not
With
Like
What
What
Did
You
Just
Say
Dude
They
Would
Respond
To
It
With
Uh
That's
Absolutely
Right
And
This
This
This
This
This
This
This
The
LaRouche
World
Is
Very
Friendly
To
People
Who
Love
Name
Dropping
And
Sort
Of
You
Know
Inch
Thin
Veneers
Of
Historical
Data
And
Shit
Some
Of
You
May
Be
Familiar
With
Their
Obsession
With
The
Verity
Tuning
That
In
Music
In
Music
Theory
Most
Western
Music
Is
Performed
And
Written
In
What's
Called
A440
And
A440
Means
That
We
All
Agree
That
The
Note
A
Is
440
Hertz
That
Is
440
Vibrations
Per
Second
And
It's
Completely
Arbitrary
You
Could
Call
Anything
Anything
But
A440
Is
Just
A
Way
For
People
First
Primarily
In
Europe
In
The
Americas
And
Now
I
Think
Basically
Everywhere
To
Standardize
Pitch
For
Performance
And
Composition
And
Everything
So
Everybody
Knows
What
To
Tune
To
Basically
And
It
Is
A
Major
LaRouche
Obsession
That
This
Is
Not
Just
Wrong
But
In
Fact
Depending
On
Who
You
Ask
An
Act
Of
Intentional
Evil
Designed
To
Cause
Anxiety
And
Aggression
And
Behavioral
Decay
In
Human
Beings
And
That
If
We
Were
To
Revert
To
The
Verdi
Tuning
That
The
Composer
Giuseppe
Verdi
He
Liked
Tuning
His
Orchestras
His
Both
The
Compositions
And
The
People
Playing
Them
He
Liked
Tuning
Them
A
Little
Lower
To
A

So
432
Versus
440
Is
To
Most
People
Borderline
Imperceptible
It
Just
Sounds
Like
The
Note
Is
Very
Very
Very
Slightly
Flat
Um
But
There
Are
People
And
Not
Just
LaRouche
Who
Swear
By
This
And
Who
Claim
It
Not
Only
Makes
The
Music
Sound
Better
But
It
Induces
States
Of
Intelligent
Meditative
Calm
Perhaps
Even
Oracular
States
And
That
You know
The
Same
Way
You can
Play
A440
Music
For
People
And
They
Suddenly
Find
Themselves
Aggressive
And
Frustrated
And
Panicked
You
Can
Play
The
Same
Piece
Tuned
To
A432
And
They
Will
Be
Calm
And
Reflective
And
Insightful
Did
Lyndon
LaRouche
Actually
Give
A shit
About
That
I
Have
No
Idea
I
The
Guy
Himself
Is
Basically
Inscrutable
By
Reason
Of
Insanity
Whether
He
Gave
A
Fuck
About
Any
Of
That
Or
Not
I
Don't
Know
And
The
Point
Is
That
That
Is
Not
The
Point
The
Point
Is
To
Have
A
Strident
Position
On
Everything
The
Point
Is
To
And
This
Is
Where
You
See
His
Difference
From
Someone
Like
Hubbard
Or
From
Your
Standard
Cult
Leader
Or
Would
Be
Political
Dynamo
There's
No
System
It
Is
The
Feeling
Of
System
That
Is
Important
Larouche
Ism
Is
A
Way
To
Live
In
The
Ruins
Of
Something
Extinct
Called
Structure
There's
No
Actual
Structure
It's
It's
All
Complete
Disconnected
Nonsense
But
Because
It
Always
Jumps
So
Fast
From
Point
To
Point
To
Point
To
Point
And
Because
It
Always
Has
Nine
Fucking
Talking
Points
Already
Loaded
On
Any
Conceivable
Question
It
Feels
Like
Living
Within
A

It
Feels
Like
Having
A
System
Behind
You
Like
You
Are
Perfectly
Well
Supplied
For
For
Any
Set
Of

Intellectual
Or
Otherwise
Because
You
Have

The

Of

And
Do
The

Add
Up
To
Anything
No
Not
Not
Really
At
All
I
Mentioned
Earlier
That
LaRouche
Started
As
A

Described
Marxist
He
Got
His

About
Himself
Is
Fucking
Insufferable
And
I
Believe
He
Wrote
I
Was
15
When
I
First

In
My

Jack

LaRouche
And
Everyone
With

Made
A
Gigantic

Right
Turn
Into

I
Want
To
To

But
That's
Not
Even
Quite
Right
Because
It's
Further
And
Crazier
Than
That
They
Became
Huge
Backers
Of
Ronald

Allegedly
LaRouche
Is
The
Guy
Who
Gave
Reagan's
Cabinet
The
Idea
For
The
Strategic
Defense
Initiative
Which
You've
Probably
Heard
Called
Star

He
Had
A
Real
Fixation
With

And
Especially

And
If
You're

Has
There
Ever
Actually
Been

No
No
It's
It's
Far
From
Certain
That
They
Even
Could
Exist
Let
Alone
That
We
Would
Know
How
To
Build
Them
But
That
Was
Not
A
Problem
For
Lyndon
And
LaRouche
Was
Also
In
Frequent
And
And
Extended
Contact
With

From
What
You

Truan
On
On
Those

Have

He

He

They've

But
Hey
You
Know
The
Post
War
Liberal
Consensus
Is
Falling
Apart
It's
The
Mid
And
We
Basically
Have
This
Choice
To
Make
Whether
We
Are
Going
To
Just
Get
Management
Just
Get
Capital
To
Take
A
Little
Bit
Less
Than
They've
Been
Getting
In
This
Whole
30
Year
Flourishing
Boom
Right
To
Have
Just
An
Incrementally
Smaller
Share
Of
The
Profits
Or
To
Completely
Destroy
Labor
Every
Institution
It's
Got
Every
Way
To
Fight
Back
Every
Protection
Because
Those
Steadily
Increasing
Rates
Of
Profit
Rates
Of
Return
That
You've
All
Gotten
Used
To
In
The
Last
30
Years
Well
It
Turns
It
Turns out
That's
Going
To
Stop
The
Economic
Expansion
That
We
Were
Able
To
Engineer
For
Ourselves
In
Part
By
Destroying
So
Much
Of
The
Rest
Of
The
World
During
World
War
II
Yeah
That's
Kind of
Running
Out of
Time
And
Some
Other
Economies
Are
Starting
To
Get
Serious
Again
And
This
Is
In
A lot
Of
Ways
Just
The
Story
Of
Economics
And
Of
Class
Politics
In
The
West
Since
The
Mid
70s
That
That
Post
War
Boom
Started
To
Run
Out
And
That
People
In
High
Places
People
Like
Say
Jimmy
Carter
For
All
The
Fucking
Credit
He
Gets
As
A
Humanitarian
I
Gotta
Think
Jimmy
Carter
Is
Out
There
Doing
This
Stuff
Because
Is
It
Not
It's
Not
That
He's
A
Saint
It's
Not
Moral
I
Think
Jimmy
Carter
Was
A
Little
Bit
More
Normal
Than
Most
People
Who
Become
President
And
What
He
Saw
And
Did
Simply
In
The
Course
Of
Being
A
Complete
Run
Of
The
Mill
Average
President
Is
So
Fucking
Horrifying
That
He
Needs
To
Enact
This
50
Year
Public
Expiation
Of
His
Guilt
That's
A
Fascination
Of
Mine
Presidents
Who
Either
Disappear
Or
Reappear
In
Some
Wildly
Different
Way
This
Is
A
Tangent
But
You
Take
Someone
Like
Lyndon
Johnson
Lyndon
Johnson
From
Age
Like
Three
Onward
Never
Wanted
Anything
But
Power
That
Motherfucker
Wanted
To
Be
The
President
Of
The
United
States
When
He
Was
Like
A
Six
Year
Old
And
Everything
He
Did
From
His
First
School
Government
Election
In
Which
He
Had
His
Mom
Fucking
Rig
The
Ballot
Counting
For
Him
Which
Gave
Him
His
Lifelong
Nickname
Bullshit
Johnson
Everything
Until
The
Moment
Kennedy
Gets
Merc
He
Has
Never
Acted
In
Any
Way
Toward
Anyone
For
Any
Reason
Other
Than
Attaining
And
Holding
On
To
Power
That's
The
Only
Fucking
Thing
He
Cared
About
And
You
Know
There's
I
Personally
Don't
Have
A
Particular
Conviction
About
The
Extent
Of
His
In
In
JFK
His
Assassination
But
I
Think
There
Is
Evidence
To
Suggest
That
He
Was
Definitely
At
Least
On
Board
With
It
If
Not
Actively
You
Know
One
Of
The
Architects
Of
It
And
Finally
That
Guy
Gets
To
Be
The
Fucking
President
The
Only
Thing
He's
Ever
Wanted
In
His
Whole
Pitiful
Sorry
Ass
Life
And
After
Five
Years
Of
Presidency
When
He
Remember
He
Can
Still
Run
For
Re
Election
Because
That
First
Year
His
One
Year
First
Term
Was
As a
Replacement
For
Kennedy
He
Can
Run
Again
And
Instead
He
Says
Nah
Fuck
This
And
Disappears
To
A
Ranch
In
Texas
If
You're
This
Guy
And
You
Have
Done
Everything
Possible
Very
Likely
Up
To
The
Point
Of
At
Least
Tacitly
Colluding
In
The
Murder
Of
Your
Predecessor
To
Become
The
President
And
Then
After
Five
Years
Of
Being
The
President
You
Say
Oh
No
Somebody
Else
Needs
To
Do
This
Job
I
Will
See
You
Guys
Never
What
Must
The
Presidency
Be
Like
Because
It's
Not
Like
It
Did
That
To
A
Decent
Human
Being
It
Did
That
To
Lyndon
Johnson
Imagine
The
Sort
Of
Just
Day
To
Day
Absolute
Waking
Nightmare
It
Must
Have
Been
For
Lyndon
Johnson
To
Give
Up
On
Power
Anyway
Why
Was
I
Talking
About
This
Oh
Yeah
The
History
Of
Capital
Labor
Relations
Since
The
70s
So
Post
War
Boom
Runs
Out
A
Little
Bit
And
Capital
Via
It's
Lapdogs
And
Government
And
Government
Adjacent
Institutions
Basically
Decides
Alright
From
Now
On
The
Entire
Point
Of
The
American
Economy
Is
Going
To
Be
Artificially
Keeping
And
In fact
Inflating
All
Those
Ever
Increasing
Rates
Of
Return
For
Shareholders
That's
All
We
Care
About
That's
The
Whole
Fucking
Game
Trying
To
Figure
Out
A
Way
To
Make
The
Stock
Price
Go
Up
Every
Quarter
And
It
Doesn't
Matter
Why
And
Many
Of
The
Mechanisms
We
Will
Use
To
Trigger
This
Will
Cause
Things
Like
Destructive
Asset
Bubbles
Like
The
Fucking
Housing
Crisis
That
Turned
Into
A
Worldwide
Economic
Meltdown
But
We
Can
Do
This
Because
We're
Going
To
Get
Bailed
Out
Labor
Is
Not
Normal
People
Are
Not
So
All
We
Need
To
Do
Is
Keep
Fucking
You
Know
Keep
Doing
The
Fucking
Three
Card
Monty
Shuffle
Of
Here
And
Saying
Look
At
This
Look
At
How
Much
Money
It's
Making
Look
At
How
Much
It's
Worth
You
Better
Get
It
Now
You
Better
Get
It
Now
Oh
You're
Going
To
Regret
This
Shit
If
You
Don't
Get
It
Now
And
Then
Flip
It
Somewhere
Else
And
Then flip
It
Somewhere
Else
Whether
That
Creates
Anything
Of
Use
Or
For
Humanity
Or
Even
For
The
Non-human
Elements
Of
The
The
And
Jimmy
Carter
Was
One
Of
The
If
Not
Again
Architects
If
That's
Not
Quite
The
Word
One
Of
The
Key
Votes
Of
Ascent
To
All
This
He
Was
Fine
With
It
And
Paul
Volker
And
Volker
Shock
And
All
That
Anyway
I
Believe
That
Was
A
Tangent
To
Talking
About
how LaRouche flipped in the 80s.
All right, the world of economists and their acolytes
who call themselves libertarians
and are frankly just Nazis.
You know, there was all of a sudden a huge vogue
for Milton Friedman, the Chicago boys.
People are being assigned Hayek and Fonomises
in graduate school like that shit matters
or means anything.
There's a vogue for Ayn Rand.
People are dropping her name in Hollywood movies.
And along that edge where the acceptable,
you know, free market absolutist
veers into being just an outright fascist,
Lyndon LaRouche knew all those people.
He was on very close terms with all of them.
It's interesting, in fact, to learn that
I didn't know this until, I don't know,
maybe a few weeks ago.
And pardon me if I've said this on the show already,
but it keeps hammering in the back of my brain.
The word privatization, you know,
that is taking what used to be a public,
nationalized or socialized asset institution,
program, whatever, and selling it off
to private ownership.
That word did not exist in English
until the late 60s or early 70s.
And it was coined by a woman who was studying
how the Nazi economy worked.
Basically, what the transition to Hitler's rule
meant on an institutional level
for the actual, you know,
pulleys and levers of day-to-day economic function
in Germany.
Privatization was coined for that context.
So anytime you see that word,
and it's a word we fucking bat around
as if it's nothing,
it's private, there's public,
some people like one,
some people like the other.
Remember, that word didn't exist
until someone had to describe Nazi economics.
And these Nazi economics
are right up LaRouche's alley,
you know, from, I would say,
the late 70s through the 80s onward.
And he also had an ever-expanding list
of people he hated
for no very obvious reason.
People he declared
essentially enemies of the state.
Often people whose politics on the surface
weren't all that different from his,
but he had some bizarre personal vendetta
against them.
And all of this, you may be thinking,
this sounds like nothing.
This sounds like just, you know,
a pile of scribbled fucking post-it notes
stuck to the walls
of a schizophrenic's apartment.
Yeah, it is, basically.
And that's what I think is important about it.
That Lyndon LaRouche
essentially managed to create
a 50, 60-odd year-long political cult
without a central thesis.
It was just him.
And the way he managed that
was by presenting not system
nor structure as such
in a time when, you know,
some of the more orthodox
and also some of the more, like,
new left liberalized forms of Marxism
were wearing pretty thin on people.
At a time when people were suspicious
of system in the grand sense,
for better or worse,
he managed to provide for them
the feeling of system,
the reassurance of structure
without that structure actually existing.
Because he realized
other people are trying to present this audience
with knowledge or ideas or philosophy.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
What people want is not to know anything.
Knowing things is a fucking hassle.
Really drags down your quality of life of a day.
And, frankly, most of the important things
that you could know
are just going to confirm the horror
of how you already experience the world.
So who wants that?
Who wants to learn in more detail
why everything is fucking awful?
No, no, no.
What I want to give people
is not knowledge, not ideas.
I want to give them
the affect and lack of self-doubt
that goes along with presenting yourself
as if you always know
what you're talking about.
I want to give people
the rhetorical and behavioral arsenal
to seem like experts on everything.
And in so doing,
of course,
they're actually going to be experts on nothing
and none of this expertise
will add up to anything.
But that doesn't matter anymore.
I think he was possibly the first person
to understand that that didn't matter.
We have entered a new era.
And here I'm talking about,
you know, the 80s,
but I think in terms of the ubiquitization
of the internet,
I think you see something
really, really along these lines
starting to happen in the early 2000s.
We have entered an era
in which the dispatch of information,
the ability simply to hear
someone say something about something,
whether it's right, wrong, insane,
completely unrelated.
You can now find anyone
saying anything about anything
pretty much all the time,
wherever you want.
And, you know,
back then we're still talking about
the sort of,
I mean, computers are institutional
and there are a few,
you know,
nerds and fantasists
who have,
you know,
home computers,
but we're just talking about,
you know,
ubiquitous TV,
ubiquitous radio broadcast,
papers and magazines
that have enormous circulation
and enormous means of publishing,
which is part of why
I think it's remarkable
that LaRouche managed
to figure this out,
that it doesn't matter anymore
what your ideas are,
whether you understand
anything at all.
What matters is the feeling
that you always know
what the next move is.
Anything that comes up,
any conceivable subject,
you have seven different
dogmatic points
on which you absolutely
cannot be moved.
And the apparent self-assurance
and self-awareness
and expertise
and confidence of that
is way more important
than being right.
People who are right,
I mean,
has that ever helped anyone?
What is being right
ever really done
for Western civilization?
That's not how we run shit.
The importance,
the important factor
is to be able to jump
from thing to thing
to thing to thing
to thing
much faster
than your opponent,
than, you know,
whomever you're talking to,
debating with,
whatever,
and to create,
in so doing,
the personal illusion
of absolute
self-possessed control.
Absolute, like,
oh, God,
this guy really sounds like
he knows what the fuck
he's talking about.
And the inner effect
of, as I said before,
of getting to live
in the ruins
of structure's extinction,
of knowing
that structure,
to some extent,
got us to this point,
that structure and system
as we have conceived them
so far
were a pretty integral part
of making the world
this horrific,
horrific,
but we're not willing
to do entirely
without them
because, frankly,
that's too scary.
And it's also
really, really inconvenient
because the way
we have learned
to sort ourselves
socially,
especially, you know,
think of, like,
the early Reagan years
as compared to the,
you know,
60s campus activism years,
both of them
were periods
in which,
you know,
any young person,
especially any affluent
or successful young person,
was basically wearing
their whole fucking personality
out in public
every day
when, you know,
the way you looked,
the trends you abided by,
the trends you refused
to abide by,
hmm, interesting,
it's all on the table
all the time, right?
The Patrick Bateman era
and, you know,
1968 in Berkeley
was its own sort
of Patrick Bateman era too.
It's less pleasant
to think so,
but unfortunately it was.
A lot of that
was about fashion.
The new left
in many ways,
not all ways,
but I think in many ways
can be summarized
as the conversion
of Marxism
into a fashion
or socialism
into a fashion.
That's not fair
to everybody.
That's not fair
to, like, you know,
the Panthers,
but then again,
I don't think the Panthers
would have liked
being called
the new left
very much.
So,
we need these
structures of signification,
right?
We need some kind
of lattice work
and internal self-reference
in which it feels like
we know what's going on,
we are in control,
and the fact that
with LaRouche
this internal structure
is completely hollow,
it doesn't mean
anything at all.
That's not important.
the importance
is being able
to fall back
on the mechanisms
and the contour,
the shape
of a system
without actually
having a system.
And
the more I have
read about,
listened to things
about LaRouche
over the last
couple months,
I would say,
the more he seems
to me to be
an uncanny
prediction
of how,
I hate the word
discourse,
but it might not be,
I mean,
god damn,
you have to say it
sometimes,
how political discourse
as such
is carried out
in the era
of ubiquitous
internet.
And not just,
to be clear,
I'm not just
talking about
people who are,
you know,
consciously LaRouche-ite
or who are
consciously attempting
to,
you know,
bewilder the people
they're talking to
into silence.
No,
not at all.
Those people are
the most obvious,
but the whole problem
is it's baked
into the platform.
And
to look at LaRouche
in, say,
the 80s,
you know,
swinging from
his weird excuses
for Marxism
all the way over
to just
horrifically racist
screeds about
urban crime
and drug use
and his desire
to put
people with
HIV and AIDS
in permanent
quarantine camps,
you know,
that sort of thing.
The connections
between them
such as they exist,
they don't really
fucking matter
because it is
an endless
supply
of,
you know,
faster than
you can blink
bullet points.
And
if someone
challenges you
to
connect
one of those
opinions
to another
one of those
horrific opinions,
you hit them
with nine
more bullet points.
You have people
looking up
your fucking
allusions
and references.
Everything you say
needs to come
with a bibliography.
Have you read
any of that shit?
Hell no.
But
it is
this exact
sort of
I guess
what you could
call
not
structure
but
structureism.
The
imperative
of something
resembling
structure
which
itself
is
completely
empty
that I think
we can see
transfer
directly from
LaRouche
and
his
particular
form of
if politics
politics is the word
I guess
thin politics
to the way
everybody talks
all the time
now on the
internet
particularly
about
politics
because we
are now
afforded this
opportunity
such as it is
to live
in the ruins
of that extinct
system
and to find
in those
ruins
infinite
internal
self-reference
there is so much
fucking material
you can find
so many people
saying so many
things
regardless of
whether they're
true, false,
good, bad
doesn't matter
you can find
anyone claiming
anything
on the internet
and to go
to the point
where someone
investigates
a claim
that is not
going to lead
to a
most of the
time
to a
clear cut
answer
that's going
to lead
to further
investigation
of what
the second
party
is taking
this from
and then
to further
investigation
of where
the third
fourth
fifth
parties
got this
and this
is something
I think
I'm going
to do
an entire
show about
but just
to hint
at it
now
it is
the
realization
that
after a
certain
point
of media
ubiquity
after a
certain
point
in which
we are
all
plugged
into
information
machines
all the
time
nothing
ever
gets
simple
simplicity
as such
is dead
nothing
will ever
be simple
again
because
once you
pass
this point
of
the
sheer
mass
and
availability
of
information
information
the
only
way
to
look
into
anything
is by
acquiring
a whole
new
mass
of
information
to
explain
the
first
thing
and
this
does
not
make
it
simpler
this
does
not
allow
you
to
reach
any
kind
of
sane
or
quick
conclusion
this
means
now
you
have
a
whole
fucking
galaxy
of
bullet
points
that
you
now
have
to
investigate
where
each
one
of
those
came
from
and
then
where
each
one
of
their
sources
came
from
and
then
where
each
one
of
the
sources
came
from
because
you
are
plugged
into
this
machine
that
shits
information
into
your
mouth
all
day
every
day
and
the
nature
of
the
platform
and
here
I'm
thinking
particularly
about
Twitter
is
to
flatten
everything
said
on
it
into
sort
of
the
same
not
emotional
tone
exactly
but
sort
of
the
same
level
of
importance
to
your
life
or
inward
coherence
or
ability
to
adapt
to
you
such
that
it
can
become
parasitic
upon
you
everything
is
crunched
down
into
this
tonal
and
structural
and
formalized
framework
in which
any piece
of information
right
wrong
true
false
whatever
is
essentially
exchangeable
for any
other
piece
and
you can
find
anyone
saying
anything
all the
time
and
if
you
want
to
get
past
simply
anyone
saying
anything
we
have
gone
way
way
beyond
that
you
know
omega
point
of
the
sheer
mass
of
information
at
which
you
are
ever
going
to
be
able
to
look
something
up
you
know
in
one
trusted
resource
and
go
oh
yeah
that
guy
was
right
or
yeah
that
guy
is
full
of
shit
no
no
no
the
who
am I
taking
that
from
Pierre
Teilhard
de
Chardin
I
think
the
point
omega
for
the
biomass
of
information
was
a
long
long
long
time
ago
and
I
think
this
is
something
you
start
to
see
in
politics
and
particularly
you know
deep
politics
if you
want to
call
them
that
going
back
to
the
60s
in
particular
because
their
connections
to
the
roots
of
you know
the
internet
and
Silicon
Valley
in
basically
CIA
and
Pentagon
contractors
you know
they were
dealing with
this stuff
firsthand
a long
time before
the rest
of us
were
and I
think
there's a
good history
to be
done
of the
recent
evolution
of complexity
and the
points in
various ways
in various
fields
at which
you stop
being able
to simplify
anything
forever
and
I think
you can
see that
happening
in
some
pretty
specific
moments
and
movements
in
the
political
underworld
20
25
30
years
before
you
start
to
see
that
in
the
life
of
the
average
individual
person
and
I
think
that
helps
explain
some
of
the
dissonance
between
what
history
has
purportedly
been
over
the
last
50
odd
years
and
what's
actually
been
going
on
this
entire
time
I
said
20
25
years
ago
because
I
was
thinking
for a
moment
it was
still
the
year
2000
because
I'm
very
old
I'm
talking
about
the
late
60s
early
70s
and
then
very
clearly
in
the
80s
and
I
think
LaRouche
ism
to the
extent
that
it's
an
ism
at
all
is
a
kind
of
uncanny
oracular
presage
of
this
awareness
that we
have
entered
a point
of
infinite
internal
self
illusion
that
you
have
thing
A
which
points
you
to
thing
B
and
that
there
is
no
medium
or
denominator
to check
either
of
those
things
against
thing
B
now
points
to
things
C
and
D
thing
C
points
to
things
E
F
and
G
thing
D
points
to
things
H
I
and
J
on
and
on
and
on
and
on
and
this
is
something
that
if
you're
familiar
with
Jacques
Derrida
or
Gilles
Deleuze
and
Félix
Guattari
70s
kind
of
post-structuralist
philosophers
you will
see them
talking
about
in
different
domains
I think
in
Derrida
particularly
in
language
and
the way
that
philosophy
is
necessarily
a product
of
language
and
in
Deleuze
and Guattari
a whole
lot of
shit
but
I
don't
think
they
knew
that
they
were
not
the
avant-garde
in
this
case
capital
and
power
were
the
avant-garde
capital
and
power
understood
fucking
Gilles
Deleuze
a long
time
before
any
graduate
student
did
because
it's
clear
from
the
very
early
days
of
this
kind
of
new
complexity
I'm
talking
about
that
they
grasp
the
important
thing
is
ramification
it's
not
where
it
goes
it's
just
a
network
that
always
keeps
growing
and
your
life
if
you
either
want
it
to
or
you
are
forced
for
it
to
be
this
way
your
life
can
become
nothing
but
the
trawling
through
one
network
until
you
die
that
grows
exponentially
in front
of you
every
day
and
the
story
of
your
life
such
as
you
have
one
is
just
the
few
sort
of
guiding
principles
you
went
in
there
with
and
then
how
you
lose
them
over
time
and
then
how
desperation
eventually
leads
you to
pick up
other
principles
that
will
tend
to
get
crazier
and
crazier
as
you
are
more
and
more
in
need
of
some
kind
of
assurance
that
you
haven't
wasted
your
life
digging
through
insane
nonsense
and
as
that
need
then
ramifies
itself
from
merely
intellectual
satisfaction
to
the
feeling
of
having
been
a
person
at
all
to
medical
problems
to
religious
and
metaphysical
questions
every
time
you
drop
one
set
of
principles
and
wait
for
another
to
stick
to
you
the
next
set
of
principles
is
going
to
be
fucking
crazier
because
it
will
need
to
explain
and
to
assuage
more
of your
own
life
more
facets
more
time
all
of
that
but
those
principles
will
also
have
been
coughed
up
by
another
infinitely
ramifying
network
that gets
more
schizoid
at
every
step
every
break
every
branching
and
I
think
that
in
insofar
as
LaRouche
had
any
kind
of
actual
political
philosophy
like
in a
working
sense
in a
sense
of
you know
who
the
sides
were
he was
known
to say
there's
good
mafia
and
bad
mafia
and
I
think
as
little
as
we
may
want
to
admit
it
in
so
many
cases
and
not
just
deep
politics
here
that's
part
of
the
reason
I
mentioned
the
Ukraine
war
at the
beginning
of
this
I
think
that
we
you know
my
generation
and
and
the
one
or
whatever
one and a
half
after it
whatever
you would
call it
have
become
through
our
constant
you know
barraging
with
more
information
and more
technological
means
of
delivering
that
information
than we
can
possibly
cope
with
I
think
there
is a
general
sort
of
sense
that
if
you've
got
a
rule
if
you've
got
anything
to
hang
on
to
the
world
by
it's
that
there's
good
mafia
and
bad
mafia
a
statement
that when
LaRouche
made it
you know
would have
and would
have seemed
and still
to me
does seem
you know
fucking
ethically
abhorrent
but
it is also
unfortunately
proven to be
a much
more
accurate
heuristic
than the
idea that
one side
is fighting
for this
and the
other side
is fighting
for that
and you
vote for
the people
who are
fighting
for you
no no
that's a
terrible
idea
that is
not how
any of
this shit
works at
all
there are
way more
than two
sides
and not
a single
goddamn
one of
them
will tell
you
straight up
what it
is they're
doing
and to
understand
what they're
doing
and what
they want
to do
and what
they want
to continue
to do
you then
have to
get into
a new
infinitely
ramifying
web of
complexity
until you
know you
try to talk
to someone
on the
base level
about
politics
and they
like well
the election
is coming
up and
you just
start frothing
at the
mouth and
naming you
know think
tanks where
purported
cabinet picks
for one of
the presidential
nominees
right before
this going
that's
Saudi money
he knew
Adnan Khashoggi
and in
1983 he
was on a
fucking jet
with Manu
Herko
Bonifar
and that
will lose
you a lot
of friendly
acquaintances
and though
it does
I think
lead to
a better
understanding
though I
think it
does give
you a much
more accurate
picture of
the world
than believing
this kind
of dumbass
Manichian
dualism
that we
have been
presented with
for so
long
it is also
a picture
of the
world
in which
the most
basic
criterion
is that
so much
of it
the vast
majority
of it
is always
going to
be beyond
your grasp
and the more
you try to
understand
and the more
understanding
you do pick
up because
of course you
can learn
things
that extra
understanding
the price
for it
is going
to be
an
unfathomable
unfathomable
deluge
of things
that you
will never
understand
things that
you know
someone
somewhere
knows what
this means
someone
somewhere
knows why
this happened
and I will
never
meet that
person
and if I
did
he would
never
tell me
the truth
and if
you do
this for
any length
of time
I'm sure
people listening
to this
show
understand
it
you pick
up this
fucking
ghost
world
of people
who are
following
you around
for the
rest of
your
goddamn
life
and every
once in
a while
reappear
in whatever
you're
reading
whatever
you're
researching
paying
attention
to
and
and they
are
in the
worst
sense of
the word
they are
your
familiars
you don't
want them
to be
your
familiars
that's
not a
good
thing
they become
the little
fucking
talismanic
demons
who mark
your
your entire
base
what should
I call
it
your tonality
of
seeing the
world
right
because it's
not a
structure
exactly
or at least
it's not a
structure
in the simple
sense
it's
it's not
a system
as such
it is
everything
you've been
able to
learn
and then
the sort
of the
timbre
the feeling
the color
of how
you can
apply that
when you
encounter
something new
you know
which way
you tack
into the
wind
which things
make you
go okay
that's probably
more or less
kind of right
and which things
immediately make
you fucking
raise your
shoulder
against the
wind
and go
no no no
no no
no fuck
that who
is this
person where
did this
bullshit come
from and
larouche was
living in that
world arguably
his entire
life larouche
had the mind
of a of a
you know an
internet poisoned
uh deep
politics twitter
person in
the the 50s
maybe the
60s and
he had time
to refine
that kind of
mind
into the
understanding
that totally
doing away
with system
totally being
you know in
the literalist
sense of the
word post
structuralist
well no one's
really gonna do
that because
no one can
really walk
around every
day uh
knowing let's
say knowing
internally and
knowing subjectively
that um they
will never
understand anything
and the meaning
of the tiniest
phenomenon is
infinitely beyond
their grasp
and nothing
they see is
ever what it
appears to be
the only people
who can do
that generally
are deeply
mentally ill
people such
as your
your humble
host here
and um
people who
are not
gonna live
that long
people who
one way or
another are
either going
to take a
wild left
turn into
some other
kind of
life or
who for
whatever reason
self-administered
or otherwise
are just not
going to be
able to
handle the
world for
very long
because they
understand too
much of it
which is to
say they
understand too
little of it
as well and
I think that a
key point of
contrast between
LaRouche and
someone like
Hubbard is
that you know
Scientology still
has this vast
apparatus of
suppressing
dissent and
cutting off
information from
outside and all
that basically if
you say anything
critical of
Scientology in
public you are
declared an
SP they
fucking love
abbreviations a
suppressive
person and
there have been
arguments within
people who study
this about what
exactly that
means whether
an SP is just
you know someone
to exclude or
something darker
than that I
personally do
know however
that L. Ron
Hubbard though
he was like a
1920s Gilbert and
Sullivan theater
queen so who
knows how
seriously to
take this but
he was asked
during one of
his lectures
what how
should how
should one deal
with SPs and
he explained
that after a
certain level of
suppressive behavior
SP has become
something Scientologists
call fair game
and then his
explanation of what
to do with fair
game was pulling
out a gun and
shooting a hole in
the floor
however seriously
you want to take
that still you can
see that the
apparatus is
trained is
designed to cut
off outside sources
of contradictory
information and
I think
LaRouche is
the first
citizen of
the 21st
century in
the sense that
he made no
attempt to
withhold
contradictory data
because he
understood there
is an event
horizon being
reached here
there is a
stellar mass
there is an
omega point
past which the
control of
information in
terms of
elision and
censorship will
become technologically
impossible and
instead the
21st century is
going to be
turning that
information into
a fucking fire
hose that is
blasting down all
of our throats
24 fucking
seven and then
coming along and
being able to
give people the
impression that hey
you know how you're
drowning every day
you know how your
lungs are full of
fucking water you
can barely see
you're thrown on
your fucking back on
the sidewalk every
time you try to
stand up well I'm
going to teach you a
way to navigate that
is it true what is
true I think true
means that you
would rather not be
down there on the
sidewalk with a
cracked skull I
think true means that
this is no way for a
human being to live
and so I'm going to
teach you to deal
with infinite
information not by
understanding it
fuck that what does
that even mean but
by by teaching you a
way to remain in
constant motion from
point to point to
point such that no
one can ever pin you
down anywhere because
being pinned down at
one point was a was a
goal of self image of
self actualization you
know what do you want
to call yourself all
the fucking bullshit
sectarian you know
college student
political battles of
the 60s at one point
that was desirable now
being pinned down is
death full on full
stop there's no way to
get away from it and I
can't take the fire
hose away but I can
teach you to drink
from it
I can't take the
about時間 and

Well, I grew up in the client state of a petro king
With a complicated take on things like human rights
But baby, that's the sacrifice
Bringing joy to the world
And I learned young how the West was one
With Christ's big heart and a bigger gun
But it wasn't enough, so we took the moon
Cause Nazi rock, it's science too
It can bring joy to the world
War on drugs, this righteous cause
To clear our streets of criminals
Now civilized by an opioid
So the Sackler family can enjoy
Spreading joy
Around the world
For New York City, the world loves you
And retribution's surely due
For the zealots who brought you hell
Boy, the heroes and Langley taught them well
How to infiltrate joy
And do it to the world
Can't we all just get along
Like Amazon and Raytheon
Coming together to make a drone
To bring us lunch and kill the sun
In a city just to do the one
Holistic joy
To the world
To the world
Please stop resisting all the joy
In your world
Just a car full of celebrities
Singing about the joy
In your world
In your world
In your world
In your world
In your world
A string of bad luck
In this final turn
We gathered around
Watched our cities burn
Who could have possibly predicted this?
Said everyone
So we boldly venture into the black
Guided by a grand soundtrack
We'll liberate
So foreign stars
And stick a flag
On the face of Mars
The beauty of starting again
Your patience, zero and original sin
The mantra rings across the land
Across the land
How clever
Look at us
We've done it again
We're bringing joy
To whole new worlds
You must admit
We've certainly got an effort
Bringing joy
To whole new worlds
In time these aliens
Will run out of the joy
We'll bring our home
New worlds
We're bringing joy
To your world
We're bringing joy
We're bringing joy
To your world
You better hope you don't have cheap
Bananas arise
We're bringing joy
To your world
You better hope you don't have cheap
Bananas arise
You better hope you don't have cheap bananas or rice
We're bringing joy to your world
You better hope you don't have dead dinosaurs
We're bringing joy to your world
You better hope you don't have big plans or rice will bring in
