On this season, we'll be covering our vehicles of hysteria, how pop culture and the media
shape our psychology and society, and how our national mythologies manipulate the realities
we share, and sometimes the realities we don't.
I'm your host, Chelsea Weber-Smith, and this is American Hysteria.
Who killed JonBenet Ramsey?
The Zodiac killer sent cryptograms to newspapers and the police.
Sharon Tate's mother has dedicated herself to keeping the killers in prison.
There was some real deep and intense work that she did, just a bigger sense of justice
in the universe.
JonBenet Ramsey has one of the most recognizable faces in American history.
Permanently glossy from both her heavy pageant makeup and the fact that we saw her most often
on the cover of sheeny tabloids as we waited in line at the grocery store, set forever
next to the rows of bright gum and candy bars.
On Christmas of 1996, JonBenet was found missing from her room, and a strange and rambling ransom
note was discovered on the stairs, the longest in American crime history.
But the little girl, just six years old, was not waiting somewhere to be rescued.
She was downstairs in the wine cellar, already bludgeoned and strangled to death.
This monumental mystery that came in the middle of the 1990s true crime boom had everything.
A rich and possibly twisted, perfect American family.
A strong whiff of stranger danger with a man possibly climbing through the window to find
her.
A ransom note to dissect.
Conflicting testimony and eyewitness accounts.
Both a lack of strong evidence and a plethora of tiny pieces that so many of us believed and
still believe may one day add up to an answer.
And as we hear, again and again, in these highly publicized true crime cases, doesn't America
deserve an answer?
Our current true crime boom has given us endless docuseries and films, podcasts and books.
Some that breathe life back into cold cases.
Some that expose injustice and exonerate the wrongfully accused.
And others that seem to exist for pure and lucrative entertainment.
Many sociologists and psychologists, both academic and armchair, theorize at length about the reasons
we're drawn to these gruesome stories.
A common explanation is that people, especially women who consume the most true crime, are looking
to learn how to avoid dangerous situations, the warning signs that can show us the future
like a hand of dark tarot cards.
Some believe that through examining these American monsters, we can also explore our own shadow
selves.
Others say it releases our anxieties about the world in a controlled setting, the way
that horror movies can.
And then there are those who claim that it's all schadenfreude, a gross fascination, the
visceral and sensitive thrill of seeing people worse off than you.
The feelings about the morality of true crime run the gamut.
But I'm not here to shame anybody today, because if I did, I would be a hypocrite.
I don't think that there's any singular reason that people love true crime.
It's a combination of so many factors.
But there may be another important underlying need that true crime soothes in us.
A hunger for justice that may mean more about us on a biological, psychological, and political
level than it does about the tragedies of others that we love to digest.
But in our fear of these American monsters, who else is caught up in the duality of victim
and criminal?
And how are these stories used in ways we may not even notice?
Public fear is a very useful tool, especially when its lens is focused on the most sensational
of boogeymen.
Uncaught, sadistic geniuses.
Hippie cults smearing ritual blood on the walls.
Allegedly handsome men with broken arms calling you sweetly into their car.
And silent psychopaths slipping in through your window at night.
In the case of the child beauty queen found murdered in her Colorado home, Boulder police
detectives have now returned from interviewing about 30 people in Georgia where JonBenet Ramsey
has relatives and where she was buried.
I want to be a cowboy sweetheart.
JonBenet was polished and precocious.
Part of a world involving children paraded before their friends and parents, she was named
Little Miss Colorado.
Meanwhile, people who didn't even know JonBenet are stopping by the house to lay tributes.
Just really touches your heart.
Documentaries and shows made for TV movies and tabloid accusations about JonBenet Ramsey
still crop up in what seems like a constant stream of content, revealing very little that
we didn't already know.
In 2016, on a large scale, CBS was able to sway public opinion about the case almost violently
toward Burke Ramsey, who was nine years old at the time of his sister's murder.
With a smattering of criminology stars, their documentary called The Case of JonBenet Ramsey
premiered to a still hungry audience 20 years after the murder, amassing 10 million viewers,
outpacing the Emmys of that year.
The miniseries presented evidence that Burke had killed his sister in a jealous rage and
that his parents had covered it up.
They ran through the typical gamut, the ransom note, the jarring 911 call, the pineapple in the
belly of a murdered girl.
But then they did something that no one else had yet.
They took it to the next level.
They attempted to construct a replica of JonBenet's head, starting with a replica papier-mâché
skull, which was then wrapped in pig meat and grotesquely affixed with a terribly askew
blonde wig.
Enter a 10-year-old boy, the stand-in for Burke, who was instructed to bash the head of this
nauseating version of a 6-year-old girl with what the show purported to be the murder weapon,
a heavy flashlight.
And he did.
And like any kid getting to smash anything, he enjoyed it.
It was shocking.
This shaky accusation was not helped by an interview with the smirking Burke, clearly a strange and
uncomfortable person, and a nervous smiler like me.
Well, he came across perfectly.
CBS could not have asked for a better villain.
Burke would go on to sue the network and win.
But I haven't really heard anyone talk about the case since who did not immediately express
their confidence that it was indeed a 9-year-old boy who did it, someone who would have never
faced jail time, who never went on to commit any other crimes.
If you follow the case with any passion at all, you might even be mad at me for saying
that maybe he's not the killer and that we will almost certainly never know who the killer
really was.
But I want it so bad.
Maybe you do too.
True crime has always been a genre that begs involvement.
It has a call to action.
True crime asks you to be a part of history to help figure it out.
In fact, it was the JonBenet Ramsey case that began the phenomenon now known as the internet
sleuth, marking the greatest advancement in community involvement in each episode.
Usenet emerged at the heart of this movement.
Usenet emerged at the heart of this movement.
A movement before YouTube, before Facebook, before Reddit, when the web was almost completely
made up of text and photos.
Rarely equipped with training or credentials, these armchair detectives would upload documents
and pictures, pore over transcripts, analyze the ransom notes' handwriting, and of course,
post their theories and argue prolifically.
By late 1997, USA Today had found that at least 2,000 websites were dedicated to solving the case, a very big number for the early internet era.
A leader soon emerged.
A North Carolina housewife named Susan Bennett with the alias Jameson would plaster across a popular forum called WebSleuths, as well as other websites that she would later create herself.
In the vast recesses of the internet, this sounds pretty unremarkable.
But not so when we follow her journey into newspapers and television, into her role as a de facto expert on the JonBenet Ramsey case.
This stay-at-home mom from North Carolina calls it her addiction.
Somebody says, you know, but you're addicted, you're addicted.
Well, everybody's got an addiction.
And now has fans following in her footsteps.
We're online detectives, and we're so involved with the case that we like to have it solved.
She starred on a late 90s episode of 48 Hours, where she was presented as a serious authority, actually there to try to discredit the handwriting analysis of experts in the case.
All these years later, tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of serious online sleuths are still trying to crowdsource similar crimes, becoming these de facto experts in tragedies that have absolutely nothing to do with them.
With the internet, we got to add our own voices, our own opinions on whodunit, no matter how uncouth, into the snarling internet, in the name of justice.
Before our recent boom, the 1990s were the heyday of true crime, and of what are commonly referred to as media circuses as trials by media, like the deeply polarizing trial of O.J. Simpson.
After a televised police chase, his white Bronco driving at modest speed down L.A.'s I-5 freeway, followed by a handful of cop cars matching its pace.
This chase would actually interrupt the 1994 NBA Finals Game 5, taking up most of the screen with a corner dedicated to the game.
Three seconds, violation.
This is a Channel 5 News special report.
California Highway Patrol is in pursuit of a white Ford Bronco, a car that was reported to be one that might contain O.J. Simpson and a friend earlier today.
95 million people, more than any NBA championship or Super Bowl audience prior, tuned in to watch the coverage, causing that 1994 championship series to receive a record low in viewership.
Maybe you remember that.
Maybe you remember that.
It was nuts.
But then, you remember that.
And suddenly, we all kind of felt like we were a part of it.
Court TV had made its premiere a handful of years before, as laws around the use of cameras in the courtroom disappeared.
In this way, any person with that channel could watch it all unfold, as if you were there, as if you were part of the trial.
But watching mysteries being solved and punishments play out live has always been a huge part of our culture, an import from the brutal gallows of England, but with our very own American Puritan flair.
The most famous and vocal Puritan there ever was, the man I like to call witch trial bitch Cotton Mather, was the beacon of morality in the late 17th and early 18th centuries.
A minister, author, and all-around stuffy dramatic, he orchestrated the devastation that was the Salem witch trials, but he can also be remembered as the first American man who popularized stories of true crime through a written medium.
His most famous work was a collection of crime stories, modestly called...
Pillars of Salt, an history of some criminals executed in this land for capital crimes, with some of their dying speeches collected and published for the warning of such as live in destructive courses of ungodliness,
whereto is added, for the better improvement of this history, a brief discourse about the dreadful justice of God in punishing of sin with sin.
Mather uses several examples of salacious crime, some based in fact and others likely fabricated, in the form of cautionary tales.
Women who murthered their children, men caught committing bestiality, servants murdering their masters with an axe, and a handful of other shocking offenses.
More of the text, however, is concerned with the criminals' monologues and confessions made during the day of their hanging, their expressed regret and final attempts at the mercy of God.
In the text, Cotton also takes a paternal tone, asking about the slippery slope of their sins that led to this final crime, often drunkenness, skipping church, and cursing.
You know the drill.
Mather could, in fact, be called the first American criminologist, a man talking about the criminal's past, where he or she went wrong,
the root of what made him or her deviant enough to commit such a transgression.
Puritans and colonists didn't really care for prisons, preferring capital punishment for serious crimes like murder, rape, or assault,
but also minor crimes like blasphemy, trading with indigenous tribes, being a Quaker, practicing witchcraft, of course, and the theft of any goods,
specifically, for whatever reason, vineyard grapes and neighbor's flowers, and food needed because of hunger.
It says that.
From the 1600s all the way up to the 1900s, tens of thousands could show up for the more salacious executions,
getting shitfaced together, brawling to get the best view,
and stealing pieces of the ropes and scaffolding to hang above their fireplaces,
buying up souvenirs like broadsides containing poems allegedly written by the criminal while he was waiting for his death.
The last public execution in America would come in Kentucky in 1936,
as a black man named Rainy Bethia was convicted of the rape of a 70-year-old white woman,
and it was estimated that 20,000 people came to watch,
reportedly chewing on hot dogs and drinking sodas and beers handed out by the vendors,
heading off after to what one reporter called all-night hanging parties.
It would take up until the second half of the 20th century,
as the progressive movement came into prominence and these public events would disappear,
but at the same time, the most famous men in all of true crime history were starting to seep out from the shadows,
almost begging to be caught by people like you.
The late 1960s through the 1980s saw a surge of serial killings unprecedented in the years before or since,
with its mysterious peak in 1974, known as the Year of Fear.
The year before, law enforcement estimated that there were 89 active serial killers,
but by this Year of Fear, there were estimated to be 109.
Most of us know that our oft-called heavy hitters,
many of which have already graced the haunted halls of American hysteria,
have been boiled down to singular sinister traits.
John Wayne Gacy, our family man, clown murderer of boys,
Ted Bundy, the allegedly handsome man hiding in plain sight,
Jeffrey Dahmer, the outcast cannibal,
son of Sam, the delusional Lover's Lane murderer commanded to kill by a satanic dog.
The media had long known that scary and exciting stories sold like hotcakes,
especially when those hotcakes were presented as salaciously as possible,
covered in thick, bloody strawberry syrup,
no juicy detail left unreported.
But none sold better than the papers that literally inserted you, the reader,
into the story unfolding live.
A momentous event, a chance to be a part of justice with a capital J.
Anyone could be this prerequisite to the internet sleuth,
a breakfast nook detective, if you will.
So there you are, sitting down with your coffee,
trying to crack the code of an uncaught murdering mastermind,
leaving the Sunday crossword untouched.
Search goes on in San Francisco for the man known as the Zodiac Killer.
The elements involved today included psychiatrists,
astrologists, and police guards for school buses.
The Zodiac Killer seems to crave publicity.
The psychotic killer has already murdered five.
The Zodiac loved attention.
He sent out tons of correspondences to law enforcement and the media,
dares that came in the form of codes and ciphers that he wanted the public to try to crack.
The first cipher he sent out to authorities in the press came in three parts,
printed in three different Bay Area newspapers.
Only a handful of days later, it was actually cracked by a history teacher and his wife,
two regular people like you or me.
Though cracking the code did not lead to an arrest,
it did give confidence to investigators that sharing these ciphers with the general public,
involving everyone,
might mean that the collective power of a nation of sleuths could be a good thing after all.
However, of the four puzzles sent, only one has ever been solved for certain.
The final cipher has become an obsession, and just like the JonBenet case,
it spawned endless amounts of content that attempt to crack the code,
the code that many believe will reveal the identity of this uncaught, psychotic genius.
The evil mastermind archetype that we see in horror movies has been fueled a lot by this elusive figure.
But a quick revisit to a couple letters published by the San Francisco Chronicle
paint a slightly different portrait.
In a late June 1970 example,
the Zodiac threatens to blow up a school bus if his demands are not met.
On the back of a card featuring two prospectors riding on a dragon and a donkey
with the phrase of endearment,
quote,
Sorry, your ass is a dragon.
This alleged genius wrote,
If you don't want me to have this blast, you must do two things.
Tell everyone about the bus bomb with all the details.
I would like to see some nice Zodiac buttons wandering about town.
Everyone else has these buttons, like Black Power, Melvin Eats Blubber, etc.
Well, it would cheer me up considerably if I saw a lot of people wearing my button.
Thank you.
And then, not long after, another letter arrived with a slightly different tone.
This is the Zodiac speaking.
I have become very upset with the people of San Fran Bay area.
They have not complied with my wishes for them to wear some nice Zodiac buttons.
No one trait, no one event, can link all of these men together.
But one truth stands alone.
Serial killers are fucking losers.
These correspondences were peeks into the minds of society's most reviled.
And it was around this time that the study of criminology and criminal psychology
began to take up the torch, starting to shirk off those simple categories of an almost biblical good and evil,
looking at their childhoods and early behaviors, their head injuries,
their motives as they related to major life events, their animal killing.
Mining that great mystery of why.
But many in law enforcement felt like all this stuff about criminal minds didn't matter.
These guys were just born pure evil, full stop.
Then they found an ally in a rising movement calling out for the opposite of investigating the childhoods of the criminal
to steer the focus back to the actual victim, the deceased person and their families,
who seemed forgotten then in the long shadow of those that had made them into victims.
In a scene described by one investigator as reminiscent of a weird religious rite,
five persons, including actress Sharon Tate,
were found dead at the home of Miss Tate and her husband, screen director Roman Poliansky.
We all know at least the bones of what would become the Manson family murders.
The drugs, the sex, the unapologetic, almost gleeful carnage acted out against movie star Sharon Tate,
coffee heiress Abigail Folger, Hollywood hairstylist Jay Sebring,
18-year-old Stephen Parent, Leno and Rosemary LaBianca,
the owners of an L.A. grocery store chain,
and Holocaust survivor Wojtek Farkowski.
We've heard the way that these often underage girls left their families,
chasing a dream they didn't understand,
spending years of their life like this,
ending up trapped in bombastic orgies,
shaking with drug addiction, and spaced out beyond repair.
The cultic mind control,
the too radical political and spiritual ideology
that led them to all of this,
that took them out of reality.
We know that on August 8, 1969,
the pregnant Sharon Tate was stabbed 16 times in the stomach
in her mansion in Beverly Hills.
We know the headlines of satanic rituals,
Beatles' race wars,
dune buggies,
abandoned movie sets,
the failed albums of their band,
and the chilling harmonies that the girls sang
as they stood outside the courtroom during Charlie's trial,
their blurry belief in this savior,
their hauntingly dopey eyes.
What many of us don't know, however,
what I didn't know,
is how the aftermath of this outrageous story
and the serial killers of the coming decade
that we just talked about who were waiting in the wings
helped to change everything about criminal justice in America,
as Rachel Monroe writes in her outstanding book,
Savage Appetites.
These crimes hailed in the 1970s
with a rise of a more mainstream feminism,
with new laws designed to protect women
and give them more rights to safety and personal choice.
It goes without saying that this was and is a vital
and overdue revolution around sexual assault
and domestic violence against women,
an approach that included redefining and focusing
on those that had suffered the most
at the hands of abusers and killers,
those who, to this day,
are faced with the very court proceedings
that are supposed to provide healing
but are often emotionally destructive.
But the coming conservative backlash
to these rights claimed by women,
just like in the satanic panic
and with pornography,
we'd see political feminism join forces again
with the right-wing movement of law and order.
Before this, the Kennedy administration
had passed a handful of laws
to ensure rights for defendants facing trial
and limit the powers of law enforcement.
These laws included the required reading
of Miranda rights,
the right to a public defender,
and the law that evidence be obtained
with a search warrant only.
JFK was also taking a more progressive approach
to criminal justice,
attempting to solve issues of poverty
that were believed to lead to crime,
building new opportunities
for low-income inner-city residents
to find scarce work and stay in good schools,
funding education and vocational programs in prisons,
and allowing families to visit inmates.
But running parallel were those lobbying
for the rights of victims,
and giving all of this to offenders
felt like an affront.
As far as this problem of law and order is concerned,
I am for law and order,
Hubert Humphrey is for law and order,
George Wallace is for law and order.
How we would do it would be quite different.
And as far as my program is concerned,
I am the only one of the candidates
who has laid out a precise program
for stopping the rise in crime
and for reestablishing freedom from fear.
That's the difference between Nixon and Wallace.
So Senator Trump was an actress?
Wallace is against, I am for.
That's the difference.
Just seven months after Richard Nixon
was sworn in as president,
the Manson murders would seriously
and sensationally reinforce his staunch law and order platform,
as would the anti-war racial justice movements
raging all over the nation,
and his new favorite battle against the drugs
that were such a visible part
of this inconvenient counterculture.
It was Manson family victim Sharon Tate's mother,
Doris Tate,
a charming suburban grandmother,
frequently described as baking cookies,
who would take up the victim's rights torch
with a fiery vengeance.
As the movement gained serious steam
in the latter half of the 1970s,
at the height of the serial killer hysteria,
L.A. County Deputy District Attorney Stephen Kaye
arrived at Doris's hair salon
with a petition to deny
any of the Manson family members' parole at any time.
This was because,
despite the Manson family's death penalty sentences,
shortly after a California Supreme Court
ruled the death penalty unconstitutional
and replaced it with life in prison
with the possibility of parole.
It was then,
after years of depression and helplessness,
that Doris realized
she was ready to do something more,
something in the name of victims.
Luckily,
there was already a movement going strong
for exactly what Doris was hoping for,
a focus on the victims of crime
rather than the criminals.
Suddenly,
Doris was everywhere,
securing positions
on the board of Citizens for Truth,
Justice for Homicide Victims,
the California Justice Committee,
and Believe the Children,
yes,
the one of recovered satanic ritual abuse fame.
She was on talk shows and radio shows,
rallying for the death penalty
to be upheld in California
for all members of the Manson family
as well as murderers at large.
Victimhood was beginning,
finally,
to also encompass the living left behind
to provide services
for the family members of the deceased
to give them a voice.
And very soon,
Doris Tate would be
the very first person in America
to give a victim's impact statement
during a parole hearing.
And it was for Manson family member
Susan Atkins.
Sharon was sentenced to death
without a fair trial
or without a jury.
I was sentenced to life in prison
without any possibility of parole.
And I say to you,
should Susan Atkins' sentence be any less?
Doris was furious when she found out
that Manson family murderer Tex Watson
had gotten married
and fathered children in prison
and they often came to visit him.
Soon after,
the state would ban
its family visit program
and ban prisoners
from receiving Pell grants,
seriously preventing access
to higher education.
California,
previously at the forefront
of progressive approaches to crime,
would soon have some of the highest
death penalty sentences
in the country.
Without foresight,
this rising movement
was incidentally supporting
the war on crime
and conservative administrations
broadened the archetype
of the criminal
until nuances of crime
began to fade away
and more and more
inner-city black, brown,
and to a lesser degree
poor white people
were incarcerated
at unprecedented rates.
Tough on crime policies
became staples
of both Republican
and Democratic administrations
and policies
like mandatory
minimum sentencing,
two- and three-strike laws
became the new norm
in America,
as we've talked about
many times on our show.
The rhetoric around
victims and criminals
amped up even further
through the 1980s
with Reagan's
Task Force
on Victims of Crime report.
Some of the document
reads in second person,
inserting you,
the reader,
right into the
unfolding horror,
which is more graphic
than I decided
to include here
and smacks of an episode
of Forensic Files.
You are a 50-year-old woman
living alone.
You are asleep one night
when suddenly you awaken
to find a man
standing over you
with a knife at your throat.
As you start to scream,
he beats and cuts you.
He rips out the telephone line,
threatens you again,
and disappears into the night.
True crime has always been
in my blood.
I was one of those
secretly serial killer
obsessed tweens
that scoured the internet
for every detail,
John Wayne Gacy's
childish prison art,
the wild primetime
prison interviews
with Charles Manson
on Geraldo Rivera,
Tom Snyder,
Barbara Walters,
and Charlie Rose,
whose time with Manson
would go on to win
the Emmy for Best Interview.
20 years after my obsession
with serial killers began,
on April 24, 2018,
after 45 years
of avoiding arrest,
a former police officer
who would come to be known
as the Golden State Killer
was apprehended
in Sacramento County,
a man responsible
for at least 13 murders
and at least 50 sexual assaults
between 1973 and 1986,
right in the heart
of the serial killer boom.
Much of the time,
he crawled through the windows
of suburban women
and terrorized his victims
with unimaginable psychological
and physical brutality,
just like Reagan described
in his task force
on Victims of Crime report.
This landmark event,
this cracking of such an old,
cold case,
came at a time
when I was fulfilling
my 13-year-old dream,
writing about true crime
and interviewing those
who worked in the genre
for a podcast,
including the writer
and researcher
who helped finish
the late Michelle McNamara's
beautiful, posthumous book,
All Be Gone in the Dark,
that's now a huge HBO series.
Pat Noswald,
sitting here with the lovely
and intelligent Michelle McNamara,
my wife and creator
of one of the best written
and creepiest crime blogs
on the web.
I just obsessed over it.
What drives me is
the need to put a face
on a unknown killer.
There was some real
deep and intense work
that she did
in terms of benefiting,
you know,
the victims of these crimes
and, you know,
just a bigger sense
of justice in the universe.
So I didn't want the book
to be left undone.
The book was about the man
who she named
the Golden State Killer,
about his victims,
about his crimes,
about the attempts
to find him,
but just as much,
it was about Michelle,
her own obsession,
her own confusion
over why this case
had gotten under her skin
so deeply,
why she kept looking
for justice
right up until
the very day she died.
Just two years
before he'd finally be caught.
I had written an article
for a true crime magazine
that was scheduled
to come out
the day he was arrested,
and we actually had to rush
an addendum between the pages
that made the story
into something suddenly
and entirely different,
unfolding live
at that moment.
It felt like a collective success
for all of us
who poured over evidence
as amateur internet sleuths,
de facto online experts,
trying to carry on the work
that Michelle left behind.
The day the Golden State Killer
was caught
was one of the most exciting
days of my life.
I got to feel like
I was a part of it.
It was very exciting.
The word justice
kept coming up again and again
in the news reports
and press conferences.
And it's true
that that day
the world felt
more balanced.
It felt like there were
consequences
for these horrific actions.
And it didn't just seem like
justice for the victims,
but it felt like justice
for America at large.
Researchers interested
in the human need for
and the experience
of justice
have long studied
and expanded upon
what social psychologist
Melvin J. Lerner
coined
The Justice Motive
in 1981.
The Justice Motive
purports that a communal
structure for justice
evolved alongside
our hunter-gatherer ancestors.
The dominance hierarchy
that was in place
for thousands of years
with the toughest
and meanest
at the top
gave way to a system
that simply worked better
for the survival
of the group.
Our more recent ancestors
lived in communities
that shared important resources
and came together
to reject
in many different ways
those who were
too greedy,
too self-serving,
or just plain dangerous.
Those who broke
the cultural rules
that the group
set in place
to help them thrive
to the best
of their combined ability.
The crimes we've talked
about today,
our worst cultural transgressions,
feel personal
to our giant
national community.
They still feel like
our crimes,
our hometown murders.
And like our
hunter-gatherer ancestors,
we want to join
with the group
to try to identify
those that seek
to harm
our collective health.
As a part
of the justice motive,
psychologists
and sociologists
have also studied
how true crime
reinforces
two cognitive biases.
With what is known
as mean world syndrome,
which is usually explored
in relationship
to the media,
studies have shown
that those who consume
TV news reports
or other media
involving crime
are more likely
to believe
that the world
is by nature
cruel and unforgiving
and that they themselves
will be victimized,
probably soon,
by the rising
criminal class.
Not only that,
but it appears
that the more
of this kind of content
a person watches,
the more likely
they are to support
increases in law enforcement
presence and power,
more willing to support
law and order policies.
And then,
on the flip side,
there's something called
the just world hypothesis.
It's hard to dispute
that most of us
are desperate
to believe
in a kind
of karmic justice,
that what comes around
goes around,
that everything happens
for a reason,
that consequences
will be served
to the bad people
who deserve them,
and blessings
will come to the good.
It's the simple belief
that the world itself,
that the universe,
that God,
that whatever you want
to call it,
is just,
and that justice
will be served
on a cosmic level.
One of the most
vital studies used
in the just world hypothesis
was conducted
by Lerner
in 1965,
and it involved
a group of volunteers
watching a woman
on closed-circuit television
who was allegedly
participating
in a learning test,
but was really
a graduate student
working with Lerner.
She was seated
in a room,
fitted with electrodes,
and asked a handful
of questions.
With each incorrect answer,
the subject would act
as if she'd been shocked.
Her screams were audible,
her body twisting in pain.
One group of volunteers
was allowed a choice,
to transfer her
to a different,
kinder method of learning
without this negative
reinforcement,
without this suffering,
and almost all of them
chose to save her,
identifying her
with words like
innocent victim,
someone who didn't deserve
what was happening to her.
Another group of volunteers,
however,
was not given the option
to save the woman
from the electric shocks,
and they were told
that she was being paid
for her participation
in this learning test.
Interviews with the volunteers
showed that the less money
they were told
she was receiving,
the more they began
to blame her,
saying that she either
wasn't paying enough attention,
wasn't a good learner,
or that the pain
was justified
because she'd become
smarter as a result.
I know it's a little confusing,
but here's what Lerner
concluded from the experiment.
Quote,
The sight of an innocent person
suffering
without the possibility
of reward or compensation
motivated people
to devalue
the attractiveness
of the victim
in order to bring about
a more appropriate fit
between her fate
and her character.
To put it plainly,
those who are victimized
make us uncomfortable
if we're unable
to help them,
and so it becomes
easier to blame the victim
because if the victim
receives no money
or, more broadly,
no justice,
it shakes the foundations
of our belief
in a just world.
We realize the world
can be horrifically random
and that any of us
could be next
with no real way
to expect or prevent it.
And since everything
happens for a reason,
the victim must have
somehow brought this
upon themselves.
In Reagan's task force
on Victims of Crime report,
victims were presented
with words like
innocent and pure
and were, by and large,
white women sexually assaulted
by a stranger at night
or old ladies robbed
at gunpoint
while shopping downtown,
those who are far less likely
to be harmed
and far more likely
to receive justice
than at-risk groups
like sex workers
and drug users
in the unhomed,
those who rarely receive
the title of innocent victim.
Those who subscribe
most strongly
to the just world
are also more likely
to feel negatively
toward oppressed groups
and less likely
to categorize them
as innocent victims,
trying instead
to find reasons
that their treatment
is justified,
unable to face
the discomfort
that the world itself
may not always be just.
Just like those
who believe
in the mean world,
those who believe
in the just world
are also more likely
to support law
and order political leaders
and social institutions
like the police
and prisons
as they exist now.
It's like public hangings,
publicized trials,
true crime investigations,
and even victim blaming
are these dark magic rituals
aimed at restoring
the cosmic order
away from the cosmic chaos.
All the way back
to early colonial life,
where small sins
that held death penalties,
stealing from your neighbor,
blasphemy, witchcraft,
were placed beside murder
and rape,
as if they were crimes
on par with each other.
Whatever you feel
about the correct punishment
for sensational crimes
like serial murder,
the conditions
our cultural monsters
deserve to live in
after their sentencing,
the fact remains
that our prison policies,
aided by the mirage
of rampant true crime events,
have affected all inmates,
many of whom
were there for drug crimes
or robberies.
Folks who,
with the right social programs,
with family visits,
educational opportunities,
financial investment
in communities,
would all be less likely
to become repeat offenders
or to even enter prison
in the first place.
Governor Jerry Brown
was a politician
who pushed
for tough-on-crime legislation
in the 1980s
alongside the victims' rights movement
and Ronald Reagan.
But by the 2000s,
he realized
that it had been a mistake.
Quote,
What we did,
what I did,
we didn't fully grasp
the consequences.
We just didn't know.
And I say it's an error
that should be corrected.
It's important to remember
that true crime
has helped solve cases.
It has brought closure
to families.
It has helped
to get the wrongly accused
out of prison.
It's helped to hold
law enforcement accountable,
to expose huge flaws
within the legal system,
and it's fueled vital changes
in the name
of victims' rights.
But at the same time,
we know so much of it
is exploitive
and horribly insensitive,
like the case
of JonBenet Ramsey
that had no problem
implicating the brother
of a murdered girl
and turning him
into a villain for profit,
unleashing the wave
of often rabid calls
for justice
in what sometimes
starts to feel
like internet
hanging parties.
And the negative effects
of true crime
are ever-present
because it sells
and it always has,
for better or for worse.
As a result,
we're inundated with it
because we want it.
And that cycle
has seriously skewed
our perception of crime
and the potential
for our own
inevitable victimhood.
Rates of violent crime
have been dropping steadily
since the early 90s,
but the majority
of Americans
in poll after poll
believe the exact opposite
and according to true crime,
the threat is constant
and it's coming
to a suburb near you.
A quick glance
at the investigation
discovery lineup
tells us just how frightened
we should be
with shows like
Evil Lives Here,
The Killer Beside Me,
Fear Thy Neighbor,
and of course,
Stranger in My Home.
The root word of victim
comes from the Latin
victima,
meaning sacrificial animal,
And it seems sometimes
that politicians
and our culture
again and again
can sacrifice
our archetypal
American victims
and all of us
who are said
to be future victims
to the gods
of law and order.
And we can even use
past indiscretions,
real or imagined,
to soothe our own fear
that perhaps the universe
does not hand us
our justice.
Instead,
many seek to create
this justice
to find ways
to create a just world
for all of us
in our messy
national community.
We are hardwired
to do this
and that,
at its core,
is a beautiful thing.
But a lot of things
can be wrapped
around our fear,
around our ideas
of justice,
because these ideas
have always been ordered
politically,
socially,
and culturally.
So sometimes
our ritual hope
becomes nothing
but the upholding
of an unjust
status quo
while further cementing
our strict
and dangerous
categories
of us and them,
of good and evil,
of victim
and criminal.
People like Doris Tate,
those actually affected
by sensational
true crime events,
have every motivation
to march headlong
and courageously
into their activism
so that these horrific events
might never happen
to anyone else
ever again.
Then there are people
like Michelle McNamara
and Susan Jameson Bennett,
who became de facto
experts in cases
that had nothing at all
to do with them,
and yet somehow
lived at the center
of their worlds.
All different kinds
of people,
history teachers,
solving,
psychopathic ciphers,
armchair detectives,
internet sleuths,
bloggers and writers
and directors
and podcasters
and journalists,
people like me
and maybe
people like you.
The murder
of JonBenet Ramsey
and its subsequent
investigation
has crystallized
into something
that feels closer
to fiction
than fact.
It's become
a movie of itself.
There are characters,
costumes,
quotes,
there are moments
we know are coming.
We wait for the footage
or we wait for the reenacted moment
where Patsy Ramsey
says through tears
in a televised news report,
we know exactly
the way she says it.
Keep your babies
close to you.
There's someone out there.
If you even occasionally
give in to your sensational side,
you'll have seen
a dozen Patsy Ramseys
say this line.
A dozen John Ramseys
run into the wine cellar
and fall to their knees.
A dozen mysterious,
sinister men
crawl through the window
in the night.
But none of us
have ever met
this little girl,
this family.
And yet,
when the question
of ethics comes up
after a little boy
smashes a fake skull
covered in pigskin,
we have our response.
Doesn't America
deserve an answer?
Maybe the question
really is,
don't we need one?
Standing in the checkout line now,
my items pulled
toward the register
full of cash,
I'm still pulled
toward those tabloids,
beaming her same face
back at me
again and again,
year after year.
And maybe you are, too.
She will always be ours,
John Benet.
She will always belong to us,
an American legend,
a dramatic,
sequined mystery
in full red,
white,
and blue.
This was
American Hysteria.
Next time on the show,
I'll be talking
with the brilliant
Rachel Monroe,
the author of
Savage Appetites,
Four True Stories of Women,
Crime,
and Obsession,
a huge inspiration
for this episode.
Don't miss it.
And then,
join us in two weeks,
the night before the election,
for our long-awaited episode
on fake news.
The nonprofit
we'd like to highlight
for this episode
is called
the Insight Prison Project,
which works to transform
the lives of those
impacted by incarceration
by designing and implementing
rehabilitative programs
designed to develop
emotional and vocational skills
and reduce recidivism.
