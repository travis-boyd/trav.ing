I'm not hearing the echo. Although that would indicate that maybe I'm causing the echo.
It's possible. It's possible.
Is there a way I can change my audio output now? Hold on.
It should be in the top right of Zancaster.
I have to leave and come back. Give me one second.
Okay.
Yeah.
Why'd I say it like that?
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
It's scarves.
Okay. So here's the question.
Yeah.
Did this end the echo?
Let's find out. Liam, screaming.
I think we're okay.
I think we're good.
Cool. Okay.
I'm wearing the world's shittiest headphones.
I'm so sorry.
Liam, you sounded like Milkshake when he decided to sleep on the table behind my chair,
and I leaned back and I squashed his tail.
Aw.
Aw, you fucker.
Congratulations. You're going to the Hague.
Guess what he's doing right now is the same thing with his tail on the table.
You're going to Gulag.
At like three minutes nineteen into the Zancaster recording, I've started my local recording.
Oh shit, do you want that from me too?
It would be nice, yeah, as a backup.
Okay, I got it. I gotcha.
You wanna clap or whatever?
No.
I mean, we may as well.
Probably wouldn't hurt to get into the Havit.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm recording now.
Everyone's going?
Alright, so Justin, what you're gonna want to do is count down three, two, one, Mark,
and when you say Mark, we clap.
Okay.
Three, two, one, Mark.
Beautiful.
Close enough.
Felt like viscerally wrong, the wrong podcast feeling, having that happen.
I'm used to this one not being that organized.
Hello comrades, and welcome to Workers and Resources, Soviet Republic.
Have you ever played this game?
It's a Soviet Republic about workers.
And resources.
Yeah, have you ever heard of this game?
Justin, have you heard of this?
It's called Workers and Resources, Soviet Republic.
It's just out in 1.0.
Have you heard of it?
I'm Justin Rosniak, I'm the Minister of Transportation, my pronouns are he and him.
Okay, go.
I am November Kelly, I am the like, Minister of Internal Troops, and my pronouns are she
and her.
Yay, Liam.
You can just say secret police.
Yeah, I like to put a gloss on it, you know.
Yeah.
Hi, I'm Liam McAnderson, and I am inside your walls.
And we have a guest.
Hi, I'm Victoria Scott, my pronouns are she and her.
I don't know what my job is, I wasn't told I needed to have one.
Did I say my pronouns?
No, you didn't.
I don't think you did.
No, you did.
We have to just refer to you as Liam.
Yeah.
My pronouns are Liam Liam, yeah.
Liam Liam.
Yep.
Yeah, so I thought for a bonus episode, we would do our single least researched one
yet, and that's saying something.
I don't know about that.
We've done some pretty threadbare episodes.
I don't know, I don't know.
Like, as a kind of denizen of the, uh, my podcast is a machine that turns Wikipedia articles into content.
Jesus Christ, go about that.
This is...
I at least go into the sources for the Wikipedia articles.
You do that.
You do that.
I don't.
Um, this is why the, like, Justin episodes are like, heavier hissing, is because you do research.
Sometimes I even read a book.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know if you read, like, The Box, and then you read Cadillac Desert.
Yeah.
So that's like two, at least.
Um, but yeah, no, the thing is, I've been stupidly busy, and so ultimately what I thought
I would do was contrive an excuse to hang out with my friends and co-workers.
And, uh, so we're doing a bonus episode that I've loosely titled, uh, like, Cars Under Communism.
We have a bunch of, like, pre-communist ones, so it's just, I guess, kind of like, Eastern European cars,
especially because we didn't mention any Chinese ones.
Um, so...
I mean, I could just do that off the dome, too.
I put a Chinese car in.
It's not a car.
Legally, it's not a car.
Unless you're John Forrester, who, you know, would have fit in very well, I think, in that sort
of era of Chinese history.
Oh, that's true, yeah.
But yeah, so I've put together some slides with a lot of cars, uh, some of them I know stuff about,
some of them Victoria knows stuff about, uh, but in general we're just gonna be taking a look,
having a chat, and, uh, it's too long- ah, fucking hell.
It's two dollars a month.
So, you know.
Yeah, Nova told me that we were gonna be talking about stupid cars, and I was like,
yeah, of course.
I've written articles about, like, a handful of these.
Yeah.
What's the worst that could happen?
Absolutely.
So, with that in mind, um, next slide, please.
Alright.
Alright, I wrote a slide.
This is gonna be exquisitely researched, and then the rest of it is like...
Seriously, there's like, I'm scrolling through the notes, there's like paragraphs of notes,
and then you go to the, like, you know, a few down, and you've got like, this is an car.
I took a lot of this from one Jalopnik article, which is what was it like to buy and own a car
in the USSR.
Um...
Really annoying, I imagine.
Yeah.
It was very annoying, but, you know, here's the situation, right?
You're in the Soviet Union.
You are the new Soviet man.
Oh god, I hope not.
Yeah, well, you could be the new Soviet woman.
Um, you know, you live in something called a micro-district, like this.
This is in the south of Warsaw, right?
Uh-huh.
You know, there's a bunch of apartment buildings, and then you got shops, and you got schools,
and you got...
All this crap is all within...
You got all the workers and resources, yeah.
Yeah, exactly.
You got the workers, you got the resources, what else do you need, right?
Um, you know, you have an apartment, which is
bigger and much cheaper than most apartments Americans will have it in 2024.
Um...
Have you ever seen the bit in the DDR museum in Berlin, where they're like, under communism,
they forced you to live in an apartment, and they get really mad at you when you look at the apartment
and go, this is nicer than my apartment now.
This is much nicer.
Yeah.
There's sink works, I bet.
Yeah.
You probably even have a dacha, which is a summer house, but Russian, right?
But you want more.
You want a car, because you're doing aspirationalism.
Um...
Oh, boy.
Yeah, exactly.
Well...
You're about to destroy communism.
Yeah.
You're lighting a big bomb with like a 40-year fuse.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
So, probably one, there's no car dealers.
You can't go to a car dealer and buy the car.
Well, yeah, they had to get rid of all those, because that's where all the fascism is concentrated.
That's where that's the fascism factory at car dealerships.
Yeah.
It's only the third time in my life, I will say, happily, the Soviets got it right.
Death to the dealership.
Yeah.
You have to apply for a car through your job, or more precisely, through your trade union.
Nice.
Decisions about how many cars are allocated to each trade union are made from above, right?
So, if you work at the university, your trade union might get three cars a year.
If you work at the steel mill, you might get six cars a year, so on and so forth.
A lot of this is based on political favors, right?
This is the greatest system of government in human history.
Yeah.
I'm barely even joking.
Yeah.
I'm barely even joking.
Now, the car, despite it being, you know, communism, right?
You know, money's not supposed to matter that much.
The car is expensive, right?
You got to save your rubles because Kopex won't do.
Mm-hmm.
Um, a lot of these cars cost something like one to two years of wages, and that was at
the low end.
So, if you're just some guy, a lot of people would take priority in getting a car ahead
of you.
If you wanted a car fast, you needed to be like an upstanding member of the Communist
Party and like a Stuckhanovite, you know, all that sort of stuff.
You know, you had to be like at the, you had to be the most productive worker at the
factory.
You had to be able to hit the piece of steel with the mallet better than anyone else, right?
Um, then you could apply to purchase a car which would be delivered in five to seven years.
I, as a decarbonization measure, we have to go back.
Um, yeah.
I mean, yeah, that's the thing.
So anyway, you've grown a few gray hairs, but you finally have your brand new car.
Woo!
Thank you!
You get it in the driveway, one of the doors falls off.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh, it's, it's whatever car that the trade union was allocated and it's in whatever color
the manufacturer decided to paint it that day.
Oh, it's a British race of green.
I mean, to be fair, that is how buying a car in America currently works.
Have you seen how it's got to get it?
That is kind of true.
Have you seen dealerships lately?
Uh, you can have it in any color you want as long as it's gray.
I want it in British racing green.
Excuse me, silver.
Um, now you have two problems.
Number one is that there's no gas stations.
Number two, there's no parking.
I solved problem one, my summer car style, or like the long drive style,
by keeping four jerry cans full of kerosene in the boot of my car.
I mean, yeah, I mean...
Oh, that's a plus crash worthiness there.
Yeah.
I mean, a lot of times, yeah, that is sort of what you'd have to do.
I mean, the big, uh, the gas station problem, they're just scarce.
They don't like not exist, right?
But finding gas is difficult.
Um, you know, but problem number two, to solve problem number two, no parking,
you rent a garage, which is usually on the outskirts of town.
So when you wanted to drive your car, first you had to take a trolley bus,
and it was usually a trolley bus, to the garage,
and then you could drive somewhere from there.
And that, that place you were driving to,
you probably also could have gotten to on the trolley bus.
Driving should still be like this.
It should be like this everywhere.
Yeah.
And then maybe when you get there, you might be able to park it,
and then you do something at the place you were going to,
and when you get back, someone has stolen the windshield wipers.
Oh, those assholes.
Yeah, if you're lucky.
If you're lucky, they only steal the windshield wipers.
Oh, of course.
Of course.
There's a very robust black market for car parts.
Um, you know, so people stole parts off of cars all the time if they were parked on the street.
So just, just as a side, as an aside here, I know probably half a dozen to a dozen auto journalists
who live in New York City who do exactly this.
They literally have like warehouses in Jersey that they take an hour and a half train ride to
to go drive their cars.
Under the communist rule of Eric Adams.
Yeah.
New York City really is the Zagreb of America.
First he solved the garbage can problem, and then he eliminated cars.
Yeah.
He's played workers and resources Soviet republicans very slowly,
through gradualism, making New York City into a Soviet republic.
Sadly, Kathy Hochul has decided that she is going to go to war with the forces of Eric Adams.
Yeah.
Critical support for Eric Adams.
And his army of NYPD robot dogs.
Against the left deviationists in Albany.
So, in practice, in practice, if you owned a car in the Soviet Union,
you used your car to drive for the Dacia on the weekends and not much else, right?
Uh, most people never even took their cars out in winter, because the road salt is gnarly,
and they're not getting a new car anytime soon.
Uh, there was almost no used car market, and a lot of times used cars were more expensive than
new cars, because, well, you could get those instantly if you could pay for them.
Again, we have to do degrowth, right?
We gotta do it.
You gotta have an extremely robust public transport system that makes you an
asshole for trying to drive a car.
Yes.
I like my job, though.
Mm, yeah, but you'll be allocated a new one, you know?
As a new Soviet woman.
I don't even get allocated a new one now.
I don't currently own a car.
Although, that may change this weekend.
Who thought is that?
Put the call out now, give Victoria a car.
If you have a car, you don't need it, give it to her.
Yeah, give Victoria all your cars.
Mm.
All of them?
Yeah.
Preference given to 91 to 95 Acura NSXs.
All the supplies in the Soviet Union.
If you're in China, there's a different situation.
Uh, you get one of these.
Yeah, a flying pigeon.
A flying pigeon, yeah.
It's a one-speed bicycle, it's the most produced bicycle ever by several orders of magnitude.
I really want one.
Yeah, they don't sell them outside of- they still make them in China for nostalgia.
Um, and they don't export them because, as I've read from people who have owned them,
they're terrible.
Like, this isn't a Kalashnikov kind of situation where you're like,
oh, this is like the standard because it's like very robust and it's good, right?
It's just like Spartan.
No, no.
These apparently, by all accounts, suck to raids.
I think like 20 of them-
Yeah, Ross wants one anyway.
Yeah, I want one anyway.
I mean, apparently, like 20 of them got exported to the United States, but they're all in Berkeley.
Ugh.
I'm not going to now.
Yeah, I'm gonna go to Berkeley.
Um, terrible seat, I'm informed.
I'm reading.
It looks like a terrible seat.
This is like a little piece of leather, you know, like, riveted down on each side.
Horrible.
Yeah, democratizing like movement, I guess.
It's this and the Honda Super Cub, you know?
Yeah.
Everyone gets a shitty bicycle.
That's something they don't have in the video game, workers and resources.
Soviet Republic is a bicycle.
If they put bicycles in that game, city planning would be so much easier.
Bicycle DLC, please.
Yes.
I'm not even joking.
She's not even joking.
I'm not even joking.
Not even joking.
Alright, next slide?
Yes.
Alright, so this-
Wow!
Anyway, let's talk about cars.
I wanted to go in with a cool one.
So this is Lennon's car.
It wasn't his originally, it was the Tsar's.
So there was this-
And then what happened?
Well, exactly, right.
So he got his ass, got.
This is the kind of royal-
Remember the Disney film Anastasia?
Technically-
Not a Disney film, it's a Don Blitz film.
It is now.
It is now.
I regret to inform you that my wife's favorite movie as a kid was Anastasia.
Mine too!
What the fuck?
Yeah, no-
Oh, thank god.
No, genuinely.
Some of the first stirrings of gender being like, what?
What's going on here?
Anyway, this is a converted Rolls Royce- I want to say Silver Ghost, but don't quote me on that.
There was this guy called Kegress who had invented the Kegress system, which is this thing here.
It's not like a tread, like a tank tread.
It's one continuous, like, big rubber band, essentially.
And the idea is just you get more grip on, like, snow and ice.
And so there was this plant in Petrograd, as it then was, that was converting these,
like, converted cars into, like, half tracks like this.
They did one for the Tsar, the Tsar got got, then it was Lenin's car.
It's still in a museum in St. Petersburg, I believe, and I think it looks fucking great.
It's like a great piece of retrofuturism.
Very Dishonored.
Oh yeah.
Great game, by the way.
Oh, I love that game.
Yes.
Next slide, please.
Okay, I think this one's mine.
Um, so the-
I think the most famous car, probably to come out of the, like, central part of the Soviet Union, was Gaz.
Because they built basically every car.
Gorky Automobile Works.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What a name.
Um, and so-
The problem with this is, sorry to keep interrupting, there were like five hundred thousand different car factories,
all of which are named, like, Gaz, or Vaz, or Waz, or whatever, and it's usually just, like,
City Automobilnizavod, like, Automobile Plant.
And they all had different designs, they all had different production lines,
and it's very annoying to keep track of.
This will come up later.
Oh, boy.
Yeah.
Yeah, but this one was early.
Uh, so this was actually, as you can tell here, we have two very similar looking cars.
Um, the one on the left here is a Gaz.
The one on the right is a Ford.
Uh, so this was actually, Gaz was originally a collaboration with Ford.
They were, Russians were importing, like, Fords as, like, build-at-home kits as early as, like, 1909.
Um, and the- basically, I was curious about why this would be- why they would be doing this,
because, like, Henry Ford was, you know, a rabid anti-communist and hated basically everything about
the Soviet Union.
And Jews!
But the answer was just because, like-
Yeah, well, the answer was just like, oh, they have money, and boy, do I love money.
It was the Mr. Crabb sales strategy.
Money, money, money, money.
Um...
Not just limited to Ford, by the way.
Like, a bunch of American corporations built stuff like oil refineries, uh, and, like,
factories, production lines, whatever, all over the Soviet Union, um, under this program.
Yeah, so, when Lenin was alive-
So, famously, the, uh, the Milwaukee roads, uh, Little Joe electric locomotives were built
for the Soviet Union, and then- and then that export got cancelled.
Yeah.
For political reasons.
Yeah, literally, they built them, like, in the five-year window, where it looked like
the U.S. and the Soviets were gonna have, like, close relations after World War II, and then
that didn't happen.
So then the Milwaukee road won them for, like, five dollars, and then managed to
give us a glimpse at a timeline where the world didn't suck.
A cool one, yeah.
Yeah.
All the crews were confused because everything was labeled in Russian.
Um, yeah, the- so, Lenin's idea was that if you can't make something, you import it.
And, of course, Stalin was like, no, uh, we have to make literally everything here in
the Soviet Union, and we can never import anything from anywhere else.
So, uh, in-
Yeah, they're gonna find out there were communists over here, and then they're gonna
cut off the import.
Yeah, I mean, so, uh, in- in the, um, in the late 20s, they started looking at ways to start
producing cars domestically.
Um, in 1929, they assigned collaboration paperwork to build the Gorky automobile plant.
Um, and it was basically, you're gonna buy 72,000 car parts, bare minimum, and in exchange,
we'll give you some patents, we'll give you design tips.
Uh, Ford's Albert Kahn, uh, would come in and design some stuff.
They designed- he designed, like, a Stalingrad tractor plant, too.
Um, the mood for this was, uh, according to New York Times correspondent Anne O'Hare McCormick
in 1927.
The word for industrialization in Russia is Americanization, and the passion to Fordize
the Soviet Union is even stronger than the passion to communize it.
Um, that did not age great.
Oh, boy.
Oh, that's not tasty.
I like the idea that they were giving them design tips, like, there's a Ford- there's
a Ford engineer in there, and he's like, alright, so-
You guys ever heard of a fucking wind tunnel?
Jesus Christ!
Here's a real- here's a real pro tip.
This is insider info.
So, your car should have four wheels.
The Prima Games strategy guide on how to make a car.
My favorite part of this-
Yeah, there's a bunch of people scribbling down notes.
So, the Ford- the Ford here is the Model A, and the Gaz here is like the Gaz A. Um, they-
so they just didn't even change the name.
The funniest part of this to me is that the Gaz has a convertible top, and the Ford had
a hard top by this point.
No, no, no, no, no.
My answer's not again.
So, I imagine that the Russians could not crack hard top technology yet.
Like, the Ford wasn't willing to share that with them.
Mm-hmm.
Um, but yeah, by 1932, the Gorky plant was, uh, running and operational, and they were building
model AA trucks, and they- the Gaz AA, uh, which was, you know, a heavy industry truck,
and then they were building these cars.
And then, next slide, please.
There's a bunch of other stuff that happened, but really, the biggest kind of development
was like the Gaz M1.
This was a very- I think we lost Nova.
Uh-oh, did we?
Yeah, it looks like she just disappeared.
Uh-oh, went all blind.
I have some thoughts about my internet service provider, and I-
Wait, wait, make sure we're recording, please.
Yes, we are.
Go.
Go, go.
Tell us about them.
I would like to visit them at their offices to communicate to them the urgency of having
internet connection on a consistent basis for my work.
I would like to communicate that to them with a series of methods, which I am here gonna go
into detail about.
First of all-
That's interfering with international commerce.
That's right, that's right.
I think that there should be drone strikes.
We're gonna get the US State Department on this.
I'm gonna join the Foreign Service and sanction them.
I'm gonna join the National Clandestine Service, and I'm gonna do things to their families.
I-
Hit them with it, Nova.
I'm gonna do things to their families.
Okay, are we good?
Are we back?
Are we fucking-
Are we so fucking back?
Are we unburdened by what's come before?
Alright, where did we get up to?
Uh, I was talking about the Gaz M1.
Oh, that's fucking sick.
This was like-
Yeah, this was like the-
This was the iconic, like, Great Patriotic War car.
Um, they built-
So, during the Great Patriotic War, uh, Gaz built 10,000 tanks and 100,000 cars, which is
isn't bad for a factory that was established, like, a decade before.
The civil-military distinction there is crazy, and they needed way more tanks than that.
Yeah, the thing that's hilarious to me is that they also built an NKVD variant of this specific car,
that they just took a Ford V8, like, straight out of a crate, and just plopped it into this.
Um, during the Great Patriotic War, they pulled the motors from the NKVD's pursuit cars to put in T60 tanks.
Sorry, we took the engine out of your super cool spy car or whatever, because there was a war on.
I was about to say.
Yeah, uh, I should also note that my fiance has insisted that I call it the Great Patriotic War every single time I refer to it.
Uh, get the Soviet Blues Brothers getting this car, it's like, it's got cop shops, cop suspension.
No cop motor, though. No motor at all.
Oh, it's an AirCore V-20. Oh, have fun!
It's a V-0.
Um, yeah.
And then they, you know, they run some guys off a bridge, because they hate German Nazis, you know, regular Nazis, actually.
So, uh, next slide, please.
Ooh, a Chaika.
Yeah, so this is, so the millionth car that Gaz made was built in 1948.
So, not even two decades after they first built the plant.
Wait, 1948?
Yeah, when Ford gave them the, like, Prima Games strategy guide on industrialization, they really read that shit.
That's wild.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um, so this specific car is actually, uh, Khrushchev's personal Gaz Chaika.
Um, and this was, so this was like a very, uh, high-end, you know, limousine-esque kind of car that was intended to mimic an American style, which is why you get, like, all this big chrome, the bullet bumper.
The tail fins.
The tail fins.
Um, the thing is, is like, because of that five to seven year wait to get a car and the fact that it's not, like, there's no need to compete with, like, anyone internally.
Cars didn't get updated for 10 or 15 or 20 years.
And so this car that's Khrushchev's, uh, was, like, a 1962.
Um, and it's designed like it's a mid-50s Packard.
Like, by this point, like, tail fins were gone, uh, bullet bumpers were gone, chrome was way gone in, like, American cars, and they were still building this that looked like a mid-50s at best kind of American car.
Yeah, it's perfect.
Which I think is...
It works.
You're not doing the thing that we talked about on the Edsel episode of releasing, like, a new car every year.
Yeah, yeah.
So, I mean...
In the Soviet Union, every vehicle is a fleet vehicle.
Yeah, basically.
Yeah, so, I mean, I like...
Very efficient.
This one is actually at the Peterson Museum in Los Angeles.
I saw it in their basement collection where they have a bunch of, like, cars from dictators.
Uh, so the car directly in front of it here is actually Saddam Hussein's Mercedes.
Saddam Hussein.
Fuck.
Yeah.
It was an educated guess about a Mercedes, you know?
Yeah, there's also, uh, a Pope...
One of the Pope's, uh, Cadillac Popemobiles behind it.
I guess the Pope is a dictator of Vatican City.
Yeah, I guess, technically, yeah.
Well, I've been here.
I've been to the Peterson Museum.
It rules.
I want to see Khrushchev's car.
I highly recommend it.
Um, yeah, so, next slide, please.
So, Gaz's most famous line was probably the Volga, which was, like, kind of...
It was a taxi, so, you know, it kind of got, like, Crown Vic status.
Also, diplomats used them, police used them, the KGB used them.
Um, it was basically...
This, the one that looked like this was produced from, basically, 1956 to 1970.
Uh, almost entirely with a 2.4 liter straight four.
It's, it's, it's the car.
It's the car that there is.
It's the fleet vehicle.
Yeah, it's...
This is, this is the Soviet Union Crown Vic.
Uh, next slide, please.
God, what a great comparison.
This is the one that I'm obsessed with, though.
So, this is the, uh, Volga 2.4-2.4, uh, which is a variant of, like, the 2.4-2.0.
This was the post-facelift version that came about.
I think they started building these sometime in, like, 72 or 75, something like that.
Mm.
Um, so, obviously, it looks more like a 60s Dodge Dart or Falcon now.
You know, it's, like, been updated.
But the part of this that is interesting to me is...
I see, I see what you're highlighting in the notes.
There's a lot of...
Um, so, the thing that's fun about the 2.4-2.4 is that the, um, the KGB got pursuit variants
that got a, a 200 horsepower V8 swapped out of one of the Chaikas.
Who the fuck were they pursuing?
Who could they possibly...
What counter-revolution?
Everyone was taking the fucking bus.
I...
Yeah, they were, they were, they were pursuing...
No, no, we need to pursue a bus.
...Alexandr Solzhenitsyn on the bus.
Yeah, you wanna see speed, Alex?
I just, I wanna know what kind of comrade detective shit they envisioned doing.
That they're like, we need the, like, uh...
We need the pursuit.
Well, okay, to be fair, these were, like, very agricultural V8s, because they didn't have,
like, a, you know, they didn't have Mopar for gas.
Mm.
Um, and so, like, this car did a 15 second 0-60.
Um, which...
The fucking KGB are gaining on us.
Actually, I imagine it might be quite sinister.
Like, all of these, especially in black and at night, look sinister as fuck, so...
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, um, so, like, in comparison to 70 Chevelle SS, which is kind of, like, peak American horsepower,
uh, 454 cubic inch V8, God's perfect automobile, could do a 0-60...
There's no replacement for displacement.
It could do 0-60 in, like, around six seconds on very early, very, very early, like, uh, tubeless tires, uh, in 1970.
So, you know, you could basically smoke this with, like, a minivan.
The minivans didn't exist yet, but, like, a station wagon.
Mm.
This is for pursuing anti-capitalist hooners.
You know?
Yeah.
Uh, and on a real...
Oh, funny, I do drift in street in shape of American dollar sign.
Am I allowed to mention the last...
Yeah, go for it.
Go for it.
It's a bonus.
Um, yeah, so the thing that's interesting is that I've seen some of these for sale.
I saw one that was purportedly an original KGB car.
It had the V8 in it, and I swear to Christ, it had, like, hard points in the trunk.
And I desperately tried to find the listing for it for this episode.
It's just for, like, mounting stuff.
Don't worry about it.
The listing said, oh, it's got hard points for mounting radio gear.
Yeah.
And I'm like, yeah, sure it is, buddy.
It was not a hard point for mounting radio gear.
Kicking around in the trunk.
I have not stopped thinking about this for, like, three years.
I have been so normal about the idea of this.
Um, anyway, I just, I've...
Ever since then, I've been interested in these cars.
It's good.
If you're an attractive woman who happens to own a 70s gas Volga with hard points in the trunk,
please send me a DM.
Evidently, they worked, because I've never heard of any anti-capitalist hooning.
Yeah, absolutely.
You mean anti-communist?
Or anti-communist, excuse me.
Yeah.
Good luck.
I got my ideologies all messed up.
It's okay.
We are talking about cars, which is pretty...
I've become the median American voter.
You've become burdened by what has come before.
Oh, God.
I can't believe I'm going to have to...
We have to do this episode with no news section when there's been so much news.
There's so much news.
Yeah, we're sorry.
People keep shitting on us for it, and I'm just like, I'm sorry.
I was worried about recording all these episodes so close together, but luckily, as our friend
VL Lennon said, or VI Lennon said, you know, this is one of those weeks where decades happen.
My Australian friend VB Lennon.
VB Lennon.
VB Lennon.
Next slide, please.
So the other thing I would talk about, just in relation to the Chaika, is one of the companies
that did a lot of the Soviet limousines was Zyl, which is the Lykachev automobile plant.
And this is Stalin's car.
This is a Zys 115.
And it's exactly the same thing, but earlier, of this is a Packard, right?
Sort of out of time.
But you may notice that it's extremely overbuilt and heavy.
I like looking at the tires.
The windows, three inches thick, just in case anybody tries to take a shot at, like, Uncle Joe.
They have to open them hydraulically, which is weird that they open at all.
Just in case someone wants to take a shot at Uncle Joe.
And, you know, he repels it with sheer force of will.
He's the man of steel.
I don't know if there actually were any serious attempts to assassinate Stalin, is the thing.
Like, unless I'm badly forgetting.
I mean...
But I guess, like, you know, paranoia dies hard.
And, like, when we talk about the Olympics having Zyl lanes, it's because of, like, cars
like this, right?
They made...
That's the problem.
He never got...
No one ever tried to assassinate him, so he just kept getting more and more paranoid.
He needed, like, that release of an assassination attempt.
This is what happened to Trump.
He would have been fine.
This is genuinely what happened to...
We're going to have to talk about it at some point.
Hit the big Stalin assassination paranoia reset counter in his brain.
Alright, next slide, please.
So, you're the Soviet Union, you've won the war, and you want to create a car for your
kind of, like, burgeoning middle class, or the burgeoning middle class you hope to exist.
Right?
And so, what Gaz creates is this, the pobeda, the victory.
It was originally going to be called the Rodina, the motherland, and Stalin, there's a kind
of semi-apocryphal story that he kind of put a stop to this with the heavy implication
of having people gulagged, because they pitched this to him and he's like, oh, how much does
the motherland cost?
And everybody sort of, like, very quickly went back and changed the name.
This is...
They made this under license in Poland as well as the Warszawa, and there will be a lot of
Polish content in this as well, because, like, a lot of the Soviet satellite states had their
own car industries.
A lot of the time it was some of the only, like, export products that they made.
And although, maybe quality-wise, you're looking at, like, Skoda in Czechoslovakia for, like,
the best...
Poles made some of the best-looking cars under communism, so I'm going to be talking about
them a fair amount.
This car has a very startled-looking face.
Yeah, it's alarming, right?
Yeah.
This is sort of post-Facelift.
The original grill used to have much more, like, horizontal elements, and it used to colloquially
be called a telnyashka, like a striped vest, like on a military uniform.
And yeah, these are, like...
People sort of like them in the sense that they're reliable, but, you know, undemanding mechanically,
it's going to be a theme.
The visibility out the back is fucking terrible.
In particular because it uses an early form of toughened glass called, I shit you not,
Stalinite, that warps crazy easily.
And so you get a kind of, like, magic mirror effect looking out of the back.
But like, in general, this is your kind of, like, middle-range, aspirational people's
car.
It's still better than what the Swedes are doing right now, when they just got rid of the
rear window entirely.
Yeah, no, this is...
The thing is, this is fine.
For the time that it is, for what it's meant to be, this is fine.
The most interesting thing about this image is, like, I have no familiarity with this car,
because I just...
I have not heard of it until Nova mentioned it.
I can't tell what size it is.
It looks like it could be either the size of a Honda Civic or, like, a Buick Roadmaster.
I genuinely don't know.
It's pretty small, I believe.
The other thing...
I want to believe it's the size of a Buick Roadmaster, even though I know it's not.
It's small, but it's actually weirdly heavy.
Like, one of the biggest complaints about it is that the, like, trunk boot lid wears out,
the hinges wear out, because of how much weight you're having to put on them every time.
Oh, wow.
This is, like, it's, like, all metal, like, monocoque designs.
The first one built entirely in the Soviet Union out of a Soviet design.
And it's built off of, like...
The prototype is done off of, like, wooden...
I forget the term for it, but when you build, like, a big wooden kind of, like, baffled model,
and then sort of shape the paneling over that, it was built over, like, a wood frame.
But the wood frame warped.
So in the course of making it, like, up until the first second of these running onto the production line,
you're constantly having to, like, panel beat these things to make sure that it fits.
And it means that, like a Cybertruck, right, none of the, like, panels join together very well.
You can kind of, like, you can see daylight through the doors and stuff.
Oh dear.
Oh no.
Um.
But yeah, this is, it's, like, very successful for what it is.
But if you can't afford a Poveda, a victory, what you can get instead is- next slide please-
Um.
A-
The defeat.
Yeah.
Essentially, yes.
This is a- I'm gonna butcher my pronunciation.
This is a Zapparajets.
So happy to see you!
And a Zapparajets, a different company, another one of the, like, 50 Soviet car manufacturers,
and they exclusively made the kind of, like, cheap, low range, like, microcars.
Um, and this was your, like, everyman car in practice.
You just had to wait, like, five years to get one, right?
And you still had to have pull.
But, like, it's something that, like, normal person-
You better be in good standing with the Communist Party.
You better show up all the meetings.
Mm-hmm.
Um, you know, maybe you run one or two.
This is rear-engined, right?
I believe so, yeah.
Because it's got those scoops at the back.
I like how they managed to still put a fake grill on it.
It still falls into early EV design language patterns.
It doesn't need that front grill at all.
Yeah.
Does it have a frunk?
I actually don't know.
Hold on, I'm gonna look this up right now.
But yeah, it was meant to be, like, the Soviet Beetle.
Um, and yeah, it is rear-engined, so it will have a frunk, yes.
That was Pete Besky.
Mm.
Um, yeah.
There's- there's a- just as an example of, like, a sort of snapshot of the Soviet Union
post-war, right?
Um, one of the things that made this the people's car was that it was very readily adapted for
people who were missing one or both legs.
Um, they made, like, special editions of this for people who had, like, lost limbs in the war.
Um, purely because that was such a large segment of, like, the adult population of the Soviet
Union at this point.
Mm.
Um, but yeah, this is, like, your sort of cheap, dirty, uh, like, shitbox.
Um, and I think it's actually very cute for what it is, you know?
Oh, especially in this color, it's nice.
Yeah.
Um.
I like how this one comes with no mirrors at all.
Well, as far as features go, and how they got it this cheap, and how they managed to
make this, like, the cheapest car you could get, uh, if we got a next slide, um, one of
the upgrades that they did-
This is the inside, yeah.
Optimistic to have the speedometer go to 120km an hour.
Um, one of the things that they did to make it more, like, luxury, one of the kind of,
like, trim levels in between, um, like, upgrades was putting in safety glass for the first
time, so you're Stalinite, um, so you could see a kind of, like, wavy image through the
windscreen instead of just having it kill you instantly.
And replacing this dashboard, which is made of metal.
Um.
Oh!
I love- I love bare metal dashboards so much.
Me too.
Also, the scene from Dr. No, god damn.
You can see also the, like, steering column that impales you through the sternum as well.
This is like-
I mean, that was pretty typical.
Oh yeah, absolutely.
Um.
That's just- that's just good old fashioned American ingenuity right there.
You can see over here, oh my god, you have to put it in H!
It kind of is that you have to put it in H car.
And they made a bunch of Zaprogettes, um, all of the same kind of thing, right?
Um, you have, like, a kind of, uh, tiny little engine, and, um, weirdly, one thing that's,
um, also really common in these, like, early cars is suicide doors.
That- if you don't know what a suicide door is, it's a door that hinges on the, like, the
wrong side for a car door, so you, uh, you open it and, like, the front hinges out rather
than the back.
Um.
Uh.
Which is deadly in the sense that if it fails in any way mechanically, the door gets ripped
open and you get flung to your death.
Um, this was-
I wonder if anyone ever used, like, this portion of the speedometer.
No.
Just very, very optimistically, you know?
Yeah.
That's very optimistic numbers right there.
Oh, by the way, uh, just, uh, they did eventually take off the fake grill, um, and replace it
with just some, like, nice horizontal chrome.
Um.
But yeah, it's insanely loud, stupidly slow, and it kills you instantly.
Zaprogettes!
Um.
Next slide, please.
Sounds great.
Sorry, I had to run off to go take my anxiety pills this week of beer.
Saluting.
Um.
This is also a vulgar.
Smart.
We talked about the vulgar.
This is the...
Oh, this thing looks terrific.
It's fucking great, right?
Like, a lot of the external design of these things really, like, pops off.
Um, this is the last, I believe...
Sort of a...
It's like, understated, like, uh, you know, that certain era of, like, luxury Mercedes-Benz's.
Mm.
Yeah, the car you get murdered in, yeah.
It's...
Well...
The car that someone comes in to kill you, yeah.
Yeah, this also probably has, like, hard points in the back.
Um, but the thing is, um, this was, as far as I know, the last sort of generation of vulgars
they made in the Soviet Union.
There were, like, some Russian ones, there still are.
Um, but this one, uh, when it was first, like, launched in 82, um, they looked at the
prototype, and they were like, this is too good.
Um.
Like...
It's aspirationalistic.
Yeah, it was gonna replace the vulgar with the hard points that we saw, right?
But, um, part of the reason is that, like, it's not very, like, economic fuel, but it's
also, um, like, the engine's too good, it's too nice.
And so, what the sort of, like, planned economy of the Soviet Union did was go, you can't sell
these to, like, people.
Right?
These have to be, like, cop cars and taxis exclusively for the first, like, ten years.
Um, and so, what was actually, like, quite an innovative design at the time, they had
a weird ignition thing, um, just kind of, like, stagnated, and this is gonna be a recurring
theme, uh, kind of, like, withered on the vine, because it was only being used by cops and taxi
drivers.
Um, because, like, they didn't want to waste the resources, and it didn't make sense economically,
under the system, to, like, put out the new vulgar for, like, um, you know, even kind
of, like, aging, uh, like, bureaucrats.
At that point, they had just given up, right?
Yeah, I mean...
Like, 82!
I mean, that's like, that's like, that's like the Blazer EV coming out today.
Yeah.
It's like, eh, this is late Empire stuff, we don't really...
You guys can just...
Who gives a shit?
It's interesting, like, Last Harara, because this seems, like, hand-built, and, like...
Yeah, well, you know, have you ever heard of the Energia Buran?
Yeah, it's kind of, it is, like, quite Buran-like in that sense.
Yeah, like, we're gonna put our whole ass into this, and it's gonna get completely
disregarded on the dustbin of history.
Yeah, I guess, like, a guy who doesn't, like, uh, have any oversight because the Empire
is collapsing is also the guy who, like, designs quite a good car, because he wants to, but then,
you know, is just left to have it do nothing, right?
Um...
Yeah.
Like the person pushing out the last Evo at Mitsubishi.
Oh.
R.I.P.
Sad, isn't it?
Yeah!
It's incredibly depressing.
The auto industry is littered with cars like this.
Yeah.
I want this one, actually.
That'll be cool.
The Garz 3102.
They tried to do something different, something cool with it, and sort of succeeded.
But, uh, yeah.
Next slide, please.
The next slide is my special interest.
Go for it.
Go off, Wayne.
This is, okay, so again, this is kind of a, this one is, it is a communist car in the
sense that, like, it was, it started in a company that wasn't communist to begin with,
and then, you know, World War II happened, some things changed.
Uh, this is a Tatra.
Uh, it is the third oldest car company in existence.
Mm.
Um, and it is genuinely communist in the way that, uh, these, their cars that they built
absolutely fucking love to kill Nazis.
Uh, it's probably the thing they're most famous for.
The next headline just turned blood red.
Yeah, it was infamously good at killing Nazis.
Um, this is one of the first streamlined cars ever built.
So this is, this is a, uh, Tatra 77 right here.
It came out in 1934.
That's magnificent.
Um, so the Chrysler Airflow came out around the same time.
You know, it's, it was people were starting to think about the possibility of aerodynamics
because you could finally like shape sheet metal, sheet metal beyond just like, Oh, we
built you two boxes and tape them together.
Um, but nobody was really working with this car actually had like a 0.27 or something.
Uh, coefficient of drag.
Um, and next slide, please.
Oh, so just to, just to push drive this home really quick.
This is what a Mercedes Benz looked like in 1934.
This is a, this is.
Oh, nevermind.
I take it back.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sorry.
I was going to say something, but I figured I'd let you stew for a second.
Oh, the fact that in the notes there's a quote from Hitler saying he likes it.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
It's fucking over.
I can't believe Bubby you love Hitler.
I'm turning the Hitler particle detector on myself.
Oh my god.
I finally got this podcast cancelled.
I can't believe it.
It took like what, nine guest appearances?
Yeah, and then you tricked two thirds of us into becoming Hitler.
You tricked two people into becoming Hitler, yeah.
We got two Hitlers on this podcast now.
Only the poles are pure of heart.
Exactly.
Exactly.
Um.
So in any case, this is, this is what a Hitler car looked like in 1934, right?
I'm booing.
For comparison, you know, you have this streamlined, beautiful piece of art the Czechoslovakians
have built, um, which is the Tatra T77.
And then you have this, this, you know, it phallic, disgusting fascist car.
Of course.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Terrible.
Hey, guys.
Hey, guys.
What did the first Hitler say to the second Hitler?
What?
It's whatever you two are talking about right now.
God, fuck you.
I'll kill you.
Don't blink that and leave it in.
Oh, I have to fart real bad.
Directly, directly into microphone.
I can't.
My ass is not that maneuverable.
I don't know if you know this, but I'm a big fatty, fat fatty.
Me too, buddy.
All right.
You were saying, Victoria, before Roz rudely interrupted you?
Not us.
Well, yeah, you were having a Hitler conversation.
I do, as we know, hate the Jews.
That's what I saw on Twitter, actually.
Someone's going to clip that and get yelled at.
And they're going to get some weird shit about how I, yeah, the wrong kind of Jew or whatever.
Well, that's what Governor Josh Shapiro believes.
I could.
I listen.
I could fuck Josh Shapiro up in a fight.
Leave that in tail.
Oh, you were saying.
So in any case, like this is the Nazi strategy to cars was kind of similar to like the American strategy to building cars, which was just more displacement.
Throw it at the problem.
Eventually, the car will go faster.
So you have these enormous hoods.
These cars are not very like like this.
They aren't super refined yet.
So when the Nazis invade Czechoslovakia in 1937, they freaked the fuck out at the Tatra.
They were like, what is this thing?
This is insane.
Because even as early as 1934, the T77 is like, it's like a modern car, right?
Like it's like quiet on the freeway.
You can drive it like it's on a freeway.
It can do 55 miles an hour and it's fine, which is not something that cars in the 30s were very good at doing yet.
So the quote from Adolf Hitler to Ferdinand Porsche in 1937 says,
that, referring to the Tatra T77, is the car for my highways.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
So Hitler was just talking about the first car.
So you're Hitler.
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah.
No, wait.
No.
Yes.
No, you're Hitler.
Next slide, please.
All right.
We're going to finally figure out which of us is Hitler.
It's you.
It's Ross.
Oh, my God.
It was milkshake all along.
So.
Died 1945.
Born 2023.
Welcome back, Adolf Hitler.
It's just a picture of Milkshake.
So this is, this is the, this is the.
God damn it.
I think, I think Milkshake's actually from 2013 or so.
I don't, I don't know how old your Hitler cat is.
I'm sorry.
I actually don't know either.
I don't think, I don't think my friend LJ, who actually is the owner of Milkshake, knows either.
No.
No, no one knows.
No one knows.
Milkshake doesn't have it on her, really.
Yeah.
So this is the, this is the rear of the Tatra 87, which is a similar car that, you know, came
out around the same time.
Same design.
It's an iteration over the 77.
Beautiful.
This one had a 2.9 liter air-cooled V8 that made 85 horsepower.
Can I say this is beautiful without getting called Hitler?
Yeah, this is, this is beautiful.
Thank you.
This is the car I want.
Yeah.
Um, so it could do a hundred miles an hour.
So then you can be Hitler.
I'm not Hitler.
It's like, it's like the opposite of that game's secret Hitler.
It's like extremely, like, latent Hitler.
Not latent.
The opposite of it.
It's an Abbott and Costello bit, but instead of the-
Overt Hitler.
Yeah, no, it's actually, every player's named Hitler.
Secret Hitler, but everybody gets a Hitler card, is-
Yeah.
See how long that takes to fuck everything.
Dealing a bunch of Hitler cards into, like, fucking, uh, like,
Apples to Apples.
Apples to Hitler is not my favorite game.
Adels to Adels.
You do a murder mystery dinner party, but it turns out that actually everyone is Hitler.
Yeah, it was, it was Colonel Hitler in the fall.
Oh.
Let me guess, it was in the Fuhrer bunker with a revolver.
Yeah, sometimes less research is more, you know what I mean?
This is the one I actually did all the research on.
Well, sometimes more research is more, I guess.
And the rest of the podcast is gonna be fucked.
In a world where everyone is Hitler,
only one man can restore sanity.
Yeah, the Hitler fans.
Is it also Hitler?
No, no, it stars Joseph Stalin.
I was gonna say, it better be Stalin, man.
Slowly panning across the street, every man, woman, and child,
little postage stamp mustache.
Even the babies.
There's a baby in a stroller with a postage stamp mustache.
Oh, okay, get it together, get it together.
Delirium.
I'm fine.
I'm going good.
I remember calling this, like, midnight your time.
Yes, yeah, yeah.
This is, like, the third thing I've had to do today,
and that's, like, three too many things for me on any given day.
Can you believe this, folks?
November thinks Adolf Hitler is funny.
Oh, this is, thank God this is going on the big feed.
Tell me about this fucking comment.
Um, okay.
So, anyway, pictured here is a Tatra 87.
This is the one that's easier to find stats on
because it's, like, a more modern car.
It's a good thing it's 87 because it was a Tatra 88.
It would be even more Hitler, you know?
Yes.
I know.
This podcast has reached levels of Hitler,
previously unprecedented.
People tried to warn us any time
if we said anything about Ukraine.
I love myself.
I came out and talked about cars.
This is inevitable.
The dealership disease is setting in.
Yeah, I'm going to get a Black Sun tattoo
and die.
Jesus.
Do you have any lease deals for me
on a new Silverado?
I told you.
Yeah.
I just said I have a Black Sun tattoo,
so obviously I also run a car dealership.
Do you not pay attention
to any of your reading material?
You guys heard of the plot
of the Wolfenstein reboot from 2008?
That's basically me.
Oh, great guy.
Anyway, this car was really good.
About the T77,
Wilhelm Heinz from Motor Journal in 1934 said,
it is a sensation when it comes to its construction,
to its appearance,
and to its performance.
However, it isn't a sensation
that has just fallen from the skies,
but it is a logical extension
of the roads themselves,
which Hans Ledwinke made 13 years ago.
I remember I looked up
who Hans Ledwinke was
as further specifically,
and then I forgot.
I'm going to blame the medication.
That's fine.
Or the two-thirds of a beer.
I mean, two-thirds of a beer
hits different
when you're recording a podcast.
It also hits different
when you're on a lot of medication.
Also, yeah.
Also, when you're Hitler.
Go down, Ross!
I think Hitler's problem
was the medication
not hitting hard enough, you know?
That's a good point, yeah.
You know,
the car maintains 145 kilometers an hour,
it has astonishing handling,
it drives through curves
with speeds that are both
mad and safe,
and it seems to just float
on any kind of road.
It is a car which opens
new perspectives to car construction
and automotive practice.
This thing was incredibly groundbreaking.
So, the 77 and the 87
have this enormous,
not enormous,
but heavy V8
sitting over the rear axle,
which is a rear swing axle.
So, I don't know
if you're familiar with those,
but, like, it can,
if you're cornering really hard,
you can basically just,
like, pretzel the wheel
underneath the back of the car.
Ooh, fun.
Ooh, never had a car
break a leg
like a racehorse before.
And, of course,
it can do 100 miles an hour.
So, the Nazis
invade Czechoslovakia.
They're like,
wow, these cars are way better
than our shitty-ass
Mercedes-Benz's.
They steal them,
and then they
fucking die immediately.
Like,
next slide, please.
Jesus Christ.
Here's an auto-journalist
doing this two years ago.
Oh, wow.
This is a museum car
from the Lane Automotive Museum,
which is the largest collection.
Did they like it when you do that
to their museum car?
Yeah, yeah.
No, an auto-journalist
got into it and was like,
oh, we should do some, like,
performance benchmarking of it,
and then fucking immediately
rolled it.
So, in World War II,
actually, German officers
were eventually forbidden
from driving them
because they were dying
too often
because they loved
to roll these fucking things.
Are you suggesting
that the, like,
Nazi officer mind
contains a combination
of, like, hubris
and dangerous incompetence?
Yes.
Also, the auto-journalist mind,
speaking from
personal experience
and observed experience.
I like the
three-piece windscreen.
That's cool.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
This is all cool.
They're really genuinely beautiful.
The, like, front train
headlamp kind of look?
Fantastic.
The whole thing
is kind of train-esque.
Hmm.
Apart from the fact
where it's flipping.
Well, actually,
trains do that, too.
It's derailing.
Look up precision
scheduled railroading.
Um, anyway,
the other thing
I had in here
just because I wanted
to piss people off
was that, um,
the, so,
remember that quote
from Adolf Hitler
to Ferdinand Horsche
earlier in the episode?
Sure.
Uh, which Hitler?
Uh, the,
the original one.
Okay.
Cool, wrong.
Hitler.
Not the two new Hitlers.
The OG Hitler.
Um, so,
basically,
like, he took that to heart
and kind of just stole
his car design
for, um,
Porsche and Volkswagen.
And so, like,
the Beetle is just,
like, a shitty copy,
a shitty,
way inferior copy
of this
and, like,
the standard superior
that, uh,
Joseph Gans designed.
Uh, Joseph Gans
was a Jewish designer
who, uh,
designed a, um,
Eric's message
that are coming
from Hitler's car
and then was arrested
like a week after
meeting with Ferdinand Porsche
on completely bullshit charges.
Uh,
and then Porsche...
It was always insane
to remember
just how corrupt
the Nazis were
on top of everything else,
you know?
Yeah, so,
Gans ended up
fleeing Germany
and, you know,
like,
died in the 60s,
like,
lived his life
in obscurity,
but he, like,
came up with the original
design for the Beetle.
And, like,
Ferdinand Porsche's,
like,
the fetishism of his name,
uh,
just drives me insane.
The only reason
that the Beetle
didn't have the rollover
problem that Tatra did,
you know,
is because it was
so fucking slow
it couldn't actually
go fast enough to roll.
Uh,
you could push it down a hill
and it still wouldn't be
doing the same speed
as the Tatra
would have been
in the 30s.
So,
in any case,
I'm hoping that PR people
at Volkswagen
don't listen to bonus episodes.
Should be fine.
Because I will never
get a press car again,
but that's fine.
Yeah, fair enough.
This is one of the things
about German engineering.
Is it like,
oh my god,
the Germans,
they make such great machinery.
No,
the Bohemians
make the good machinery.
Bohemian machinery
is what you think
German machinery is.
Mm, yeah.
I'm gonna talk about
Skoda as well soon.
And, yeah.
Um,
so,
continuing with,
next slide please.
Continuing with the theme
of Tatras,
this is their post-war car.
God, I loved them.
Um,
this is,
so this is my favorite,
this is like one of my favorite
cars of all time.
I would literally,
like,
if I could sell a kidney
and buy one of these,
I probably would.
I don't think my kidney
is worth enough
to get one of these.
Oh.
Um,
but,
uh,
so after World War II ends,
you know,
the Soviets told Tatra
to go make trucks
because they made absolutely
absolutely incredible trucks.
Yeah.
Uh,
and so they were like,
yeah,
sure,
you know,
at this time,
you know,
Soviet,
like,
Russian cars
are still pretty bad,
right?
Like,
that Chaika
that,
you know,
Khrushchev was driving around
wouldn't really get developed
until,
like,
the mid,
late 50s.
People weren't really
getting their hands on them.
They're still driving around
in,
like,
Gaz M1s,
which are now,
like,
a 20-year-old design.
Um,
so officials wanted something
a little bit better.
So they come back to Tatra
in,
like,
five years later,
and they're like,
hey,
can you actually build us
a car worth a damn?
Because we know you can
actually build decent cars.
We've seen what you do.
Um,
of course,
Tatra engineers being themselves
had already been working
on a car in secret
when they were slacking off
on a bus design
because they just couldn't
help themselves.
So they were like,
oh,
sure,
we can probably whip
something up.
And of course,
they've got,
like,
three quarters of this
design done.
Uh,
so this is the Tatra 603.
It debuted in 1956
and it looks like this.
Um,
it has a 2.5 liter V8
that they had originally
developed for race cars.
Uh,
in the back of it,
it has a four on the tree manual
and you can actually see
out of it,
unlike other Tatras.
It's actually got,
like,
a full rear windscreen.
Um,
they built about 20 of these,
uh,
over the course of 20 years.
Um,
Fidel had one.
It was one of his
personal state cars
for a very long time.
Oh,
nice.
The Soviets basically
made this the,
the car that they would
export to every
other Eastern Bloc country.
Like,
if you were,
if you were genuinely
somebody in an Eastern
Bloc country,
you would get one of these
because it was the
nicest thing they had.
Um,
I mean,
Fidel,
that was a guy who knew
how to live,
right?
Oh,
yeah.
Fidel Castro
is a very stylish man.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Driving one of these,
two Rolexes on,
on the side of the wrist.
Uh,
yeah.
You got,
uh,
amounts of pussy
that would,
like,
kill a lesser man.
Absolutely.
Gigantic cigar.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Possibly from the CIA,
but it didn't explode
out of respect for him.
Um,
the thing that's,
like,
notable about these two
is,
again,
same with the 87
and 77.
These are,
like,
really refined cars.
You know,
they are,
they're air-cooled,
you know,
they're air-cooled V8s,
and so you'd think,
like,
oh,
God,
it's gonna be,
like,
you know,
driving a hot rod,
and they're not.
They're,
they're really genuinely,
like,
almost modern car-esque.
Americans were,
this is the one car
of the Soviet bloc
that really,
like,
America was about
a decade or two
behind on,
right?
Like,
we were not building
cars this good
for another 10 years.
Um,
so,
next slide,
please.
Ooh,
I like this.
They made it.
What Italian did they
get in to design this?
Uh,
that would be,
shoot,
it was,
I forget what Italian
it was.
It's like,
Gujarra,
or whatever the fuck,
right?
Like,
it looks like,
yeah.
This is a 613,
um,
it was,
uh,
Vignale.
Hmm.
Vignale.
Hmm.
It,
it looks,
it looks good as hell.
I got it.
The same company
that designed
the De Tommaso.
Hmm.
Interesting.
Didn't,
it was acquired
by De Tommaso.
That's,
that's the thing.
I guess it's not
the same company
that did the New York
City subway map,
is it?
No.
I,
I don't know.
It's very similar
sounding.
I,
they did the body work
for the Ferrari
375 America.
Yes,
they did.
Yeah,
they did a bunch of Ferraris
and launches and stuff.
Um,
I don't know.
This car doesn't do it
the same for me.
The,
the front,
if you look at it
from a different angle,
the like bonnet
is actually quite Bentley.
Um,
yeah.
Yeah.
Like sort of 80s Bentley.
Um,
yeah,
this had,
this had a 200 horsepower
air-cooled 3.5 liter V8.
Oh,
yeah.
It was a,
it was like not behind
the rear axle.
It was like above
and a little bit forward.
So it was,
it wouldn't just kill you
instantly.
You know what would make
this car a lesser grade
better?
Big headlamp in the middle
of the radiator.
Oh,
yeah.
Well,
there's no radiator.
It's air-cooled.
Big headlamp in the middle
of the front.
There we go.
Yeah.
Yeah,
that would help.
I mean,
I,
I think that it's probably,
it's more impressive.
It's,
it's for 75.
This is very stylistically
prescient.
Like,
I think that it's not
quite as prescient
as like the 603,
but it's still,
it's still like,
it looks like it could
be an 80s car,
right?
Nice thing about the
Soviet Union is
there's no traffic jams
for the engine
to overheat in.
Yeah.
But I,
I want the Castro bean.
Give me the 603.
Next slide,
please.
This one I just put in
specifically for Nova.
This is at the Lane Museum.
Oh,
this is beautiful.
From their personal collection
of Tatras.
They made it a racetrack
rapid response ambulance.
Every time
someone turns a sedan
into an ambulance,
I love it.
It's a magnificent.
I cannot get enough
of this kind of ambulance body.
It must be a pain
in the fucking dick
to work in.
Um,
like.
Oh yeah,
because the engine is beneath
where you're working
on the patient.
Just getting cardiac massage
from the like engine
underneath you,
you know?
Just rumbling V8
is a cure
for race car driver ailments.
That's what they built it.
Yeah,
exactly.
Um,
yeah,
this is,
I thought it was cool
because it looked funny.
But now,
you wind up transformed
into the new Stig
by the time
you're,
you're at the,
uh,
end of the trip.
So,
yeah,
I,
I really desperately,
like,
I love Tatras.
They,
they didn't make,
like,
you know,
they're,
they're,
they were,
existed before the Soviet Union.
They still make trucks today.
Um,
right.
Yeah,
again,
really good ones.
Yeah,
fantastic trucks.
Uh,
they just had this brief window
where they made,
like,
some of the most impressive cars
in the world
that were so different
than everything
everybody else was making.
I'm obsessed with them
and there's,
like,
hardly any in the US.
The,
the Lane Museum,
which has that 603
that I posted the pictures of,
um,
and the car that got flipped,
like,
they have,
I think they've got,
like,
15,
including this ambulance
and that is the most
Tatras.
Sorry.
Um.
That's fine.
My voice is going too.
That is the most Tatras
in any single collection
in the Western Hemisphere.
Wow.
There's just not that many of them.
Not quite.
So.
For the record,
like,
Tatra wasn't the only
Czech car manufacturer
that the Soviets did this to.
Praga,
um,
did,
like,
some interesting cars
and then
immediately after the,
the,
like,
sort of,
like,
the end of the war,
um,
the,
the new,
like,
Czechoslovak government
was like,
nope,
you do trucks now.
And they
really did,
like,
an incredible,
the Praga V3S,
um,
I didn't,
like,
put it in the,
in the slides,
but,
like,
I don't know,
maybe we can flash it up
in the edit.
Um,
looks like
something out of the,
like,
30s,
um,
but absolute,
like,
workhorse,
um,
and,
like,
stayed in production
for,
like,
50 years.
Beautiful.
Beautiful.
I want to do a separate episode
on Soviet trucks
and buses.
I will fully do this.
You don't know
the number of hours
I have sunk into,
into SnowRunner.
Speaking of,
because we're getting
very,
very much into the,
kind of,
off-road zone
for the next couple of slides.
Um,
you can get the next slide.
This thing,
oh,
my beloved,
this is,
this is a...
Oh, look,
it's so cute.
It's so happy to see it.
It's the Soviet Land Rover.
It's a Waz 469.
Um,
UAZ,
like,
Ulyanovsk Automobile Plant.
This is the,
like,
Soviet equivalent
of,
like,
a,
like a Jeep,
a Humvee,
a Land Rover Defender,
right?
It's your,
kind of,
like,
all-purpose military
four-by-four.
They made a civilian version,
um,
ultimately,
because,
like,
it's too good
and it's too useful
not to.
Um,
it's,
this is one of the kind of things
that you have to confront,
right,
is that you can build
a very civilized Soviet car
and then realize that
for much of the actual
territory of the Soviet Union,
the roads are still
absolutely horrendous
and impossible.
Yes.
Um,
and if you want to drive,
like,
anywhere particularly cold
or,
like,
uh,
particularly rural,
you need four-wheel drive
as an absolute minimum
and you need something
that's easy to fix
and so,
what you have here
is something that has,
like,
three parts,
all of which can be called
by interchangeable swear words
and fixed by hitting them.
Um,
I do not believe
to this day
there is a paved road
all the way across Russia.
Entirely possible.
They run these
in,
like,
deepest Siberia,
uh,
where you,
like,
just about
have to keep them warm
and that's all
you have to do to them.
Like,
you need,
like,
not even a heated garage,
you need, like,
a blanket over them.
Um,
it's genu-
the engine in these things
will accept,
like,
dirt,
essentially.
Like,
so long as it has
a single glimmer
of an octane
in there,
it will combust
and it will propel you,
right?
It won't necessarily
like it,
but it will do it
and it will go,
it will do the whole thing
up like a sort of
70 degree incline.
I love these things.
You mix,
you mix all those fuels
from the long drive
into each other
and then stick it in here,
it's fine.
Yeah,
pretty much.
It's,
it's a 75 horsepower
inline four
and it runs on,
on like gasoline
with an octane rating
as low as 72.
Wait,
wait,
wait,
wait,
they sold,
they still make this?
Yes,
absolutely.
Like,
currently.
Yes.
You could buy one
in Mexico
Yes.
that had a winch
and a lift kit on it.
Yes,
yes.
Like three years ago.
Okay,
I didn't realize
this was still currently
in,
I thought it was like
10 years ago
or something.
It's sort of like
if the UK wasn't soy,
right?
We hadn't given up
and made a new
Land Rover Defender
and we just decided,
hey,
we got it right
with this one.
Let's just keep
making them forever
and that's what they did.
It can run on gasoline
with an octane rating
as low as 72.
Yes.
It's like,
basically like an
outboard motor
in this thing.
I love it to pieces.
They made,
like,
millions of these.
Mostly for the military,
as you see here.
It's like a very
adaptable platform.
You can turn it
into fucking anything.
You can put a big
box on the back.
You can give it a trailer.
You can do whatever
the fuck you want.
Just in case,
if you want something
a bit bigger,
there's another option
with the same engine,
which we'll talk about later.
But, like,
if we go to the next slide,
we can see some
Russian off-roading.
And I just,
I really appreciate it
as a vibe.
Suspension is for the weak.
Not drink driving.
It's for the weak.
This is what driving
my ex's 4Runner felt like.
Evgeny,
hold my vodka.
Like, genuinely,
the old 4x4 suspension
is just like,
yeah,
it won't bottom out.
Don't worry about it.
Yeah,
it's fine.
Don't need power steering,
either.
Next slide, please.
So,
the slightly more
civilized version,
seen here in a real
dude's rock moment,
is the Lada Niva.
And this was,
it had the same thing
as the,
like,
the last Volga,
right,
where it was kind of
a victim of its own success,
in that it was too good
and therefore too valuable
for export.
And so,
even though you obviously
need a bunch of them
in Russia
and, like,
other bits of,
like,
the sort of,
like,
Eastern Bloc,
it doesn't matter,
you can't get one for 20 years
because we're selling them
all in the West,
right,
to generate the,
like,
currency reserves
that we need.
Ultimately,
yeah,
ultimately,
these trickle down
and, like,
they're still,
like,
to this day,
very,
very popular
in Russia.
Yeah,
actually,
I know
that one of the other,
like,
there's,
like,
three trans-human
automotive journalists
and one of them
actually has one of these.
Her name is Elle,
she writes for
driving.ca
and she's got,
it's very cool.
I want to drive it
so fucking badly.
This thing is,
like,
it's very much
like the Waz,
it's,
like,
it's got,
again,
four parts,
right,
fixes itself,
runs on,
like,
I don't know,
lawnmower petrol.
It's got those cute
little eyebrows, too.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
just kind of like,
okay,
I guess I'll see
where this goes.
And there's a bunch,
like,
the Soviets made
a shitload
of off-road vehicles,
for, like,
mostly military purposes,
but also stuff like
forestry.
One of the
weirder ones
is,
if we go to the next slide,
um,
hold on a second.
Yeah,
this is,
oh, no,
this is nice,
nice boxy guy.
A pinnacle
of, like,
the kind of,
like,
bodyworking art,
the coach building arts,
right?
Um,
this is...
It's like a sad
VW thing,
I love it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
this is a Luaz,
um,
from the Lutsk
automotive plant.
Um,
they made a bunch of,
like,
jeeps and quasi-jeeps,
uh,
like,
mostly for paratroopers,
the idea was you could
kick this out the back
of a cargo plane,
and you could, like,
drive it around
while you're waiting
to get killed.
Um,
and, uh,
occupying a similar role
was the well bike
in a bridge too far.
Um,
I was imagining
you were driving around
in the air
while you're waiting
to get killed
because you forgot
the parachute.
I mean,
you could do
parachute drops
with, um,
I know it's like,
BMDs and stuff
with the, like,
crew in the vehicle.
So,
That sounds alarming.
Yeah,
yeah,
I kind of want to try it,
but I also believe
that I would get,
like,
the hardest concussion
a person has ever had,
banging my head off,
like,
an unprotected surface.
Yeah,
I would avoid
jumping out of
a perfectly good airplane.
At all times.
But, like,
as you can see,
it's, like,
very mechanically simple,
but, like,
that's what you want.
It's something where,
like,
the kind of,
like,
design and the intended
function marry together
quite well,
right?
Because if you make it simple,
it's, like,
simple to repair,
there's less to go wrong,
um,
and ultimately
you don't need a lot of stuff,
you don't need heated seats,
you just need somebody's armchair,
like,
bolted into the thing.
Um,
but,
if you do want
all of those capacities,
but you want some more
space and versatility,
if you go to the next slide,
my beloved,
the WAS452,
the bohanka,
the loaf.
Oh, I like it.
I like it.
This is,
this is...
Performs as advertised.
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah,
all the aerodynamics
of a toaster.
This is a very popular
ambulance,
um,
as well as,
like,
police,
construction,
any number of things
where you need,
like,
a van body,
and you need it to be able
to go anywhere.
This was, like,
the state of the art.
It's the same engine
out of the 469.
Um,
it's, like,
basically the same chassis,
you just put, like,
a different body on it
and call it good.
I love this thing
to pieces,
right?
Uh,
It looks like my old van
a little bit.
Yeah,
it's beautiful,
right?
Uh,
it's,
it's,
like,
so ugly
that it,
like,
circles back around again.
I'm,
I'm a huge fan of it.
And again,
like,
because they're still useful,
because none of the stuff
ever dies,
and because,
like,
even still,
in,
like,
hyper-capitalism,
because of,
like,
you know,
securitization
and,
like,
being part of,
like,
a,
sort of,
like,
outwith the security
block of the West,
all this stuff's still
current in Russia.
You can still see these
driving around.
Um,
oh,
yeah,
I mean,
you can probably fix it
with the hammer.
Yeah,
absolutely.
Well,
and they probably made,
like,
10 trillion parts for them,
too,
so that's,
like,
this is true.
That's,
like,
the big thing with,
like,
old American cars,
is,
like,
if you live in America
and you're,
like,
looking at,
like,
a,
you know,
60s Ford Falcon or whatever,
is it a compelling car?
No,
but can you rebuild it
in AutoZone parking lot?
Yes.
And that's,
like,
that's kind of what makes
them so compelling
and why they've,
like,
why boomers love
wrenching on old American stuff
is because they can,
you know,
beat seven Miller High Life steep
and still probably get the timing
mostly right
and they can also have
a birds catalog from Summit
and get,
you know,
billet chrome spark plugs
next day delivered.
I'm just thinking about
the ground clearance
of this thing as well.
I'm,
I'm,
like,
I kind of want to drive this.
Yeah,
me too.
I was thinking of what
Russian AutoZone is.
Is this a cop van pictured?
This one here is,
yes.
Um,
but like...
Russian AutoZone, Roz.
Oh,
yeah,
it says Polizia on the side.
It does,
which makes this a recent-ish picture
because they only changed
from Polizia,
uh,
from Milizia to Polizia
in,
uh,
oh god,
2008?
Don't quote me on that.
Anyway,
um,
next slide,
please.
Because now we've got to
shift countries,
right?
We've got to go
to Poland.
The People's Republic of Poland.
Oh god,
its face is falling off!
This,
this,
this is called a
smik,
uh,
and it was the smallest,
like,
micro car they could design.
Uh,
you could only get into it
through the front.
Um,
and they made it,
it was terrible,
and they never released it
as a consequence.
Um,
like BMW,
which decided to release
the Assetta anyway.
Yeah,
no,
they didn't have the kind of resources
to be wasting on this kind of shit,
they just, like,
built one,
and were like,
this is a terrible fucking idea.
Absolutely not.
Love Poland.
Um,
next slide,
please.
So,
this is the big,
like,
um,
the big, like,
sort of,
post-world Polish car,
aside from the Warschawa,
which was, like,
the,
the Pomero we saw earlier.
Um,
this is an FSO Sirena,
uh,
like a siren.
Um,
and,
again,
it's like,
it's functional,
a bit like a Morris Minor.
Um,
made...
It's got a big grin.
It does.
Big,
scary grin.
Um,
they made,
they made,
like,
a million of these.
Um,
there's still kind of,
like,
a wave of nostalgia for them.
Um,
and,
again,
much the same kind of dynamic
as the Poveda,
in that you still have to wait,
like,
five years,
but you get Ankar out of it.
However,
what's interesting about the Sirena,
to me,
is not the thing itself,
but,
if we go to the next slide,
much like Tartre,
being forced to work on buses,
and secretly designing the coolest car
they could imagine in their spare time,
the designers of this,
did a sport version.
Nice.
Yes.
It's very,
it's very Kaiser Darren of them.
Yeah,
right?
Like,
it's very,
like,
this is,
this is our first stab at a sports car,
and we know we should put,
like,
swoopy lines on it,
because it makes it faster.
I'm assuming that this car has basically got,
like,
the world's most dog shit motor.
It makes,
it makes like 55 horsepower.
Yeah.
Wow.
But it probably has no suspension improvements over the sedan either.
Yep,
it's just a fiberglass body.
It makes,
like,
It's a Kaiser,
Darren.
Oh my god,
it's an original Corvette.
To be fair,
like,
because it weighs nothing,
it does,
by,
by my understanding,
it's fast,
right?
Um,
and people looked at this,
and they loved it immediately.
And it was in this weird situation in,
in Polish history,
right,
where the Polish media,
and in particular,
the,
like,
automotive,
like,
trade press,
such as it was,
still had enough independence,
that they were like,
hey,
what the fuck is this?
We love it.
When is it coming to,
like,
when can I not get one?
When can I wait five years to get one of these?
Um,
and,
this kind of put the authorities in this weird position,
because they're like,
I don't want to make things that are fun.
I want to make 10 million of the previous slide.
Um,
so that,
like,
We built this yesterday,
yes.
Yeah,
exactly.
It's like a reverse cyber truck,
you know?
Hmm.
We made it too good.
Yeah.
Oh,
the old bud problem,
man.
People,
people like it,
and we made it too good,
and now they want to buy it from us,
and we don't want to sell it to them.
Um,
and so,
what ultimately happened was they built two prototypes,
and they kept being photographed,
and people kept going,
when can we,
when can we buy them,
when can we see them?
Uh,
there was even,
like,
foreign interest,
and instead of perhaps,
like,
spinning this out into a cool little,
like,
MG money spinner for them,
what they did was,
uh,
call them and tell them to put the prototype in a garage,
and never tell anyone about it ever again.
Um,
and that's what they did.
Like,
the Serena Sport,
they made it a little,
like,
pickup truck too,
um,
just,
like,
were killed by the Polish government,
which,
of all the dissidents that it,
like,
took out to the woodshed,
it's not high up the list for sympathy,
but, like,
still,
though.
I mean,
for me it is.
I care more about cars than people.
That's gotta be my job description.
Yeah,
fair enough.
I think it's,
I think it's a sad story,
you know?
Like,
it would have been terrible,
probably,
if they put it into mass production,
but,
like,
it's a case of,
like,
central planning,
you gotta decide that,
I do look like that it looks like a frog.
Yeah.
Like,
Mr. Toad is happy to see you,
and also a little scared.
The groper sport.
Mr.
Mr.
Toad's DB5,
yeah.
I mean,
it is one of those things too,
where it's like,
I don't know,
I mean,
if your only car is a sports car,
then you're still getting the same,
and it's not,
like,
any different,
like,
a Mazda Miata does not take more resources to build than a Mazda CX-50.
It actually takes fewer.
It quite literally does.
It quite literally does.
It's asocial, though.
It could lead to hooning.
Yeah,
exactly.
I also want to point out,
the Miata,
the Miata is built with the joy of children,
Victoria.
So,
I don't know where you can find that on an assembly line,
but when you do,
come back to me.
The Republicans are going to fix that with Project 225.
Oh, dear.
I said,
I said that just to be,
like,
annoying,
and I watched Victoria's face seize up,
and, like,
visibly be like,
what the fuck is he talking about?
No,
I was trying to think of a bit to come back with,
and it was such a fucking curveball,
I didn't know what to say.
A wild card.
Oh, yeah.
Speaking of which,
viewers,
we're still trying to buy me a Viper
that I did send to Victoria.
It's in the chat.
So,
get on that,
viewers.
Absolutely.
Liam wants to crash into a building.
Yeah,
multiple times.
But see,
that's the thing.
It's like,
Bloomberg's here,
baby,
let's go.
It wouldn't take any more resources for you to crash a Dodge Viper
than it would for you to crash,
you know,
a minivan.
My wife's RAV4.
Give me the next slide.
Yeah,
but the only way you can crash into the second floor of a building
is with the Viper.
That's why God invented the Durango SRT, man.
No,
what's so fucking bad?
I gotta talk to us about a less exciting car.
I will have you know,
this was European Car of the Year,
1967.
Those people who did that should be executed.
This is a Fiat 125.
Wow,
look at those bike tires.
It's,
it's,
this was like European Car.
It was capital E,
European,
capital C Car,
in the 60s.
Eurofighter Typhoon,
yeah.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
and so what happened was,
both,
like,
the Polish automotive industry
and the Russian Soviet automotive industry
licensed the 125 from Fiat.
In the Soviet Union,
that's what a Lada is.
The company Vaz,
Volga automotive plant,
not to do with the Gaz Volga,
again,
you see why this is confusing,
adapted this very lightly
into the,
into the Lada,
and then there was a series of these
which basically didn't change much,
right?
This was the big problem with Ladas,
right?
Is that they're,
like,
very reliable,
they're very cheap,
and they were exported on that basis,
but,
like,
this,
it was fundamentally underneath this Fiat
from the 1960s
that they kept making for,
like,
40 years.
And so,
by the end of it,
they might put some new body work on it,
or,
like,
a new dashboard,
or whatever,
but it was still,
like,
a,
you know,
aged design.
And Poland did the same.
They did a,
a Polsky Fiat,
which is,
which is what this is.
And the difference is,
they put an extra set of headlamps on it.
The original Fiat only has a single pair.
And,
yeah,
it's,
it's Ankar.
It works fine.
Like,
both this and the Ladas were exported pretty widely,
and,
although people made a lot of jokes about them,
and,
there's this real thing,
part of what I wanted to get into in doing this episode,
is that,
like,
the kind of top gearification of this stuff,
where it's like,
not,
I'm not just saying that these things have problems,
they have to be the worst car in the world,
because of,
like,
communism,
or whatever.
That was pretty good.
Thank you.
That was really good,
oh my god.
So,
so,
like,
they have to be,
like,
hyperbolically bad,
and they have to be hyperbolically bad,
because they were made by communists.
Um,
and it's like,
well,
no,
it's,
part of the reason why these things suck,
is because they're an adaptation of an adaptation of an adaptation of a design made by,
like,
Italians,
who,
granted,
they were working in Turin in the 60s,
so they probably work on communists,
but it's not the point.
The point is,
like,
making these a laughingstock is kind of,
like,
betrays some,
like,
historical interest here,
right?
Um,
Also,
the capitalist cars,
I don't think were that much better.
Often,
no,
I mean,
like,
that's not.
You did the Pinto.
Like,
also,
yeah,
I'm coming for you,
Doug DeMuro,
and your,
your terrible review of the Trabant.
Yeah.
I remember what you did,
Doug DeMuro.
I,
I,
I mean,
I've got a whole thing in the Yugo,
about the Yugo in here,
and it's like a similar kind of story,
where it's like,
yeah,
these,
these just got shit on for no good reason.
Hmm.
For being shit on them all.
It's like the,
the things about Paris Hilton is that she was famous for being famous.
Hmm.
These cars suck because they suck.
Well,
and also just like,
these are cars that are designed to be owned by people that are poor.
Right.
And there's nothing more shameful in a capitalist society than to be poor.
Also,
it's also kind of stuff that you don't need to,
like the,
the stuff that made the,
the lot of successful in Russia,
right.
Uh,
was like,
they strengthened it.
They ruggedized it.
They made a lot,
that they made a lot of it out of like heavier steel.
Um,
and like,
it's like winterized and in like Britain in the,
in like seven,
you didn't need that.
Right.
Well,
and the other thing too,
that like,
I think it's worth noting with,
you know,
Clarkson and top gear and kind of like contemporary automotive journalism.
And this is not a problem that is easy to solve,
but like the longest term tests that most places do are like a year.
Right.
Right.
It's like,
how was this car reliable for me for a year?
And usually they still can't even get through that without issues.
I remember,
um,
I think it was car and driver had an Alfa Romeo Giulia,
which most beautiful sedan of the past 50 years.
But the thing was in the shop for like six of the 12 months they had the car.
Um,
so,
you know,
even then,
yeah,
I think it was an unreliable piece of shit.
But like,
you know,
the thing with lot is like,
yeah,
there's still,
there's,
there's sixties models that are still running around because they're
indestructible.
It's the same reason that people love like OG Jeeps,
right?
Like if you know how to surface,
uh,
like four liter AMC straight six,
you can basically keep it running until the heat death of the universe.
It will continually get uglier and the interior will have more trim bits break.
But if you need it to run,
it will,
um,
which is why I'm like a Toyota devotee,
right?
Like they don't make the best cars,
but they make cars that run for like shit forever.
Yeah.
That's what I need.
Speaking of my dad's 2000 cheap Cherokee.
Speaking of,
if we go to the next slide,
engine block with hammer with cousin Yuvgeni.
Literally that engine block caught off fire and it was fine.
Like,
my dad was like,
my car caught off fire.
Saluting his fucking heart right now.
I'm showing you here a Polish cultural icon,
right?
Which is made in Italy.
Um,
this is a,
it's a Fiat 126,
right?
But which was like,
moderately successful as one of these like,
uh,
small,
very small like Fiat cars.
Um,
that didn't-
Oh,
this looks like it would be great fun to drive it 50 miles an hour.
Just slide forever.
You get the vibe.
You get the vibe.
So the thing is,
right,
you buy this in Europe,
it's because you're like,
you're a kid and you want to like,
cram your girlfriend and some luggage into it
and go and like,
drive around the south of Italy for a while.
Right?
Um,
if you drive this in Poland,
it's because it has been license built in Poland.
You have waited 15 years for it.
You are fitting three children,
your wife,
a caravan,
onto the back
and you are driving to the fucking seaside.
We're resilient people.
Absolutely.
Uh,
this is,
it's called a Maluch,
uh,
like a,
like a toddler in,
in Polish.
And it's absolutely iconic.
People have the same kind of,
if not more,
fondness for it that like,
East Germans have for the Trabant,
right?
Which we'll get to.
Um,
it's like,
kind of retrospectively kind of cool now.
Um,
it's,
it's really like,
lightweight,
uh,
like fun car that ended up being forced to do everything.
And people have this weird affection for it.
It's just like tiny little,
like coughing engine.
Um,
I feel like there's no like American equivalent of this.
Like are Americans nostalgic for any kind of small car?
Oh,
I mean,
uh,
there's like a weird cult around like malaise motors,
but I feel like.
Yeah,
that's,
that's weird.
And those were all huge.
Anyway,
I feel like you're starting to see a little bit with like,
like CRXs and stuff,
right?
Yeah.
People really miss those.
Like they miss old eighties Hondas.
I'm not saying this because I miss old eighties Hondas or anything like that.
Um,
there's no like cult of the Nash Rambler,
you know,
but there should be,
there should be.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I think like,
I think the other thing too is just like America has never like fundamentally
looked at something that was good enough to get the job done and then
appreciated it for what it did for them.
Hmm.
Do you know what I mean?
Like everything is the things that America appreciates are aspirational and
overbuilt.
Um,
so like,
you know,
the Chevelle is our legendary car of the seventies because no one could
afford one.
They made like 12 with the actual,
you know,
super sport package and the four before and all that.
But it's like,
it's what every kid lusted after.
It's like hard not to feel a little pang.
If you have any kind of sense of like egalitarianism in you at all,
that like this thing is the object of like communist desire,
right?
This is the aspirational thing.
And what you aspire to do with it is to fit like 11 of your friends into
it and drive to a party.
Yes.
Uh,
it's,
it's sweet.
I think that's why I liked my Camry so much.
Hmm.
The $600 piece of shit that like did what I asked of it.
And that was it.
Like it,
I fixed it with,
you know,
a 94 piece craftsman tool set and a gravel driveway and then drove it 600 miles.
Hmm.
And it basically didn't complain.
And like,
that to me is the highest aspiration of any car.
It's like,
Oh,
I did what you asked me to.
Cool.
You know they turn some of these into snow plows?
That kicks ass.
You can fully take the wheels off and put tracks on them if you want to.
Like,
Oh my god.
Ingenuity never ends.
Um,
next slide please,
though,
because things do have to get worse,
right?
We gotta talk about the decline of communism.
Um,
so this is,
this is an episode of Polonaise.
Um,
it's regularly described,
uh,
because it was exported to Britain,
which is always a mistake.
Don't bring your cars here because we will let loose British people on them.
And then we will say for the next like 40 years or whatever,
that the,
uh,
the worst cars in the world.
Yes,
this was literally on the worst car.
British Leyland?
Yeah,
exactly.
British Leyland,
punching a production assistant for not getting a hot meal,
et cetera,
et cetera.
Um,
so this thing was also originally a Fiat.
And then,
uh,
when they saw what the Poles had done to it,
the Fiat told them like,
by the sainted name of Gianni Agnelli,
you cannot call this a Fiat Polescape.
Uh,
you,
you have to go back to calling it an FSM,
like,
uh,
an FSO like,
uh,
like the Sirena.
Um,
and okay,
it's not good,
right?
I,
I,
I,
I,
I,
I,
I,
I,
I,
I,
I,
I,
I,
I,
I,
I,
I,
I,
I,
I,
I,
I,
but,
like,
any of the Polescape Fiat's hate this fuckin' thing.
Mostly because.
Good side then.
Yeah,
but things were kinda coming apart at this stage.
Oh.
Literally, with the car as well.
Um,
like, the quality control was not good.
Demonic.
The workers,
the workers were becoming revisionists.
Exactly, yeah.
You never wanna see it.
Like,
absolutely demonic work on the electrics on this,
apparently.
um and uh it just was it was a terrible car and ultimately this was the kind of like last hurrah
of of like polish communist car building which is a real shame um next slide please i i also got to
talk about this van uh this is this is a zhuk van um the only thing i have to say about it is that
i love how fun it looks uh yeah that's that's my only comment thank you i i went and looked this
up because i had never heard of it and it had so this came out in 1958 it had independent front
suspension in a cargo van from 1958 which is insane the ford bronco didn't get that until like 2020
when they brought it back for the seventh time the only the only other thing that i know about these
is that even still in poland you can find these converted into very very small fire engines and
the idea of one of these rolling up to your fire is so incredible that i i just it really like
holds yeah that is that is a friend-shaped vehicle yes yeah asymmetric like like part where they don't
have the slits cut in the grill oh yeah put the badge in it's just like it's really cute it's like
socialism with a human face uh next slide please all right i'm just i'm just sitting back guys coming
out of the no i mean the thing is like i so it's the biggest thing with the trabant right it's like
i know all of the history of it i should also say that when i was three years old i got a mystow of a
olive green trabant and unbeknownst to me i was like i love this thing it's fun and i played with it for
my whole childhood and i loved it um and my parents accidentally raised a communist despite their best
efforts as a result um so i was just born this way uh but like i know that they're supposedly suck i know
their bodies are you know decompose i know that they have like these smoky terrible motors that
you know are unreliable the thing is i've never driven one yeah and i drove a yugo and i came away
with a radically different opinion of that car than every other automotive journalist had so it's like
yeah i can tell you all of the stories about how they sucked um i know that people are like a
combination of either disdainful or like i like you'd mentioned like some east germans are nostalgic for
it and like i think the thing that automotive journalists consistently do especially western
ones talking about any other country's cars is they flatten the context in which they were developed
um not to get too calm about it but like you have to remember like a market uh the the material
conditions under which the car was conceived the competition it had the lack of competition it had
like what people were doing with it like all of these things matter because you wouldn't go up to
like like i love like the 90s jeep grand cherokee right uh first unibody suv um by modern standards
they drive like tractors right they are not refined but in the era if you compare it to like other things
that were four by fours absolutely just like groundbreakingly good and so that's the thing
right is like if you want to americans are good at doing this for american cars and like some european
cars and maybe they're finally starting to get okay about it with japanese cars but they like
even if you see modern reporting on like chinese evs right now they are losing their shit over
everything it's like oh well you know we with that this is because it's cars communist and so like
it's got to be bad or if the car is good it's because it's communist and so they cheated and there's
no there's no consistency because they're blinded by ideology um and i'm not obviously because i am
like completely impartial and always correct yeah here on this channel we support the revisionist
view of the trabant led by comrade aging wheels um i mean there's a bunch of people like uh both
writers and like uh like any number of content creators who are like sort of reappraising these
things right and i think that's one of the other kind of genres you can fit into it is like is this
thing like actually cool and nostalgic and the answer is well yeah kind of i guess but to the people
who actually got them it was like i think like you said the context isn't so much like is this
cool and nostalgic it's this is a motorcycle but i don't get rained on right like yeah it's it's a
motorcycle i can fit my kids in the back of um it looks like it'd be fun to just drive around a
little tiny city and go beep beep you know yeah absolutely uh you know drive this thing to the
baltic seashore um watch the gunboats go past it you're gonna go drive it to the big store the big
department store in the middle of the communist city and i'm gonna spend i'm gonna spend 45 rubles
the thing i don't know what that gets me is that is that like i think it is pretty symbolic of like
uh how the soviets like strip mined east germany for every resource possible and left them with only
the worst things for themselves oh i'll have some thoughts about that on the very next slide in fact
yeah yeah because i mean it was it was not a great car like just from a just from a resources
spent perspective it was like the minimum viable car and i mean that in like the literal sense
especially especially given that the ddr was in many ways the like most consumer communist country
in the eastern bloc right is the one where you could have like transgender also true um yes the one
which you could get like a washing machine and stuff right like uh the one which you could get these
like sort of high-end consumer goods you could get like a nice camera lens or whatever um to to have
the car be like this but this is not the only car manufactured in uh the the german democratic
republic this is a vatburg um also known affectionately to its owners as farty hans um which gives you
right away gives you a sense of the engine um so these germans knew better than to try and use
trabantz as like fleet vehicles so if you wanted like a taxi or a cop car in east germany it was it
was farty hans um and then farty hans kind of trickled down to their logo is the uh the nato auto
works yeah it's kind of what it is actually is uh like op for bmw because eisenacher motorenwerk right
was um emw was the bit of like bmw in what became east germany that then got nationalized
immediately by the communists and so they just changed it to this cool red bmw logo um and then
yeah and then it got changed again to like a veb uh i forget exactly what it was called um but like
they made these these farty hans these vatburg um cars uh which were like the more aspirational one and
it was kind of like the the end of the thing and ultimately these got killed by german reunification
um one of the things that happened after reunification was the uh uh vatburg tried to
make another one with like an actual decent engine from vw um and they had to like reconfigure the
whole engine bay to fit a vw engine into this um and then it turned out nobody wants this they want
to go and buy a vw or you know if they if they were in the party they want to go and buy a mercedes
um and so you kind of you lose out on a lot of this stuff by the way i do also want to say when
we're talking about east germany i didn't put this in either but you know what they were really
good at manufacturing was trucks again it's like this was it was it was the truck side of the the
the the world right like yeah you you need trucks you don't need cars you need trucks the truck
people you play a game of workers and resources soviet republic how many how many how many how many
cars are you buying not that many you need trucks you need trucks and the the truck that you
need specifically is one of my favorite trucks the uh the ether ifa w50 um and
so farming simulator 2024 when it comes out will not be playable until someone has modded in
this truck specifically this is a point of principle for me it applied to the last two farming simulator
games if i don't have an agricultural spray that i can hook to the back of that chassis
specifically this is bullshit i'm not interested um ifa made really good tractors too um yeah so
that that's that's east germany uh if we go to the the next slide talk about romania because
romania was in this like weird position much like yugoslavia as we'll talk about um where
you know all these countries were to an extent able to do things independently like romania more so
um and so instead of making a deal with fiat sort of running up that hill to make a deal with gianni
anelli um they made a deal with with reno um and so yeah this is a reno 12 um but it's been
license built in romania as a dacia a dacia 1300 um they did a kgb version for the uh the securitate
the 13th yeah literally yeah that's literally the only thing i know about this car company it's insane
to me that like no i saw one in the world yeah and i saw one of when i was in europe a while ago i was so
i was so excited i was so excited i was like i'm just like not not to pronounce dacia it's like right
but like yeah so they they made like a slightly nicer version for the like in order to pursue
alexander solzhenitsyn um and the thing that's high speed jades yeah oh my god oh my god he's he's
he's going to the gulag archipelago and they had a bunch of like iterations on this all with like the
the 1310 1320 etc etc etc um but the problem with this right is that they had made this deal with
reno for the reno 12 um and then they stuck with it for next slide please i'm just before we go to
the next slide i just want to comment on the train cars back here these would have been relatively new
at the time they already look like shit yeah i don't even know if this is in romania this might be
it could be it like italy or something as an ignorant american i couldn't tell you hey this
is like the sort of european standard rail car this does not look like a eastern european one or it
does look like an eastern european one but at that i i don't know i need to look it up uh this
freak car here looks german um i love this fucking this oh my god they made a shay they made a
youth um so dacia made made something called the pickup these things like the hyphenated name yeah
pickup the dacia pickup they kept making these for like 20 years after the end of communism uh romanians
fucking love these things i have seen these be converted into school buses you just put a truck
body on the back and an extra axle right um and the funniest thing about this and the thing that
i think is most revealing about the romanian car industry until it was like properly modernized
is that this is still a reno 12. this is the same car it's the same chassis it's the same car as the
previous slide they just kept it because that was the car that they had that was the car that they
made there was no provision for innovating on it it's fine it works we put a truck bed in the back
well and again you you've got this like you've got this momentum from having all the parts already
because like i don't know if you've seen this or not but uh nissan built the centra like the 1990
nissan centra in mexico and sold it new until like last year it's same car in production for like
23 years like no no updates whatsoever you could just buy a brand new 1990 nissan centra off of a
dealership lot and a lot of it was just because like oh i've owned three of these already and i
have a bunch of parts and you know i wore the last one out from ed being a taxi and hitting 500 000 miles
so i'll get a second one and then just do that i mean it makes sense in a way if you're thinking
about things from like a longevity perspective like the crown vic didn't really get any meaningful changes for
for 40 something years yeah like facelifts occasionally which is what this is but it's still
like there's still remnants of like the the like ltd in there like it's not it was not a major change
like it's only really recently with like unibody construction and really short like manufacturing time
frames where i feel like american cars you can get to the point where they are basically like they're
updating very frequently this isn't a terror my point is i'm defending this car yeah i get it uh
uh next what what is what is the lump here s it's it makes the car go faster well yeah it's a very
advanced type of speed hole yeah in need for speed underground too the air asymmetric air scoop gave
you extra style points hold on i'm looking this shit up what what is the lump on the hood of this
dacha pick up pick up i i have no it's a fuck it's on all of them what what is this uh maybe they had
like a weird air cleaner set up um for like emissions question mark i genuinely don't if you know what
that's to romania but like did they have emissions if you know what this is 40 year old cars there was a
lot of things wrong in ciauchescu's romaine if you know what the fuck this is please please get it
i think the funniest possible answer is they did an engine swap and then they didn't they realized
that they wouldn't fit so they just redesigned the bonnet to just have a lump that's what i suspect
yeah just has the fucking mismatched lump oh it's beautiful the dealer says well look and if it were
need for speed underground too that would give you a bunch of style points i love that i love that i love
i love the ball bar i love the fact that it has door trim on the rear door but not the front
it's it's perfect i i official car of the podcast the dacha pick up next slide please um we also
got to talk about some some good stuff not that the pickup isn't good um romania also once again
sensing a common theme for often military reasons a lot of these countries are very good at producing
domestically off-road vehicles um so romania has this company aro um and they produce like
it's sort of like a romanian land rover defender again um yeah this looks kind of like a defender
like half acidly like force femmed yeah and it it sort of like works like they exported these like all
over like india spain wherever and you still see them driving around like they got mountains it's cool
uh again very little maintenance required look ugly as sin um and i i really appreciate that about
them i was i thought it was kind of cute compared to a regular defender i also like a defender i've
driven a land rover defender and like they are massively overblown for how much people fetishize them
i'm sorry you mean i mean like the new ones are nice i have a review coming out about one like this
but like the the like 90s ones are like it's like reciprocating ball steering
they don't even return to center i know but like i don't care right exactly i'm a masochist there's no
room in them they're like i barely fit the seating position is incredibly uncomfortable like i know
somebody who road tripped across like africa in one and like i can't imagine that he must have aged 30
years in like the year he did if you're not a masochist you get a land cruiser or a hilux or
whatever but like if you are but i i mean i am and i would still get a land cruiser that's what i'm
saying here it's like it at some point you have to say for it and the defender is way above my tolerances
i like i like in this image uh that we stole from somewhere how subtle the watermark is i didn't even
notice that yeah cuban classics dot blogspot well shout out to cubanclassics dot blogspot dot com
that's that's a good that's a good i mean hell yeah um next slide please so cold war assault listen
indelibly imprinted in my psyche as the eastern european car because of these games um this is
this is like a video game take on a skoda i want to say 110 uh maybe 120. what is arma uh it's it's
like the series of like uh pseudo realistic military games that like grew out of what used to be called
operation flashpoint you saw a copyright issue it's it's it's like it's like what the super military
nerds play yeah i it's it's what i lost like large segments of my sort of like childhood and adolescence
too because it turns out that it came with a mission editor uh and i like used this functionally
as a kind of like video game military toy box i taught myself like basic like coding in order to
fuck with this yeah i need i need to simulate the folder gap but i'm the sober you don't know how right
you are um this is so i think we all know how right he is we've met you the thing is i'm i'm i'm actually
not hitler i'm like a sort of soviet uh battalion commander in like 1981 um east germany um but
yeah so i mean this was this was in the game because the developers were czech as like the car
the civilian car um there's a skoda rapid in there as well as like the sports car um skoda again like
another czech uh or czech or slovak at this point but czech um car company that again was like the most
successful or amongst the most successful at exporting stuff to the west um skodas had a bit
of a reputation for being like cheap and shit but like my grandparents had a skoda hatchback
um which they like absolutely loved um and like i remember fondly even so like um they were like
well-built cars for what they were and they're also cheap um if we go to the next slide we can see a
skoda estelle um which like looks kind of like a ford if you squint like and was weirdly innovative
for the context in which it came you know and all that came before it i just fell out of a coconut tree
yeah skoda skoda did very well out of like dacha uh sort of like close behind them now but but skoda
absolutely leapt on this idea of like modernization and like westernization and i never understood like
what the difference between those two car companies was when i was growing up uh dacha's romanian and
skoda's czech um that's the difference as i said when i was a kid i did not understand what the
difference was between those two things i would say skoda also made some good trucks yeah yeah absolutely
um and skoda like uh now is like sort of like mid-market right like they've kind of like below vw but
like above dacha right yeah absolutely and they've really like worked pretty hard to position
themselves in their market and like kind of uh like shed the taint of of communism right they
are part of volkswagen auto group though correct i hate why i shed the taint yeah i believe so
but this is this is the thing like it's interesting to me that they had to spend so much time getting
out from under the kind of clarksonism of it all of being like this is made by guys in fur hats
or whatever um and and sort of explain yeah and explain that the new czech republic was like a country
that had twinks in it for instance and just for the misery just for the record i do find it
hilarious that british people act superior about their auto industry at all ever i've driven a
bunch of british cars and like i've driven i drove a triumph tr6 right a incredibly charming vehicle uh
absolute piece of shit like oh yeah i cannot believe that they were making those like into the 80s
it's it's not acceptable well that you see that was also because of leftism right like um
that was a thatcher car this is like the most right with social democracy
because of the unions because of the unions you say oh my god i mean like i've driven going
i've driven so much stuff and it's just it's it's really like a lot of it is garbage and like
don't get me started on like you want to talk about bad electrical systems luke lucas prince of
darkness uh yeah 80s 80s bentley's if you want some good electrical issues that you've never seen
before yeah i mean my most controversial opinion is that actually the french probably built the best
cars um which nicest to be in certainly everyone everyone loves a citron a citron like i i would kill
for like a peugeot 405 they're like god's perfect sedan yeah they're they're perfect um but yeah
and like you know they're unreliable or whatever but at least they're good when they run and like
that's the thing with british cars it's like they're not really good when they're running and
they just don't do that very often either yeah so i don't know there's a guy on the next block for
me who sometimes parks to citron yeah yeah it's kind of it's hilarious because it's like you know
huge american cars tiny french car huge american car so happy to see me if you get hit you die
instantly oh my god oh i think someone crashed into it and then he was off the street for a while
but he uh he fixed it because i saw it like two days ago so back out with a hammer um exactly but yeah
so so scoda swear at it in french yeah i i just i think it's interesting right to talk about scoda and
to talk about tartar as kind of like two two bookends right because um you have this not to get like to
weeb for central europe but like particularly in in like czechia and and in poland too um you have this
this situation where you have countries that were like uh insanely industrially and like technically
developed in a lot of ways that then got kind of like smothered by the nazis and then by like
communism i guess um and then kind of leapt out of it into neoliberalism and were ostensibly the kind
of like big winners of the end of communism right like the sort of like living standards dipped a bit
but didn't nosedive like they did in in the soviet union and now they're sort of like everyone's an app
developer or you know making gay porn and that's fine i guess but like uh you kind of it elides
some of the kind of inequalities happening within that process as well and it kind of suggests that
like okay well everything about communism was like not only like horrifically oppressive and mismanaged
but also like morally wrong to have even tried and it's like i don't think that that's fair i don't
think that that's really the official stance of this podcast is no no it wouldn't have come on
the official stance of uh popular culture is every single person in every single communist
culture uh country was murdered every single day by every single wild how much kgb officer for not
constantly praising comrade stalin um uh wild population turnover in those places
next slide please i i simply hand this one to you victoria okay this is i mean you want to talk
about a car that represents like the heartbreaking uh you know sort of end of communism era i think
you have to go outside the soviet block to yugoslavia yeah yeah well and that's the thing is like i think
that there's so many things about like yugoslavia that are so compelling to me because it was it was like
the the initial part of the third world right uh that was it was the first country to like not align
itself officially in either way um despite being communist and it did so because uh tito was an
absolute like i don't know uh chad yeah the word for it um and so much like fidel kind of chad based
socialism yeah like you know really and the thing is is like yugoslavia was needed him uh because it fell
apart and the minute he died um but before he died uh there was you goes uh the zastava automobile
company it was like yugoslavia's you know car company they licensed the fiat 128 so it's a fiat 128
um and the the part of this that made it interesting was you know it's cheap it's reliable it's the same
uh attributes as all the rest of the cars but yugoslavia had six member republics and so every
single one of those republics would have a hand in building this car so they would actually like
they would build electrical components in slovenia they'd build interiors in croatia uh they'd build
engines in bosnia macedonia would uh supply trim and like mirrors and you know finishing bits and then
a plant in serbia would actually assemble the whole thing so the the idea behind it was like
this is our national pride project uh to build this car together like the whole tito's whole
thing was brotherhood and unity right to to unite these six incredibly um tumultuous uh member republics
into one state so they all hated each other but they all love tito yeah exactly they hated each
other's guts but they love tito um and so they started building these uh in i think 79 or 80. yeah 1980.
um i'm reading my own article about it sorry it was easier than putting the entire body of the
article in the notes um you know so he he died in in may 1980 this car started rolling out in november 1980
um by 1982 uslavia's inflation rate was 40 percent um by the late 80s uh you know 60 of the country's
population under 25 couldn't get a job so you know it rapidly fell apart um and you know this would have
been just another forgotten like fiat clone if it had not been for uh the man known as malcolm
brickland who you could devote an entire episode to he's why we have subarus in america he's why we
have the brickland sv1 yeah i was about to say he invented lesbians he also almost killed subaru in
america uh he he imported the subaru 360 first and it was an absolute disaster and he left his partner
holding the bag and his partner actually somehow managed to save the company uh which is why subaru
of america is such a weird company that isn't really related to fuji heavy industries that build the
cars of japan i digress the man never like he got lucky enough times that he kept most of his money
and he was really good at running away from problems um he was the physical manifestation of
the share zone meme of just leave just walk out hit the bricks uh your car company's failing because
you imported a 360 cc uh car to america and it can't keep up with highways just just leave no one can stop
you uh so he decided especially not in that car it's bad to say yeah so so brickland in uh the mid 80s
decided that he would partner with zastava to bring the the yugo to the us um and the idea was like
this is just the cheapest thing you can buy there's nothing cheaper uh in after modifying it for emissions
and safety standards it cost three thousand nine hundred ninety dollars in 1986 the average new compact
car in 1986 cost 11 grand you can buy three yugos and have change yes and that was kind of that was like
they had ad campaigns that were like you you get two of these for the price of like you know a golf
or whatever um you know it granted it's it was a 1.1 liter carbureted in line four that had 55 horsepower
um so it was not exactly like a powerhouse of any kind um but they sold they sold 140 000 of them in
seven years which is pretty good for an import car that basically one lunatic decided he would bring in
um and like people generally liked them at first like owners were like these are like it's kind of
the same fondness for like early beetles where it's like yeah it's kind of shitty but like it's kind of
we didn't know about john lennon yet you know yeah uh yeah or uh or the other russian beetle
or or for none for his unfortunate views about jewish people yeah yes yeah yeah and we're going right back at
hitler all right yeah well there's there's there's two of you here i mean we're gonna get back to it
you've heard of dueling pianos i mean i guess in the last analysis he did kind of fight a duel with
himself that's a good point yeah yeah you know hitler's not all that bad he's the guy that killed
hitler yeah but he also killed the guy who killed hitler yeah uh yeah it's true he killed the guy who killed
the guy who killed we can keep going we can kill a couple other people too infinite hitlers a bunch
of my people yes yeah i think i think like a bunch of mine too like i think there's like a pretty good
reason to be bad at him recursive hitler okay um wrap this up i'm tired i'm sorry there's like 10 slides
left i know hitler inside your head it's 2 23 a.m nova's time this is the last one that's like long
that i actually wrote because i just love this car i'm sorry it fucking rolls um so the the only
part of the uh ownership experience that americans hated was the dealers of course uh because like
they were price gouging the shit out of people so like an owner's manual was a 75 option what um
because yeah because the dealers were like well you're you're poor we can fuck you over uh but like
people generally liked it um and then what ended up happening was uh so yugoslavia collapsed i don't know
if you're familiar with that part of it yeah well you know there's no tito left to hold it together
yeah yeah so literally so the other thing that was crucial as yugoslavia collapsed is it got sanctioned
and so parts just stopped like you couldn't like in in the member states of yugoslavia you can still
get parts of these things people still drive them today they love them you know they're a cheap piece
of shit but they're like a cheap piece of shit in the same way a lotta is or like an old jeep or
whatever it's like yeah i've got parts i can just keep fixing it and it just keeps going um i go
through about three alternators a year you know yeah yeah but like but you know in the us like
the dealers all stopped selling them they were all just like you know little tiny shady dealers
that didn't like have any ability to you know sustain without like active parts supply coming in
from yugoslavia uh and so the problem with this car specifically is the that 1.1 liter engine was
interference and it had a timing belt that needed to be changed every 40 000 miles so all of a sudden
your your car has like 10 000 miles left to live and you can't get a belt right and if you don't do
it it will explode um so people got pretty upset about that my uh my grandfather was born in detroit
bought american cars for as long as he lived and they all crapped out on him and then eventually he
bought a yugo and it worked okay um until one day they brought it back home and it wouldn't turn off
so i had to leave it there idling in the driveway until it ran out of gas
somehow my grandfather was convinced to buy another foreign car oh yeah which was a which
was a volvo 240 and he never bought anything other than volvos after that forever yeah just imagine
just imagine looking at the like yugo in the driveway still running and just see you think yeah die die
why would you die i do i do love the idea also that like yeah american cars were so shitty a yugo
got him to kind of consider anything else in the entire world and then he bought a volvo and was like
holy fucking cars could be like this wow cars could be good um yeah so i guess the other thing too with
the yugo is like i did actually drive this one and like yeah it's it it's kind of shitty inside it's
like if you've driven like a 70s chevette or something um it's very reminiscent of that like
it's it's really slow the transmission feels like garbage um it's it's just kind of like a cheap car
it's not like a good cheap car and the way like a civic is but then again a civic cost twice as much
as this um and so really it wasn't like like the car itself was not a failure the problem was that
communism failed the car that's that's my belief uh with the yugo is that like if if you go slav
if tito had somehow lived to be older than joe biden um and like you know and had started the eternal
like you know the yugoslavia i think that these i think you'd probably still have a lot more um
you'd be able to get it like a yugo euro box in the same way that you can get a skoda one you know
yeah yeah i think that people would like i don't think that these would be as reviled but the thing is
is like they were one of the very few communist cars that got imported to the us and so like and
they were cheap and so like they never were going to get good reputation right like even if they had
had better timing belts even if they had a chain design instead which to be fair was the original
fiat design so like the 128 had the same problem um they no one was ever going to give these any
credit because they just they had to represent a failed ideology it was the only thing we get our hands
on that was like a product of it so it just it's just it's american capitalist oorah
bullshit that these things are so looked down upon which i think is the case for a lot of these cars
um the problem of course my friend owns this car still and the problem he has is that he can't get
parts like that's the biggest thing like if you were in if you're in like you know serbia you can
just go you can drive one of these until you know you die because there's just they built three
quarters of a million of them before nato bombed the plant and they stopped being able to make them
yeah but you can't get like an alternator from serbia very easily even still no um so that's my
i don't know i it's it's one of those things where it's like it's a it's a cars at their best are a
reflection of culture um and this one is just a depressing reflection of the culture that collapsed
before it should have been like there's a bunch of dead people uh and also they made a car that
everybody laughed at i got i got some fun stuff that's some dessert for us okay all right i have
one in here too it's pretty fun if we go to the next slide motorsport because there was an unofficial
like unofficially sanctioned communist track racing formula called formula easter and this ran for like
a number of decades there is almost no information about it available on the internet in english at least
it's all on like links to dead forums of like pictures of romanian men building cars in their
garages um and there was a there was like a championship called the cup for peace and friendship
which ran around a like series of like autodromes in eastern europe oh hell yeah um and this this
formula formula easter um like uh basically different uh countries in the communist bloc would like
build open wheel racing cars um there was a kind of like standardized design based on what
like what the best bits of like all of the cars were uh like almost all of them used an east german
van chassis they almost all used like lada brake uh discs um and like um i forget where the calipers
came from stuff the biggest limiting factor weirdly enough was tires um because they just wouldn't make
racing slicks because there's no need to um and so you just have like this tiny dwindling supply of
them it's always something i i i really uh would love to know more about in the soviet union is how
people pursued their weird hobbies that you think here you know in the west you can only do through
like a lot of you know consumer bullshit like you know there there were like two official soviet model
train sets for interest for for yeah i mean i guess you just have to like hand make stuff weirdly you've got
to make all the shit yourself and i guess okay it's the soviet union uh one thing you don't have in
short supply is a bunch of industrial equipment it's true weirdly one exception to that is um uh
photography as a hobby there was like pretty much for its entire life there was like a lively uh
community of like amateur photography in the soviet union um even under like the most repressive bits
of it we talked about a bit on on photography um if we go to the next slide we can we can see one of
these like formula easter cars in action um weird as hell that it has sponsors on it even if it's
just the one sponsor um and we do that yeah i want to know what uh orwo is a film company yeah um i'm
not sure where orwo is um like which which country that is but yeah so um the latvians did very well
at formula easter because like latvia was less closed off than a lot of communist countries they had more
parts coming in uh also the east germans because again like consumer goods and stuff
um there's a pair of i think brothers the melchises um who like as racing drivers did like very well
in the like yeah cup for peace and friendship um you're setting me up very well yeah absolutely
because they got up to some other shit as well next slide yeah this is the melchus rs1000
uh oh she's beautiful the melchises yeah uh this slide is from the atc music video for all around
the world um which is why i know this car exists because when i was like 10 i heard that song i've
had it stuck in my head since then what does it remind me of and like as a 10 year old i was like i
don't know what that car is what the hell and i could not find any information about it for years and
then finally i eventually realized it was a it was an east german uh ladder frame oh boy
with a fiberglass body popped on top of it it's the serena sport again yeah it's it's just if they
built a hundred of these um they the melchises basically just built formula easter cars that
they would occasionally actually race in like western like first world quote unquote uh racing competitions
in like unofficially sanctioned like competitive uh you know like east versus west showdowns um but
they built a hundred of these like yeah they built a hundred of these like sports cars uh i i guess
ostensibly with the reason i love it very much like trainers for race car drivers like oh they got to
drive a fast car around so um give them a 68 three six eight a horse car three cylinder two-stroke hell yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
um i think in the notes i said this is a volkswagen beetle that went on pimp my ride but
somehow came out i'm just imagining i'm just imagining this i'm just imagining the sound that a two-stroke
engine makes in this a three-cylinder two-stroke engine like yeah it actually makes that noise whoever
yeah it's like super farty huns it's super farty huns um i would absolutely
fucking kill to drive one of these things it looks like it looks like a lot of fun it it it probably
i don't i couldn't find a curb weight for it but it's fiberglass and a ladder frame so it probably
weighs like six pounds um and it probably you know steers and handles like a golf cart so probably fun
incredible that's that's my that's that is the only communist sports car of note thanks to atc for that
there is another motorsport angle we go to the next slide um because one thing that some of
these cars did very well at sometimes officially was rallying right um lada in particular um like
even their later cars like the lada samura um they were able to like rally these quite effectively
because they don't die right like no matter what you do to them you can like drive them off a cliff
like six times a day it will still start it will still turn over and it will still drive
um and so it's not fast necessarily though you can get a surprising turn of speed out of some of
them because rally mechanics are uh sort of like powerful majors but like yes it's it's very very
reliable um and so uh there's like still a kind of like as a rallying tradition even though that's now
been taken over by like well it was immediately taken over by like alcoholic fins trying to get to the
sauna um alcoholic fins that's redundant yeah finn's looking for a more uh like looking for a
faster way to exit the planet by going sideways into a fir tree into the ass of timo um yeah but like
um it's like sort of like communist cars did very well in in rallying and that's that's my sort of
note about that and i think they look good as hell when they do oh yeah um next slide this car
looks great yeah um also uh since we mentioned buses the ass bus you know this is hungarian
hungary got bus in the sort of lottery uh where the czech's got a truck um and hungary is just like
you a bus country now um not the worst thing that the soviet union ever did to hungary but like you
know it's on the list i guess um icarus is the hungarian bus company um they just they design really
good buses i'm not sure if they still exist but um one of the things they do but one of the
actually the largest manufacturer of buses in the world still i believe this is this is an icarus 55
um which in hungarian i'm going to butcher the pronunciation it's called a faros which means
ass or ass cheeks yeah because for the obvious you put the engine at the back with a big like
grill on the back it looks it's got a big ass right it's it's a fun time um some of the other things
that some of the other greatest hits included one with like sir mixalot's tour vehicle one of their
other greatest hits this thing's predecessor just had like a kind of like glass ceiling and no air
conditioning so you just boiled in summer uh it's the soviet union it's not that warm yeah um next
slide so icarus was so big that they tried to get in the export market you might notice this is not a
russian phrase this is this is this is from a better timeline yeah yeah this is did you hear
what craig said this morning on 62 kgw you're telling me the jansen beach center isn't located in central
stalingrad it was a 76 too um so uh this this is a trimet which is the uh portland uh transit authority
crown icarus 280 bus huh um so in the united states we got soviet buses in the 80s ran them until
the late 90s i think even up until like 2003 um and so this was uh a joint venture where you know
icarus had this these these very good buses that were used you know not just in soviet countries but in
european countries in general um you know they tried to expand to the american market so they get some
of that you know you love that hard currency right um and this was a joint venture between the then
uh flagging crown crown coach corporation which does this say had never built a transit bus am i reading
that right oh yeah man okay so crown coach had never built a transit bus that but they had built school
buses right okay um and icarus was the largest bus manufacturer in the world but it never entered
the u.s market um so these things were the shell was built in budapest um the the suspension you know
the engine so on and so forth um and then they shipped them out to los angeles where they finished
the interior this reminds me of when uh alpha and nissan collaborated but they use but they let alpha wire it
you know how well that was when you know the the chefs are german etc etc yeah um they produced
these from 1979 to 1986 uh their biggest operator was trimet in portland oregon they had a lot of
teething problems with things like the doors getting stuck and the windows falling out but they eventually
did fix that problem um because they ran them again until like 1999 which is for a transit bus that's
actually a pretty respectable amount of time total hungarian cultural victory yes there's no place
to put your bike on the front but uh that had that that i hadn't been a thing yet i think you probably
could put a bike rack on the front yeah previously at the time uh at the time they made these if a bike
got on the front of a bus because they had run over the cyclist yes um so this this sort of joint venture
i mean they sell a lot of buses it's successful enough that it the the whole company was spun off
into american icarus right um they start producing transit buses to icarus designs domestically in the
united states um later renamed themselves north american bus industries uh which only went bust a couple
years ago i think huh um and of course one of the things these buses are known for are they're
nice really huge windows um neat yeah and the north american bus it's not not uh representative of the
quality of the product would rather every north american bus manufacturer has gone bankrupt now except for
gillig and new flyer how's that gillig we're down we're down to two we're down to two
oh they were acquired by new flyer in 2013. that makes sense yeah sort of a boeing airbus situation
they should stop they should make more buses in the u.s mm they should not review buses we barely make
buses in this country anymore like once again the chinese bus industry is like the industry for buses now
uh we cannot we cannot allow a bus gap so you if you if you're in hungary right now you are crying into
your goulash about the fact that like uh like chinese bus manufacturers are doing a better job
than you well no they still have icarus um in hungary they're still making the good buses there
we just don't get to have them anymore you're like eating your goulash nervously yeah you have one eye
on the sort of like competition but yeah that's that's uh one of the few uh soviet exports the united
states much like the yugo oh yeah um and then oh the fun stuff this could have been the whole episode
in itself i'm just gonna list these off real quick the the big the big stuff uh that's a core competency
um so uh i need a grinder bio that just says that uh huh yeah yeah um so clockwise to the top left this
is a kiravets k700 again farming simulator unplayable until they add these um these are
absolutely beloved by like east german boomer farmers because you can roll coal in them and they
do yeah you can see like you can see tractor pools all men are brothers right we they're like every
every person enjoys a tractor um and everyone enjoys like triggering and owning greta thunberg whatever
so you can see these things at like sort of county fairs essentially in like east in the former east
germany uh just like lighting these things up like huge plumes of like black smoke coming out of
them um yeah i'd love to go i'd love to go i'd love to go in an east german tractor pool that sounds
this is i tell you what this will plow the fuck out of your field right like another another grinder
by this is not a metaphor um if you if you want to absolutely like decimate your topsoil there is none
finer um and then on on the sort of top right here we have the largest um like the largest um like
the largest dump truck ever built another grinder bio um this is uh this is a bella's a bella russian
automotive plant uh 75710 you may notice it is fucking huge um again this is potato yeah yeah to
transport like a massive load of potato um and like again this is like one of the things that like
belarusian industry it like has left uh is the big trucks and they're very proud of them um the bottom
right we have a a transporter erector launcher uh which it carries a very long missile tube which can
then erect to um fire an icbm at you killing you um these things are great i love them they got like
crew quarters in the back because they're so fucking big um wow and yeah the idea is it makes the nuclear
missile like harder to destroy ahead of time because it drives around um and then bottom left
we have a an a euro ural truck uh which is just like the the workhorse kind of like um sort of
light to medium truck of like soviet militaries and then post-soviet militaries and they also make
cool bikes yes they do they make the bikes of the sidecars yeah the full rear like a stolen bmw
which but they sold from the nazis so who cares um yeah exactly uh and they did it better yes yeah
uh next slide please i just put this in because i think the tetra eight by eight is cool beautiful
yeah beautiful those big fucking tires look how big it is it's got lots of tires it's got a snowplow
it's gonna fuck up the snow it's a fire truck it's gonna fuck up the fire look it's it's it's got missiles
it's gonna fuck you up um one thing i like what i really like is how big the windows are on all of
these including the armored one like the windows are still big big sort of like manhole cover um
yeah when when i was a kid like one of the things that i i vaguely remember is like children's
entertainment was like vhs tapes and books and stuff that's like uh cool massive trucks from around
the world which my parents like got me in an attempt i guess to forestall the burgeoning
transsexuality um and unfortunately what they made was was a woman who still likes the like giant
machinery um another grinder buyer um and yeah so i i just think that this stuff is neat um still
marge holding a potato i just i much holding like seven hundred eight thousand tons of potatoes in the
back of a massive uh lorry yeah my parents did the same thing interestingly i watched nascar as a little
child and like look at me the thing i was disappointed at here is when i was like putting
together this slide i put a big picture of the doof wagon in and i realized that was not built on a
tetra eight by eight that was built on a man eight by eight depressing yes so yeah unfortunately man is uh
that that is that is i think man is german yeah uh well no men are from mars uh women are for venus
i believe of course uh so i guess man is martian you're a truck simulator literally unplayable because
they refuse to add any of the interesting manufacturers and instead they're just like
more scania's uh you know give me some older shit give me the evicos and whatever anyway give me some
weird stuff you read the tartar um next slide please final slide we're so nearly done um yeah so uh this
could be a presentation in itself right but like the post-communist russian car industry is weird as hell
because it's really like living in the ruins of something that wasn't that great in the first place
um like i'm american i can imagine that yeah exactly right like it very similar sort of design
language in the way it's like every actually bmw kind of does this too and a lot of this is like
filtered through like russian envy of germans which is a whole other thing in itself of being like we
have to make the car look evil right uh so like so much of this stuff is um we have done an evil like
oligarchical facelift and it's still the same car underneath right um these these here are the
convertible versions of um an auris senate um which was built more or less specifically for
putin to have something cool to ride around in um he gave one to kim jong-un uh actually and then gave
another one to kim jong-un um it's it's like it's got like vw in there somewhere but it's they're
basically like bespoke um and then there's a bunch of like weird gazes that are all like kind of
facelifts it was like a a badge engineered chrysler sebring yeah um yeah the guys see
bear i believe um yeah just sebring annoyed which wasn't even a good car to badge engineer from us
like my god going to the country that makes only cars and asking for their shittiest car
i know i would be i would be very annoyed if someone gave me a car one year and then gave
me the same car the next year you're like i only got one parking spot note to listeners i would not
be annoyed you can feel free to give me two of the same car there is they did make a van
version of this just for the like russian secret service the fso uh called a oh god i want to say
like an auris arsenal or something which i think looks kind of good but evil but like all of them
are so leaning into are we going to make it look evil as like a prestige thing that's just kind of
pathetic at this point in the same way that like uh like rolls royce do to be honest which is another
thing like american pickup trucks yeah it's like you know russian expert in london drives uh evil
looking rolls royce or evil looking bmw comes back uh after all his shit gets sanctioned and it's like
how do we make it sort of autochthonous evil vehicle a global problem with evil looking cars for real
when they put the like hitler mustache back on the bmws that was that was a really like concerning
have you seen a new hyundai santa fe it looks like a cyberpunk like armored personnel carrier
oh what they have ads with vikings in them it's concerning that the the headlights say h and h for
highland hitler well you would know that's actually for hitler and hitler because there's two of them
yeah you've heard of holler and hollas my hitler and hitler side by side shotgun yeah oh hey you're
here on wtyp time for hitler and hitler in the morning imagine dragons starts playing
