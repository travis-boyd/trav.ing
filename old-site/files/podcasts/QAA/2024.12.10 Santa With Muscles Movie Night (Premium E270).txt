Welcome to the QAA Podcast Premium Episode 270,
The Santa with Muscles Movie Night.
As always, we are your hosts, Jake Rakitansky,
Liv Akar, Julian Field, and Travis View.
Ho, ho, Hulk Hogan, listeners.
Wow.
Some of you know him from growing up watching WWF as a kid.
Two of you had sex with him in wrestling buddy form.
And all of you watched in horror as he became a MAGA mascot,
ripping off his shirt at a Trump rally,
eyes bulging out of his head screaming,
Let Trump-a-mania, run wild, brother.
When I look out and I see all the real Americans,
I think about how Donald Trump,
his family was compromised.
When I look out there and I see Donald Trump,
I think about how his business was compromised.
But what happened last week when they took a shot at my hero?
And they tried to kill the next president of the United States.
Enough was enough.
And I said, let Trump-a-mania run wild, brother.
Let Trump-a-mania rule again.
Let Trump-a-mania make America great again.
You know what's funny?
I didn't even process that this movie had Hulk Hogan in it.
Wow.
Because I've never seen him not extremely old.
Like that Hulk Hogan is the only one I know.
You know, I mean, steroids really age you in a certain specific way.
You get real craggly.
Real leathery.
I do think one product of the fact that like most of the Trump celebrity endorsements
are like more kind of alternate media stuff
means that they're willing to do more ridiculous shit.
Beyonce would never do anything-
No.
An equivalent to that because she's Beyonce.
Why would she?
But Hulk Hogan, he's washed up.
Get on the loose.
Yeah.
Schwarzenegger, for example, was doing like Terminator lines.
Yeah.
But it was still subdued.
You know, it was a wink and a nod.
It wasn't a full-throated battle cry.
Yeah.
That's why fucking Schwarzenegger hates this era because he's like, oh, I totally ushered
this in and this is essentially just like the logical culmination of what I created and
I hate it.
I'm looking in the mirror.
We're going to talk about Arnold Schwarzenegger a little bit later.
So as someone who was born in the early 80s and was a casual appreciator of professional
wrestling, this timeline for me, as I said, couldn't get any weirder.
I remember playing the WWF arcade game.
I remember playing with a plastic wrestling ring at friends' houses.
I remember being called Jake the Snake by cousins and uncles.
And in those days, wrestling was just kind of in the background always.
It was extremely popular.
Even for me as like a kid in France, I like couldn't get access to any of the actual like
events because there's no way I could convince my parents to have like a cable box plus pay
for some sort of pay-per-view insanity.
It's a big ass.
And so I would like get the magazines to see the fight replays and stuff.
And I always thought Hulk Hogan was kind of not my favorite.
I don't know.
There's something about him.
He's like the Goku, right?
I'm more of a Vegeta guy.
I was definitely like an ultimate warrior guy.
I wasn't goth enough to like the Undertaker, but I definitely liked, you know, the kind of
alternate characters.
And I just remember him saying, you know, say your prayers and eat your vitamins.
And that was always like, hey, relax, buddy.
Don't fucking tell me what to do.
Yeah.
So always been a Christian.
I mean, he's had, you can see he's got the big cross around his neck when he's at that
Trump rally.
Huge, huge golden cross dangling from his neck.
When I was fucking Bubba the Love Sponge's wife, I was thinking I had Jesus in my heart and
my heart was about to explode.
Even if you weren't a diehard fan, it was pretty difficult to not know anything about
wrestling.
And of course, the biggest, most popular wrestler of them all, Terry Gene Bolia, aka Hulk Hogan,
the Hulkster, Hulkamania brother.
Even in my adult years, Terry was a central figure of my homie's group chat.
In 2013, really the last time my life wasn't dominated by thoughts of Clinton, Trump, and
conspiracy theories, Terry sued Gawker Media for $100 million for leaking gold.
portions of a sex tape recorded, he claimed, without his knowledge, between himself and
Heather Clem, wife of radio personality Bubba the Love Sponge.
That's hilarious.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now, according to the Hulkster, Heather had been coming on real strong and her husband,
Bubba, fully supported her having sex with his friend.
Hogan won the lawsuit and Gawker was forced to file for bankruptcy.
Little note here is that actually Peter Thiel found an opportunity to bankrupt Gawker for
essentially outing him as gay.
And he, you know, hooked up with Terry here.
Oh, interesting.
Interesting tidbit.
Hooked up with?
Mm-hmm.
My friends and I weren't so much into the sex itself contained in the tape, but instead
a handful of incredible quotes from Hulk Hogan caught on camera after the coitus.
Here are just a couple.
Liv, I'm assuming you've never heard these, so-
I don't think so.
Enjoy.
After finishing having sex, one of the first things Hogan says is that his condom almost
fell off during the sex.
He then slaps his belly and says, I can't believe I just ate.
Feel like a pig.
Oh, God.
He then heads off and takes a shower, and when he comes back, he continues to talk about
how full he is.
Quote, crazy.
Eating like a pig just 10 minutes ago.
He then says, feel like I just got off a roller coaster.
In the tape, Hulk inexplicably keeps talking about how he, quote, has to meet his son Nick
at midnight.
He keeps going like, I gotta meet Nick at midnight.
Like, it's very-
What the fuck?
It's just very bizarre.
And then he goes on to mention his son's girlfriend, saying, Nick's girlfriend is only 17.
She has a killer fucking body.
Oh, God.
He goes on.
He goes on.
The other night, Nick is out, and his dogs are playing tug-of-war with Nick's and his
girl's underwear.
Then Nick has another girl who's even hotter in Orlando.
Then she wants to be the first to get me if I'm divorced.
Hot commodity.
What?
So he's talking about his son's, I don't know, very young girlfriends vying to get with Hulk
now that he's divorced.
Oh, God.
I can't stress enough.
I really can't how wildly funny my friends thought this was.
Even to this day, someone will say, I have to go meet Nick at midnight when they're headed
home for the evening, pretending like we all still hang out.
There's no better name for essentially a cuck fetishist than Bubba the Love Sponge.
Correct.
Come clean up, Mr. Love Sponge.
Come clean it all up.
Absolutely.
And Hulk basically was, apparently Bubba's wife had been advancing on Hulk for a long time.
And Bubba was like, hey, man, hey, we support it.
And Hulk basically says that the night that the sex tape was filmed, without his knowledge,
that he was like kind of down.
He was like sort of down and out and kind of depressed.
And just she was able to kind of take advantage of him.
I was eating sashimi just 10 minutes ago.
Now I'm eating your pussy.
You're off.
That is the funny thing about like roided guys is how obsessed they are with eating.
Yeah.
Yes.
They're just thinking about it constantly.
That's also like one thing that they put in the movie is like his weird obsession with,
well, there's a bunch of, there's fat and there's cookies.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So it was to my great surprise that none of my friends had heard of Santa with Muscles,
a 1996 Christmas action comedy starring none other than Hogan himself.
And since we had so much fun doing a super melted Christmas movie night last year with
Keanu Reeves' Babes in Toyland, I figured we might as well continue the tradition.
I'm almost certain that was more than a year ago.
I think that was two.
Well, yeah, I've never been very good at knowing how much time has passed.
And honestly, this movie made me beg for Babes in Toyland.
I just would have loved to watch that instead.
So listeners, poke your fingers into those advent calendars, get your gifts to the post office
on time and prepare yourself for, to quote Liv Agar, genuinely the stupidest movie I've
ever seen.
That was my only comfort.
I was watching it.
I was like, I just know Liv is suffering at least that.
At least that, Lord.
That's so funny because I was watching it like wrapped, being like, I can't believe I've
never seen this.
This is so funny.
I texted my boys.
I was like, did you guys ever see the movie Santa with Muscles?
It's 1996 Hulk Christmas movie and it's unironically good somehow.
And my first buddy goes, I can't wait to watch it.
And then my other buddy goes, adding it to the Christmas season viewing schedule.
I don't know if Travis said it was good in our group chat to balance the episode out
so that Jake wouldn't be the only one on the other side here.
I don't care.
I'm always here.
Get my mail here.
It just never ceases to amaze me that I've been so fixated on figuring out what's inside
Jake's brain that I've ignored Travis, who's like the true Rubik's Cube of our podcast.
Travis, would you like your first line in the episode?
Yeah.
I mean, it was actually, I mean, it was better than I thought it would be.
I mean, there was like, there was some, yeah, like I said, there was some actually some pretty
cool choreographed fight scenes, you know?
And there was, you know, lots of like zany slapstick comedy, over the top campy performances.
It was a lot of fun.
Agree.
I think the movie is kind of like, in some ways, like not trying to be as funny as it
is.
There's a scene, a clip I'll play later that illustrates this very well.
To me, it feels like almost proto, like Tim and Eric style comedy, though, like chaoticness
and the way it's edited.
So where do I even begin?
This film released on November 8th, 1996, across 98 movie theater screens domestically.
It was directed by a guy named Jonathan Merlowski, who has made a nice career for himself directing,
made for TV films such as Cop Dog and Zombie Hamlet.
Nice.
It took three people to write this movie, Jonathan Bond, Fred Mata, and Dory Crum Raymond, which
is certainly not a real name.
And apparently the script went through so many revisions during the production process that
the original writer sued to have his name taken off the movie.
Oh.
One incredible fact is that this film was produced by Jordan Belfort, the actual Wolf of Wall
Street guy.
That makes perfect sense.
This also wasn't the first movie that Belfort and Hulk Hogan did together.
Earlier that year, the pair released a film titled The Secret Agent Club about an adult son
who finds his dad's secret laser gun.
I shit you not, that's all what the movie is about.
I just, 96, let's see, five years after the first Iraq invasion.
Yeah, it was the Clinton years.
I mean, it was a perfectly brain dead, like, peak of the economy moment for the United States
where they gave up on the labor unions and turned to neoliberalism.
Really the Tony Blair moment.
Really the moment where America reached up in its own nostrils and just scrambled that
prefrontal lobe.
Speaking of, what I think happened here, it starts with a C and rhymes with Spokane.
These boys are getting together.
They're on the slopes.
They are on the slopes.
They are on the slopes.
They're skiing.
They're skiing big time.
They're doing an insane amount of drugs.
They're coming up with fun little movies to make together.
Although the budget on Santa with Muscles has never been publicly released, the film opened
to pitiful ticket sales and reviews, earning just over $200,000 and was out of theaters in
two weeks.
Ouch.
Mm-hmm.
Unfortunately, the multi-million dollar production Jingle All the Way, a better Christmas action
movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, released on November 16th, just a week after Hulk's
movie, absolutely destroying him.
Brutal.
In fact, one film critic, Chris Hicks, wrote that Hulk's performance in Santa with Muscles
makes, quote, Arnold Schwarzenegger seem like Laurence Olivier.
Ha ha!
It is true.
Like, it is wild.
I mean, Hulk Hogan looks like he's forcing himself to be comfortable around children like
half the movie.
Yes, yes.
Undoubtedly, the worst part of the movie is Hulk Hogan.
He really cannot act his way out of a paper bag in this, probably due to the insane amount
of drugs he and Jordan Belfort were doing during production.
Yeah, no, totally.
He's got real shaky energy and just looks bad.
Like, he looks, like, weird and bad the whole time.
The rest of the cast is solid.
Don Stark plays a shopping mall elf with a gambling debt.
You have Ed Begley Jr. playing the villain.
Clint Howard, Ron Howard's brother, as the befuddled police officer.
And even a very young Mila Kunis in one of her very first acting roles.
So, a star is born.
This is amazing that this was basically her debut.
This is amazing.
I can't believe I found it.
This is as good as finding, like, a five-year-old Drew Barrymore in Babes in Toyland or a 23-year-old
Keanu Reeves.
I will say that, like, Ed Begley Jr.'s, like, first-in-command, this, like, British doctor
guy, I just wanted him off the screen every time he was on it.
Just an unpleasant experience to watch him act.
Oh, he's an unpleasant guy for sure.
And Ed Begley Jr. is hilarious, though.
He delivers every line like a deer in headlights, and he's constantly, like, sending messages
to people through TV screens that his henchmen are holding.
It's actually, I don't know, I loved it.
I'm pretty sure Jordan and Hulk, like, got to the bottom of the slopes and just kind of
stopped sideways and just blew a lot of snow into Ed Begley's face.
So, the movie currently has a score of 23% on Rotten Tomatoes, which I think is a little
low.
I'd personally give it about a 6 out of 10 if you saw it in 96, and a 7 out of 10 now.
And as far as shit that I've had to watch for the podcast, 8 out of 10.
I've never watched a longer hour and a half movie.
Michael Flynn's documentary was, like, produced with more knowledge than this one.
This was insane.
There were scenes that...
There were close-up scenes of Hulk Hogan in a conversation that were just completely out
of focus.
Like, just incompetence at every level.
So, the movie begins with a voiceover from the saddest, littlest Christmas orphan, and
she's writing a letter to Santa.
Dear Santa, how are you?
I'm not doing so well.
There is this really, really bad man named Ebner Frost who lives up on the hill.
He's got these weird people working for him, and I think they're going to do something really
bad this Christmas.
This is us, by the way.
Yeah, this is us now, yeah.
Santa, I'm not doing so well.
There's some really bad man up on the hill, and he's got weird people working for him, and
I think they're going to do something really bad.
That's how I feel going into this next year.
A hundred percent.
We then cut to Hulk in what I thought was some kind of Delta Force mission.
He's wearing a wrestling tank with Desert Storm fatigues, and I'm like, okay, he's a spy guy.
He's going to be a spy guy that becomes Santa Claus through wacky circumstances.
He is coming up on a mansion surrounded by green plants and green grass, and he is in desert
camo.
It's amazing.
It's really like, you know, it's the idea that maybe the suburbs could be visited by
one of these Desert Storm guys.
But then the people that he's fighting are ridiculous.
There's a chef with a big Ratatouille chef's hat who attacks him with a tenderizer, and there's
a butler, and it's just a totally insane fight scene.
So I'm like, okay, is he a movie star?
It's like, he's in a movie.
He's doing a scene.
You know, who is this guy?
I wrote down, he beats the hell out of various service workers, gardener, chef, driver, a
screaming mechanic, a butler.
He basically kicks the asses of the entire lower floor of Downton Abbey as practice.
Yes.
And then you realize that he's not on a mission at all.
It's just some sort of like workout drill where Celebrity Hulk pays the help to fight
him in the backyard of his mansion.
Yeah, he pays them to get their asses beat by him.
It's such a weird discordant cut when they end it.
It's like, okay, I don't know the direction this movie is going at all anymore.
Never mind.
I'm not sure that even mattered at all in the end.
No.
Like it didn't set anything up particularly.
It just sets up that he's like a rich asshole because he like makes comments about like,
oh, you're just being nice because you want to raise.
And like, it makes it clear that he's a guy who's like, you know, miserly and very wealthy.
Yeah.
And he's got all of his own products.
Like he's got protein powder.
It's like almost like Newman's own.
Yeah.
Like it seems like they borrowed that, that he's got his face on all of these various food
products.
And he's not happy with how he looks on it.
Yeah.
A real piece of shit.
Then inexplicably Hulk and his boys go motorcycle paintballing.
Like this is another thing that they do that there.
He's like, all right, you know, it's kind of like, um, blank check.
Like, you know, imagine a little kid in a huge mansion with endless funds, the type of stuff
that he would want to do.
So it seems like the next thing he likes to do is load up a paintball gun and shoot his
surface workers.
Yeah.
There's this that I wrote down.
I love that Hulk Hogan is basically playing himself a California Republican piece of shit
who sees the world as this playground and as a libertarian when it's convenient.
Yeah, totally.
The villain who comes up at Begley Jr.
is essentially a kind of more evil guy.
He's like Poppy Bush.
So this is kind of a Reagan versus Bush and the idea that Reagan could become nicer through
CTE and turn into Bill Clinton.
And then he's got a bunch of like phrases, almost like he's like Mao with his red book
that he's made all of his henchmen memorize.
Like, no, rule 80.
If you have any doubt, get out.
It's like shit like that.
The most brain dead shit though.
Like there's not even like an ounce of wisdom or thought.
Like it is, this movie has like the writing of a cocaine addict.
It's just so scattered and all over the place.
And they kind of forget that.
Like, does that ever come back at all?
The quotes?
It's just to show what type of guy he is.
No, not really.
No.
They do kind of a good job at tying off most of the loops in the movie, which I was very
impressed at.
I was like, oh damn.
I'm like, there's actually way more thought went into such a bad movie than I expected.
But the rules, at some point, I mean, at some point towards the end of the movie, he's like
talking to the children and he's like, well, if you're afraid, then you'll never get paid.
Like he does do his rule, but they don't come back to help him.
Like they don't come back in a way that's meaningful that a qualified script writer would have.
They wouldn't have put in the movie if they weren't going to pay it off.
One of the few times where AI would have made a movie better.
Yeah, probably.
So there's this kind of wild motorcycle chase scene and stunt scene where they're shooting
off the paintball guns.
They're driving through the California dunes.
And then one of them lands on the hood of a cop car driven by Clint Howard, Ron Howard's
brother.
If you saw him, you would recognize him immediately.
He's in tons of movies, an absolute legend.
He's been around forever and he always plays great characters.
And this movie is no exception.
He's basically kind of like a low T cop who has self-esteem issues.
And he's worried that he's not tough enough to be a police officer.
He's got a lot to prove.
I wrote down that like the movie is somehow deeply cynical.
Like everyone's like either a sniveling coward or greedy or just like an awful human being.
But there are also no real consequences.
Like you can basically like go to war with the cops, like with paintball guns and the cops
like, you know, there's no like you're going to get shot in this process, which I think
is like very much of the era.
It's like, yes, everyone is a thief or a liar or a greed head, but they're not evil.
Like there's no actual absolute evil.
There's no consequences.
There's no death.
You know, everything's just like a fun WWE cartoon violence thing.
Yeah.
Even when the guns and the bazookas eventually come out, there's clearly like the trauma of
Desert Storm like lingering over the movie.
And it does not know how to process it other than like, OK, clothesline somebody Hulk.
I wasn't alive in this period.
But like looking at media from when it was produced, I can only describe it as like a
stupid optimism.
Yes.
Like it's optimism, but there's no consideration for like the world and actual consequences.
It's just like fun.
Yes.
It's the beginning of the fugue state where you're still having fun.
Yeah.
He's just so happy to be at like four stars in GTA.
Yes.
It's just like cool fun.
Yeah.
Because he will never die.
Like this is a movie about how we will never die.
This is when America turned its back on the idea of death and said, history has ended.
We're fine.
Damn.
Relevant.
Especially in relation to like his, I guess, henchman later on, the guy who finds him,
like the overall message there is like, well, he's incredibly selfish and he tries to
fuck over Hulk Hogan, but it all works out in the end.
Yes.
Yes.
It's like our selfish capitalist interests.
Like we try to fuck over each other, but somehow end up in this like equitable moral state.
Yes.
Genuine evil will always work itself out.
Yeah.
There is no true evil at the core of the American heart.
It's actually just fear of economic insecurity that will then eventually become like good hearted
bonomi.
Do you guys think that that was his real Hummer, the black Hummer that he's driving around?
I have to imagine that he wanted his own cars and stuff in the movie.
Yeah.
No, totally.
Maybe his own mansion too.
He definitely like just came up with shit he wanted to do.
Like, can we just fucking shoot some like, you know, paintball guns?
Yeah.
I want to beat up the whole staff.
I'm like, can we just, he's like a giant adult baby, like playing with his toys.
So after he jumps out of his moving vehicle, Hulk Hogan escapes into the mall where a crisis
is taking place.
Santa has not shown up to take pictures with the kid.
The coordinator, who I think she's not credited, but I think that's a very young Anne Heche,
I think.
I'm not 100% sure on that, is desperate to find a Santa replacement.
One of the elves in Santa's village is on the phone trying to reason with some kind of bookie.
And it's the classic Rakatansky gumshoe voice.
I was, I was delighted to discover.
Yes.
This is awesome because he's New York coded, but it's like 100% in LA.
California, yeah.
Everything is just bright, sunny Pasadena.
And yeah, this guy is just like some sort of lost New Yorker.
Yeah.
And it's the first thing you see when they cut to like the chaos inside, you know, the sort
of little hut where the elves are getting ready, you know, to set the kids up for the
pictures.
Like it's the, you open essentially on like a guy who's like, yeah, my gambling problems.
Here's the clip.
It's funny.
It's funny because essentially, yeah, like you're a bad guy if you're like a kind of like
New York guy down on his luck in the, like the old, like film noirs of the fifties.
But then like you evolve into like a sunny California guy eventually.
At the end, he's literally suntanning.
Yeah, that's true actually.
Wow.
It's like, yeah, being a good American means becoming like a nice tanned Reaganite.
How's it looking out there, huh?
Pretty bad?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
No problem.
It's no problem.
I just ran into a streak of bad luck.
That's all.
I'll have the money for you today.
I promise.
Listen up.
I've got 50 bucks for the first elf that brings me Santa Claus.
I can do that.
It appears my luck may have just changed.
Like why do the elves have to all be, they're gambling and Santa's too drunk to show up.
Like they wanted this movie to be like, I don't know, gritty in some way.
Yeah.
Bad Santa or something like that.
Yeah.
None of that like works itself out because it's a children's movie essentially.
And she's like, I'll give the first elf 50 bucks, 50 big smackaroos to find me a new Santa.
Yeah.
That was like $5,000 in the 90s.
So we then cut to the first appearance of the main villain of the movie, Ebner Frost or Mr. Frost.
This is the wealthy guy up on the hill with the weird people that the little orphan mentions in the opening voiceover of the film.
Yeah.
Patrician Poppy Bush.
Yeah.
The kind of East Coast like snooty elite.
This happens to be the same guy who the elf owes money to.
And he's in the process of torturing like a shoe store owner to get him to sell him his business.
Yeah.
And this is where you meet like, yeah, the cast of characters that are, I mean, I can only describe them as like some of the lowest IQ like children's villains.
Like only would function if they were cartoons.
They're like Batman 50s series TV show villains.
Like dancing around like chickens.
One of them looks like he's doing a racist caricature of a Chinese person.
He just has like the awful buck teeth, like fake teeth.
And then like he's like squinting his eyes constantly and going.
Hi, I'm Dr. Blight, Mr. Frost's personal physician.
And Mr. Frost will be with you in just a moment.
Comfortable?
Get me out of here.
Get me down.
Anything I can get you?
Coffee, tea, aspirin.
Good.
Enjoy.
Hey, where are you going?
Let me down.
Mr. Raffini, I'm Ebner Frost.
I'm so glad you could make it.
I do hope we can reach an agreement on the sale of your shoe store.
I'm not selling my shoe store.
Where are you going?
Come on.
Get me out of here.
Where are you going?
Don't.
Don't leave me.
The villain's house has random metal tubes just shooting steam up.
Yeah.
What do you think that is?
It's just cartoon shit.
So we're back in the mall and Hulk's, he's still on the run from the cops.
And he sees a vacant Santa suit hanging in the back rooms.
So he ducks, he ducks into this room.
He comes out into the Santa suit and the cops are like, hey, Santa, you seen a guy in a
Desert Storm outfit go this way?
And he like, you know, they're total idiots.
He instantly confuses them.
But then he proceeds to treat a little kid and his and like assault his father like 10
feet away.
So the cops are like, wait a minute, that's the guy.
No, he also has like a, the Desert Storm camo hanging out the back of his outfit.
Yeah.
He's got, yeah.
He's got like it, like it's some sort of like diaper.
Yeah.
Like a, yeah.
Like a flappy diaper hanging out the back of the suit.
It makes no sense.
But what really gets them to notice is the fact that some kid comes out and he's like,
oh, Santa, I've waited for so long.
And, and he, Hulk Hogan is basically like, get lost kid.
And the father's like, and the father's like, hey, what are you doing?
And he like shoves the dad out of the way, which is peculiar behavior for mall Santa,
which kind of clues the cops in.
So in, in trying to escape, uh, he jumps down a garbage chute and, uh, Hulk is plopped out
at the feet of the down and out elf who proceeds to steal his wallet.
When Hulk Hogan wakes up, he has no memory of who he is.
And the elf tells him he's Santa Claus.
So this is, this is like, I think where you have to do like a Rocky horror picture show
and give yourself a concussion.
Yeah.
At the same time to enjoy the rest of the movie.
It's really where like this, the tone of the movie is set where it's like, oh, we're
doing this.
Okay, sure.
Yeah.
Okay.
He, he hit his head.
He doesn't remember who he is.
And the elf is like, eh, you Santa.
Another drunk mall Santa.
Well, you'll do.
You're a big one, aren't you?
Uh.
Oh.
Merry Christmas.
Merry, Merry Christmas, average.
And Mr. Frost will pulverize me.
I'm a snappy dresser too.
Why?
Don't mind if I do.
Oh, answer to my prayers.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr.
Blake Thorne.
Richest man in dead states.
Blake Thorne.
I'm rich.
I'm richer than rich.
I'm too rich.
Visa.
Mastercard.
American Express.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
Merry Christmas to all.
These are the same sounds that Hulk made fucking Bubba the Love Sponge's wife.
I realized the premise of this is basically that Hulk Hogan gets the severance procedure.
Like fire getting CTE or brain damage or whatever.
It's like, I know everything except who I am.
What is my purpose?
It's like to be Santa Claus.
Maybe the only good message in the movie is that to make a rich guy into a good person,
you need to give them a concussion.
I also love that when he looks in the wallet and says that he's rich, there's like 175 bucks
in there, maybe.
Yeah.
Well, again, in the 90s, that was like $2 million.
Yeah.
I went and bought like a couple like vitamins and some like medicine and stuff at Walgreens
the other day, and it was like close to 175 bucks.
So I thought I would make it through this episode without smoking, but I had to go get
my cigarettes just to cope here.
Yeah, you got to.
If I was still smoking, I'd fucking be right there with you, man.
Between you and Travis, I feel like I'm getting Eiffel Towered here, like fucking Pokemon and
then this.
Oh, I wrote in my notes.
Oh, great montage with Santa and the kids asking for presents, mostly because it's like
you said, Julian, like Hulk is clearly uncomfortable around the kids and the kids are really funny.
Like it seems like most of the boys are just genuinely overjoyed to meet Hulk Hogan.
And so all the children are better actors than Hulk is.
Yeah.
This is maybe like the moment where the movie makes the most sense, where it's like, okay,
this is like a movie about what if this wrestling himbo was trying to be Santa.
And there's something there.
Yes, I agree.
But of course, this is really not where the movie goes at all.
Also in this scene, you have a very young, probably like five or six years old, Brenda
Song, who like has gone on to become like a huge actor.
She's also married to Macaulay Culkin.
So like all of these little celebrities kind of like buried in this bizarre movie.
Yeah.
A lot of the kids end up having careers.
Yeah.
Yeah.
A lot of the kids do.
Adam Wiley, who's one of the orphans.
So then, you know, as Santa is, you know, desperately trying to figure out what to say to these
children as they're asking him for Christmas presents, I guess two of the elves that we
saw earlier in Santa's kind of cabin or whatever are now in plain clothes and they're trying
to rob the charity bucket.
These elves are such pieces of shit.
Like everybody who works in the mall is like a thief or a liar.
One of them has a nose ring.
These are kind of classic like 90s beat them up style thugs.
Yeah.
These are bebop and rocksteady kind of guys.
One of the guys has a dare t-shirt and then the other one has an anarchy shirt.
Of course, a fight scene ensues because the little girl's like, Santa, somebody's trying
to steal the charity for the children.
And like Hulk Hogan stands up and there's a music cue and you're like, oh, like he's found
his purpose, which is to beat up anybody who is doing naughty naughty on Christmas.
You really should have leaned into that more.
I feel like it could have been a much better film.
They really should have.
Because just recognize what you are, which is like very stupid Christmas movie.
And just him just going all across the city, not knowing who he is.
Yeah.
A concussed Hulk Hogan trying to be like a professional mall Santa is a very interesting
idea and totally squandered.
If Arnold had done it, it would have been awesome.
They wanted to have too much fun.
They weren't thinking about the audience.
They were thinking about how much fun can Hulk Hogan and Jordan Belfort have with all of
their money.
It's like, yeah, paintball on motorcycles, like beating up, beating up these guys.
Oh, there's like, we can use Jordan's mansion for the evil henchman's hideout.
Like, yeah, we've got a group of mad doctors.
Like, they just, they were being too goofy with it.
After the fight, Hulk notices the sign from the charity booth, which reads,
The Mission, referring to the orphanage.
But in Hulk's concussed brain, he interprets it as some kind of call to action.
And he asks Lenny to take him to the mission and the pair speed off on a moped together.
Now, there's not a ton of great dialogue in this clip, but I had to play
it for you guys because I'm pretty sure it's a fake dummy on the back of the motor,
of the moped as it drives away.
And it looks so funny.
A visual reference for us that the audience has know.
This, this checks out.
You know, you're absolutely right.
The mission could be kind of like your local office.
Let's get out of here.
If I'm Santa, where's my sleigh?
It's getting new brakes.
Listen, Rudolph's got this stomach thing.
I got something better.
Let's ride.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that's probably just a dummy on the back.
That's a good call.
Also, the New Yorkie, like, elf helper guy is trying to get Santa, Hulk Hogan, to, like,
put his thumbprint into the machine somehow so he can steal all of his money.
Like, that's why he's with him this whole time is to steal all of his money.
They had to, like, make a science fiction element to the movie to make this work, where the ATM
for very rich guys has a thumbprint scanner.
Oh, yeah, which didn't, that, I don't think that existed.
It also still doesn't exist.
It's also, it's so funny that you can tell this is bad, bad, bad script writing, because
in this kind of transition scene, they're trying to sort of set up the next element of
the plot where he goes, hey, the mission can sort of be like your headquarters.
It's like, well, yeah, because that's where they're going to be for, like, the next, like,
25 minutes of the movie is, like, operating out of this orphanage, essentially, as Santa's,
you know, because they can't have him going back to his mansion, because then he'll figure
out who he is, because his waitstaff, who, by the way, are not looking for him at all.
I mean, I don't even know why I'm trying to, you know, find the logic in some of this.
Right as Santa and Lenny arrive at the mission on Moped, a group of evil scientist henchmen
are tearing down a statue outside the church.
For what purpose?
I am not sure.
Maybe intimidation?
Yeah, that's, they want to clear the land for the rich guy to have it.
It's like the last part of his evil plan.
He wants to control the whole neighborhood.
I thought that this scene was unintentionally funny and very hilariously edited.
It felt to me almost like a proto Tim and Eric, or even I think you should leave a Tim
Robinson style comedy.
One of my favorite scenes in the movie.
And this is the first time that you are introduced to the orphans and their headmaster.
And I guess the groundskeeper, Clayton, he sort of just says like, he's like, she runs
the school, but like, I've been here since the beginning.
And his character is very racist.
Oh, yeah.
What I like here is you get to see a kind of subconscious 90s representation of what a good
guy is.
And I took some notes here about what they consider to be a good guy.
So 90s good guy.
He's pro recycling.
He's against junk food because it has fat in it.
He's pro charity.
And he saves an elderly black man from getting run over.
I love that.
Like, it seems like a lot of the scenes of these films were just like just in open streets
in the San Fernando Valley.
Like they just wandered outside and started filming.
This is Pasadena.
I'm pretty sure it's a very common place to film these kinds of movies.
But yeah, somewhere somewhere somewhere like that, at least.
So Clayton informs Santa Claus that the scientists hijacking the statue work for Mr. Frost.
The kids then present Santa with cookies and milk.
But Hulk's healthy lifestyle begins to try and claw its way out through his amnesia.
It's like severance rules for your personhood.
Like you have all of the things about you that you remember, but you don't remember who you
are.
Who are those guys anyway?
The scientists?
Oh, they work for Mr. Frost.
He's been clearing out the whole neighborhood and no one knows why.
Now he wants the orphanage.
And he'll get it too.
Shut up.
He will not.
Sounds like a very naughty boy.
Oh.
Oh, thank you.
What's the matter, Santa?
Don't you like chocolate chip?
I don't think so.
I mean, are these good for you with all the fat?
Santa, don't you remember?
You love cookies.
Oh, yeah.
Mrs. Claus has to hide them from him.
Otherwise, he blows up like a blimp.
Boop!
Here, have some milk.
Is this low fat?
Okay, everybody, let's set the table and watch.
It's jerk chicken night.
The writer's room, like, what's a black thing?
Yeah, the whole point of that character, it's like the older black man who imparts practical
knowledge onto the protagonist.
Like you said, Liv, the logic here is so crazy.
He knows everything about life, but he also suddenly believes that Santa Claus is real and
that he might be Santa Claus.
What the fuck kind of amnesia is that?
It is the perfect, like, Hulk Hogan acting role because it's just, like, confused and
kind of lifeless.
Just like, what's going on?
I don't understand.
Yeah.
They should have had a rubber man play his role, like one of those, like, crash test dummies
or the, like, things that you punch that are in the shape of a human.
So Santa and Lenny get invited to stay at the orphanage with the three leftover kids who
they haven't found homes for yet.
While there, Lenny realizes he can steal Hulk's thumbprint off of a milk glass and empty his
bank account.
So he's still, you know, plotting and scheming how he can take this rich guy for all of his
money.
Welcome, Lenny, to the United Banking System's Prince Secure Teller.
For a hundred gazillion dollars, please place your stolen thumbprint on the scanner.
Thank you for doing business with us and have a nice life in South America.
Okay, so that's Lenny fantasizing as he's watching Hulk Hogan put his thumb on the glass
of milk and drink it in slow motion.
But here's a question for everybody.
Why at the end of that did the writers go, have a nice life in South America?
Because if you're a super wealthy person that's living in South, that has moved to South America,
like, that's his goal?
Well, that's where you can't find him.
He's stolen this rich guy's money.
What do you mean?
Yeah.
It's a place to go if you're a criminal.
It's a fantasy of, like, yeah, moving somewhere where the American law can't reach you because
he's like, well, he's stolen all this money, but he's gotten the hell out of the U.S.
before, you know, anyone can sort of figure out what he's done.
Oh, okay.
That makes sense.
Also, in this scene, it is very clear why Hulk Hogan doesn't cut it as, like, a Schwarzenegger
type, like, very strong guy.
Is that he has a scrawny ass neck.
His sport is fake.
He doesn't, his muscles, like, are just like, he does, like, arm day every day, and that's
about it.
Yeah.
Fake bodybuilder.
Yeah.
Weird, like, scrawny little bird neck.
And, yeah, you just don't, you don't have that with Schwarzenegger.
My man looks solid from every angle because he's a professional bodybuilder, and so he
needs to look good from every angle.
This is also where Mila Kunis' character is revealed to be some kind of seamstress.
She, you know, she cuts off the, she's like, oh, I remade your Santa outfit for you to,
like, show off your muscles, and it's like a sleeveless Santa tank, basically, that he
then wears for the rest of the movie.
And they ask her, where did you learn this?
And she just holds up, unexplained, but just a comic book, like, or something like that?
Yeah, yeah, it's a comic book.
She learned it from a comic, totally inexplicable.
Yeah, just, like, moving on.
Thank you.
Jordan Belfort was like, kids learn shit from comics all the time, right?
Right?
Right?
Hulk, pass me that fucking platter.
That was not milk.
It was just, like, water mixed with cocaine.
The kids are very brave to act their way through Hulk Hogan's alcohol breath.
I'd love to talk to Mila Kunis about what it was like to work on this movie.
Oh, she's become an awful human being.
Like, she defended that rapist, and then also is, like, a Zionist.
Like, fuck her, dude.
That'd be the funniest thing to ask Mila Kunis, like, of all the things.
Oh, man.
See, this is why I'm glad I don't follow up on celebrity gossip.
I don't know who's bad, who's not.
Never meet your favorite Santa with muscles cast member.
You know, I mean, I'm pretty sure my favorite is Don Stark, who plays Lenny, but I'm guessing
he's dead.
Oh, boy.
I like...
This is Jake's approach to episodes.
Listen, guys, I'm pretty sure this is an uncredited actress.
This is her name.
Just what I think.
Also, this guy probably dead.
Not gonna look it up.
But, hey, sound off in the comments, folks.
I said he's probably...
You know what?
Fine.
That's actually perfect for the Patreon comments.
Because they can tell us something.
That's what they love doing.
Jake, don't look it up.
Let them look it up.
Yeah, that's...
Claiming someone's dead is the funniest thing you can do.
He's well alive.
He's like my parents' age.
He's totally...
He's very much alive.
He looks better now than he did in this movie, actually.
Well, we couldn't look into it.
He was misted by a truck.
Don, man, you rule in this movie.
I'm gonna track you down.
I'm gonna ask you some questions.
You can't just start talking to them, too.
Don, I've been...
You can't care not enough to look up if they're dead
and claim they're dead,
but then enough to just start talking to them on the episode.
Don, I've been going through tough times.
You and me, we should sit down and talk about your character
and how much cocaine Hulk was on during Santa with Muscles, 1996.
So when Lenny actually goes to try and rob the account,
the ATM informs him that he's gotten the wrong thumbprint,
that it's supposed to be the left thumb
and he's gotten the right thumb.
Plot foiled.
Well, first of all, that one baffled me
because, wait a minute,
why does the bank have both thumbs
but only make one thumb valid?
And if the point of the thumbprint is to validate the person,
well, you then, technically,
if you have the thumbprint,
if that's supposed to be passing,
you've all successfully done that.
That bit never didn't make sense to me.
Oh, so the movie was good except for this.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That one didn't make sense.
Everything else,
the electric lady,
the crystal caves,
everything else made sense.
The amnesia,
that was all fine.
This bit tripped me up.
Wait, I want to hear more about why you like this movie, Travis.
Wait, we'll get to that at the end.
We'll get to that at the end.
We're going to get everybody's take.
But also, another thing,
when you trade in an old system or whatever at GameStop,
you do have to put your thumbprint down,
but it's always the right thumb.
I've never done a left thumb anywhere,
so I feel like if the right thumb is categorically
the thumb that is used for the scan.
So, I don't know.
Okay, this is going to be a Travis episode
of why GameStop was actually a CIA front
to gather thumbprints.
Are you kidding me?
They asked you for your thumbprint?
Yeah, they ask you.
Yeah, they give you.
Yeah, you have to.
There's a little scanner
when you turn in your shit.
You know, GameStop has your thumbprint.
The things that corporations could do to Jake.
It's just like,
they could have sold off his organs at this point.
What do I care?
They got my thumbprint.
Who gives a shit?
Yeah, I don't know why,
but GameStop makes you get into a bathtub
and they remove your kidneys.
23andMe and got like a blood sample,
hair sample, all that,
and it told me that I was Jewish.
It was a great trade-off.
Wait, is that real, Liv?
23andMe, it told you you were one of us?
No, she's imitating you, sir.
Oh, damn.
Damn, made fun of on my own episode.
It never happens.
This is the first time.
So after being rejected by the ATM,
Lenny is kidnapped by Frost's goons
who are, they drive around in an ice cream truck, I guess.
And Frost, speaking through a TV
held by one of his henchmen,
which he does a lot,
tells Lenny to sabotage Santa
so that he can nab the orphanage.
Now, this scene I thought was like kind of interesting
because you have these goons who are holding Lenny
and then there's another goon who's holding a TV.
There's a scene in which he pushes the TV closer
and further away,
like in rhythm with what the guy is saying.
It's actually, I think,
like a kind of like sliver of brilliance.
It's almost like a Terry Gilliam sort of like bit, you know?
It's a good visual bit, I will say.
We're back at the orphanage
and we get probably one of the funniest moments in the movie.
Hulk has this very sweet scene
with the littlest orphan in the church.
Her singing in this is,
it's horrifying to be honest.
And I'm pretty sure that the producers knew this
and kept it in as an inside joke.
It's just amazing that you can like love this movie
and then become critical over a little girl's singing.
This is where your critical mind activates.
She sings like shit.
Well, I mean.
I think one of your like inner family like members
is like a catty gay guy.
Maybe.
Let me see.
To the top.
The fourth down.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Liv is navigating Jake's computer faster.
She's like,
just get to the fucking,
get to the fucking clips.
I can't,
I can't get through this episode soon enough.
All right.
I'm not leaving.
What?
They still need me here.
I'm dead.
Mine for all of time.
Angel baby.
You're so fine.
Angel baby.
Mine for all of time.
Angel baby.
I remember that song.
I know it's not the kind of song
I'm supposed to sing here,
but I think my mom sang it to me.
If I sing it just right,
I might be able to wake up
the fairies in the window.
Fairies?
Leslie says the church has magic windows.
People used to come from all over
to see them work.
Nobody comes anymore, though.
I used to think that when they lit up,
it meant my mom was a snake.
Does Santa have a mommy and daddy?
I must,
but I don't remember.
I don't remember my parents either.
Wow.
It's like they put kids in the movie
just to make Hulk look smarter,
but he still is the dumbest guy
in every scene.
I remember that song.
I didn't think about that.
So here we get a little background
on Hulk's character,
which will be revealed later on.
There's kind of like a big reveal
like in the third act.
Yeah.
And after this,
Hulk asked the little girl
if they can sing the song again,
and this just had me howling with laughter
when I watched it the first time.
Let's try that song again.
Do you know it?
Start me off.
I'll always remember
the time I spent with you.
November, December, April, May, and June.
You are my angel baby.
You're so fine.
Angel baby.
Mind for all time.
All time.
Right here.
Here we go.
Wow.
Wow.
Okay.
First of all,
I'll try.
You're my angel baby.
You're so fine.
This is a fucking song
about like a young girl.
It's literally like a pedo song.
It's insane.
And Hulk doesn't even remember the words.
He's like,
it's like,
it was insane.
You can see his leg
restlessly tapping up a noun
because he's so coked up.
Yeah.
I wonder if they like
had to have a kid actor
who was worse at singing
than Hulk Hogan.
Like he refused
to be stood up
by the child singer.
Get Mila Kunis out of here.
Give me the blonde girl.
Yeah.
Give me the littlest one.
Now,
this is like when we would go to a synagogue
during high holidays
and I would like look over at my dad
during the prayers
and he'd be like,
ha,
ha,
ha,
ha,
oh no.
Like just there,
like not quite,
not quite there,
hitting a couple words
every now and again.
All these children
went on to have careers
because they signed a Faustian pact
with like Jordan Belfort.
Yeah,
and like Peter Thiel probably.
Yeah,
they,
they,
they had,
I would,
well,
let's not go there,
but.
So everybody's enjoying
their time at the orphanage
until the evil corporate goons
show up.
They have one of my favorite goons
ever,
the doctor who Julian hates,
who uses,
who uses a stethoscope
like they're nunchucks
and he diagnoses the injury
he's about to give you.
In my notes,
in all caps,
I wrote great henchmen.
I just,
genuinely,
this was one of the most annoying
parts of the movie
was dealing with like
Frost's little minions
like and all the like fights,
they just,
nothing lands.
So during the melee,
Taylor,
one of the orphans
played by Adam Wiley,
goes missing.
Hulk and Lenny track him
all the way to Frost Mansion
where he's about to shoot
through the window
with a slingshot.
He's had enough.
They stop him just in time
through the window
and Hulk sees Frost's villain bulletin board
with a circle around the orphanage.
So we find out here
that Frost has bought up
every single property in the town
and the last sort of holdout
is this orphanage.
Hulk goes back to the mission
and he asks the kids,
you know,
what's so special about the building?
And they tell him that there's
an old catacombs beneath them
and even an old vault.
When they get down there,
you can see that there are initials
carved into the vault door,
including ones identical
to Hulk's character,
Blake Thorne.
Hmm.
This is really like watching
a toddler jam a rectangle
into like a triangle hole.
It's like,
oh man,
really?
You're going to tie it together
in this way?
It's just so illogical.
You have to stretch
in every direction.
It even doesn't make sense later.
They're like,
yeah, Hulk,
you grew up with like
your rich parents
in the mansion on the hill.
And it's like,
so why was he in a fucking orphanage?
Was he fucking adopted
by rich parents?
Where are they?
What's going on here?
Yeah, agreed, agreed, agreed.
I think it's kind of like
a Potter situation
where he was an orphan
but left a lot of money.
But if that's the case,
where's the, you know,
where's the nanny?
Where's, you know,
where's the Bruce Wayne scenario?
It's a mess.
And the idea is that
Thorne essentially was
raised in the same orphanage
which we'll find out later
but like had a rough scrabble life.
He had to really work
his way to the top.
So again,
he's, you know,
this kind of like
American dream
but with the effort
whereas Hulk is like
the toy wielding
like guy
who just got handed it all.
And it shows that,
yeah,
if you pull yourself up
by your bootstraps
you're actually way more evil.
Yeah, new money.
New money has to do worse shit
whereas old money
it's like perfectly moral.
The victory of Reagan
over fucking like
the Bush generation
neocon ideals.
Also, inexplicably,
there are like
some kind of good tracking shots
in this section
where they follow the kids
and Hulk
as they kind of go down
into the catacombs
for the first time
and it's actually
kind of dynamically shot.
I was like,
what is going on?
Like it kind of had
a Ghostbusters vibe to me.
I was like,
what the fuck?
I had one of the worst
experiences ever
because I watched
most of this movie
and then I went to
a screening of
Jean Cocteau's Orpheus
which was so beautiful.
Like just so good
and done with so
little resources
at a time where
they had to work
under such constraints
and then I had to
come back to this
and watch the rest of it
and I was like,
holy hell.
It's like having
a Wagyu patty
between two pieces of shit.
Man, that's tough.
See, I did it the right way.
I ripped the movie
from YouTube
in 340p.
Then I imported it
into Premiere.
Then I imported it
into Premiere
because I like to watch
the movie for the first time
and clip it
to save myself time
because oftentimes
I won't remember
the good places to clip
and so I just watched it
in little pieces
on a tiny little screen
in my editing window
and guess what?
Loved it.
Oh my god.
So the kids have worked out
the first three numbers
to the vault combo
but they don't know
the last number.
Hulk doesn't know
how he knows it
but he somehow
finds the last combination number
and the vault clicks open.
Oh, oh, I remember this one.
He's like,
88.
Wait a minute.
42, 36, 25.
Hold on.
88, 88, 88.
And inside I wrote,
it's a fucking diamond mine
but it's not that.
It's like an energy crystals
that provide
an endless supply
of electricity.
Yes, this is for babies again.
It is genuinely like,
it has the,
yeah, it has that kind of logic
of like duck tails
or ninja turtles.
Yeah, totally, totally.
I also think that there might be
a dildo joke here
because one of the kids
picks up a very phallic
looking crystal
and the headmaster is like,
don't touch that,
you don't know where it's been.
Did you guys pick up on that?
Jesus, yes.
There's a bunch of stuff
like this in the movie.
It's, in fact, I...
In the children's movie.
Yeah.
Oh, it's bad.
We'll talk about it in a bit
but this is somehow
like a children's movie
that has an actual reference
to Desert Storm.
Yeah, also some gruesome deaths
coming up.
We'll talk about those.
We're almost,
listener, if you're having
a tough time,
we're almost there.
Don't, don't, don't.
Come on.
Don't, yeah, again,
you can't apologize
for doing what you do.
Come on, let's cut this
but like always assume
that the listener
is having a fantastic time
with us.
Yeah, come on, Jake.
You know how to perform.
Show us your tits
and fucking show us your tits.
I get made fun of too much
and then I start
to lose confidence.
After exploring
the crystal mine,
Hulk comes out
and he's talking to Lenny.
He's like,
you know,
why did I know
the combination of the safe?
How do I know that?
He's like,
I know I'm not
the real Santa Claus
which is kind of like
the only sort of human moment
in the entire movie
where he's like,
look, I'm not a fucking idiot.
I know I'm not
really Santa Claus.
This was actually
not scripted.
It's Hulk Hogan realizing
in real life
that he's not Santa Claus.
Lenny tells him,
he goes,
the kids need Santa Claus
right now.
And by the way,
Lenny still has his wallet.
He could end all of this
and be like,
dude, this is who you are.
This is where you live.
I'm sorry I took your wallet.
He does eventually
but this would have,
I was really hoping
that this would be the moment
where Lenny kind of goes,
here you go.
That would have been nice.
That's how I would have written it.
Well, Frost has him
by the balls
like over this
like debt thing.
That's true.
That's true.
Yeah, but he only,
they only reconcile
when it's clear
he can't take advantage
of him anymore.
When it's like the jig is up
then it's like,
sorry.
Yeah, sorry.
Always ask for forgiveness
instead of for permission.
So speaking of,
they use Lenny
as like an inside man,
the evil guys,
to sort of like
set up an ambush
at the orphanage
and the main doctor henchman,
the one who's like
got the stethoscope nunchucks,
breaks in
and he and Hulk engage
in like their third fist fight
of the movie.
This time it's in
the mission bell tower.
Hulk knocks him out
with ease
but unfortunately
there's an animatronic Santa
on the roof
that kind of gently pushes
Hulk Hogan off.
Insane.
And he lands in a garbage truck
hitting his head.
A guy who can stop
an ice cream truck
by just holding a rope
attached to it
is getting pushed
off of a high balcony
by a fucking animatronic Santa.
Yeah, it's very gentle too
and he's kind of like
it happens kind of slowly
and he's like
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Yeah.
So he lands in a garbage truck.
He hits his head
and he regains his memory.
He wakes up in his own mansion
thinking that it was all a dream
but he's still in the Santa suit.
It was all real.
He tries to call the orphanage
but Frost Goons
intercept the call
using a wild looking
telephone tapping device
way out of place.
in this movie.
Like what were they thinking?
It's like a giant phone
and they're holding up wires
to like a telephone pole.
It's like a whole thing.
Dude, one of the villains
literally like the whole thing
is that he uses methane gas.
The joke is that he's like
some sort of fart.
He's like a fart monster.
Fart chemist.
And they use it at the end
to be like
he is so stinky.
So basically...
A movie for donkeys.
A movie for babies.
So they like tap the phone
and I guess they play like an AI...
What nowadays would be an AI voice
of the orphanage headmaster
basically telling Hulk
to like fuck off.
Like we don't want anything
to do with you.
I don't know how they get her voice.
If it's somebody who sounds like her.
Whatever.
He recorded her reacting to him.
Like it's the scientist
when he enters the room
at one point
the female character
that heads the orphanage
says those exact words
and then they use it later.
Oh my God.
I can't believe you just
you just explained
the like the correct logic
of this movie.
Like that there's actually
a reason for this
that you somehow caught
and I didn't.
Amazing.
So basically Hulk is like
oh they don't like me.
I don't know what to do.
For some reason
so Santa is gone.
He's back at his mansion
but for some reason
Lenny the Gambler
is still living in the orphanage
eating the children's food
which I thought was really funny.
Yes.
We see him slumped
in the kitchen
after making himself
a giant ham sandwich
but he's too guilty to eat it.
He sold Santa out.
Dr. Frost finally shows up
at the orphanage
with his whole goon squad
and Dr. Frost is like
a germaphobe I guess
and he's got a full
hazmat suit on
and they like march
the kids down
into the vault
they make them open up
the door
and then he basically
says that he's going
to put them to work
in the mines.
He's going to make them
into little miners
but before this
there's a scene
where they're like
spraying cans
of unidentified stuff
that makes everyone cough
and they're all wearing masks
and this leads to nothing.
There's no explanation
of what that is.
Was it meant to make them cough?
Fall asleep?
No idea.
He mentions the gas earlier, right?
He tries to gas that guy
who's upside down.
I can't remember what
he said it was.
I think it's fart gas.
It's methane gas.
It's methane, yeah.
He says it's like
disinfected.
It's essentially fart gas
and that's it.
The kids are like
oh no, we're smelling farts.
This is awful.
Drowning in farts.
We're being pumped.
This room is being pumped
full of farts.
I guess we'll have to
follow him down in the mine.
Farts were one of the
funnier things in 1996.
But there's no farting.
That makes sense.
It's just the idea
of methane gas.
That doesn't work.
The audience has to
imagine the smell.
Just like you have to
imagine this movie is good.
What do you want with us?
With you, nothing.
I want what's in your vault,
what's under this
whole neighborhood.
You just happen to be
in the way.
Then let us go.
Who's going to do
my mining?
Why, you son of a...
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
There are children present.
Children.
Hello, children.
I'd like you to do a favor
for your Uncle Ebner.
I'd like you to open
that vault.
We can't.
We don't know anything.
We're just kids.
You help out
your Uncle Ebner
and I'll give you
some Christmas cookies,
candy canes,
and plum pudding.
Plum pudding?
I tried.
Prepare them for mining.
No!
Lenny!
Oh!
By the way, Lenny,
I want to thank you
for letting us in.
I'm sure it was quite
a sacrifice for you.
Lenny!
I can't believe you!
Take them away!
Oh my God!
You're a Benedict Arnold!
I can't believe you,
traitor!
One of the kids
calls him Benedict Arnold.
Yeah.
Incredible.
I love the sound effect
as they plop the mining
hats on.
It's like...
This is something
they do a lot
in the movie
is just put in
straight up Looney Tunes
sounds for actions.
I like it.
It sets the tone.
Especially,
I mean,
this is like the...
For who, Travis?
For the film itself.
For the audience
to understand
how to approach it.
So the...
But also, yeah,
I just love the idea
of like using orphans
for forced mining labor.
This is just as cartoonishly evil
as it gets.
Yeah.
Incredible.
So Hulk is back at the mansion.
He's super sad,
bored,
eating healthy gruel and fruit
and drinking water
instead of Christmas cookies,
jerk chicken,
and milk.
He doesn't even want
to beat up his staff anymore.
Ash!
Ash!
Ash!
Ash!
Thanks, Pierre.
Mon Dieu,
I've never seen
a bus like this.
He loves to hit me.
Incredible.
Incredible.
French chef.
Mon Dieu,
Mon Dieu,
he loves to beat me senseless.
I tried to do a good job.
Lenny can't take
the guilt anymore.
He calls Hulk
from the orphanage
and lets him know
they're in trouble.
Hulk rallies his waitstaff
and they pile into the Hummer,
again blowing by the cops
and causing a chase.
At one point during the chase,
Hulk's boys decide
to dump some of his
branded protein powder
on the pursuing cop car
with a flustered
Clint Howard inside
and we get this
absolute banger
of a line.
How about some
Blake's Whey protein powder
for our little friends?
I was a desert storm,
you know.
I'm bad.
I'm a heartbreaker.
I'm a troublemaker.
I just,
I was in desert storm,
you know.
I'm bad.
I'm a heartbreaker.
I'm a troublemaker.
A hundred percent
just cocaine.
Like,
who is writing this shit?
This is,
um...
Yeah,
I broke the heart
of a lot of Iraqi women.
It's amazing.
It's amazing.
Where does that line come?
Yeah,
where...
And they're like,
oh,
the cops are pursuing him.
They'll dump the protein powder
to get,
you know,
to make him spin out.
It really is like
a Ninja Turtles cartoon.
I do think this movie
is essentially like
a visual
and auditory
and just vibe
representation
of desert storm
like war syndrome.
Like,
coming home
and just being
utterly confused
in a suburban environment
and everything's too bright
and you're like,
fuck,
should I like,
I don't know,
shoot people with paintballs?
I don't,
I don't,
I don't remember who I am.
If red like that,
if red is like
the fever dream
of a war vet
coming back to an America
in the flush
of like the Clinton years
like financial boom,
I think this,
this actually does make sense.
Yeah,
it's perfect.
It's like the,
the beginning
of the Fourth Reich
sort of,
you know,
this like disgruntled war vet
coming back,
you know,
World War I,
desert storm.
Yes.
You think that you're
incredibly powerful,
you can't comprehend,
it's like your baby strength,
you know,
everything will be fine
and then obviously
it does not turn out fine.
It's like we see the,
the kind of delusional optimism.
Yeah,
this is like an accurate
90s first blood.
Well,
and one of the cops
like pulls out a bazooka
at this point,
so further illustrating
your point.
Yeah,
there's like very serious weaponry
but it's like,
ho ho ho,
like very funny.
Things start to get like
very violent here.
To break into the orphanage,
they hook up the,
like Hulk's Hummer battery
to the doorknob
in like a Home Alone style
booby trap
that electrocutes,
you know,
the first line of henchmen.
We gotta,
and we gotta talk about
this scene where,
where he puts the gas tube
back into the,
you know,
the fart goon's hazmat suit
and they blow him up
like a balloon
while the kids laugh at him.
It's kind of graphic,
like he's duct taping his neck
so that he can't take
the helmet off.
Yeah,
a little prelude,
a little preview
of Abu Ghraib here.
Well,
and then Lenny
like dumps a bucket of water
on the woman
with the electricity gloves
and her death,
or you know,
it's like pretty gruesome,
like there's lots of electricity,
she looks like she's in real pain,
she kind of flies off,
like the movie takes
a wild turn here
in this final sort of
like conflict scene.
Yeah,
her line is,
you wouldn't hit a woman,
would you?
And like Hulk doesn't say anything,
he's advancing on her
and then Lenny in the rafters
is like,
but I would
and dumps the water on her.
It's like,
okay,
what the fuck?
And then I wrote,
aww,
and then Lenny gives him
the wallet back
with only a couple bucks missing.
Sweet moment.
But there's a no homo moment here too
where he's like,
you're not going to hug me,
are you?
And Hulk just looks at him
kind of uncomfortable
and then they walk off together.
Of course,
of course.
So,
while Hulk is stomping
through the orphanage
looking for the bad guys,
he happens upon the headmaster
and groundskeeper Clayton
holed up in one of the church rooms.
Finally,
Clayton tells Hulk
that he grew up
at the orphanage.
His last name isn't Thorn,
it's something
very Polish sounding.
And the reveal
that Frost
was his best friend
at the orphanage.
Fantastic.
Well,
all you had to do
was knock.
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
I am now.
I'm Blake Thorn.
Good to meet you.
Let's go.
I've got to find the children.
Uh,
Blake,
Blake,
I'd like to talk to you a minute.
Have a seat.
Yeah.
Have a seat.
Hey,
you lied to her.
Blake,
Blake Thorn.
What's the man?
Blake Tarachevsky.
Doesn't fit on the bottle.
How did you?
Isn't it coming back
to you yet, son?
You grew up here.
Look.
Is that me?
There's more.
You see the boy
sitting right next to you?
He was your best friend.
Ebner Frost.
So,
Blake Thorn,
fake name.
Ebner Frost,
real name.
Of course.
Real name.
He also,
he also remembers
that he's using a fake name,
but doesn't remember
that he was in the orphanage
and he's talking to someone
he's known his whole life.
Blake Thorachesky.
Oh,
Blake,
uh,
Polsky.
Polska Gromi.
Just,
just great.
This movie understands
so many different things,
but race is definitely
one of them.
Yeah,
race is definitely
one of them.
It probably,
it understands that the most.
God,
at this point,
I was so fucking
mentally checked out.
I was like,
just please,
like,
if there was like a 1.5x,
like,
version,
like,
I would have lived
right out on this.
Uh,
meanwhile,
I was getting like,
way into the movie.
I,
here are my notes.
I wrote,
crystal sword fight
is fucking amazing
at the end,
where Frost and Hulk Hogan
go down into the crystal mines
and they each pull out
a long crystal
that's like,
uh,
you know,
the size of a sword
and it's kind of like
a lightsaber battle.
The swords like spark
and kind of light up
as,
as,
as they clash.
Loved it.
And then the ending,
the orphanage exploding
with electricity,
I thought was so dope.
Very Ghostbusters,
very Poltergeist.
And my note was,
I'm legit surprised
how much I like this.
The film ends with,
now the orphans,
nobody has a home
and Hulk Hogan is like,
well,
I know someplace
that's available.
And I thought,
oh,
that's kind of nice.
He's going to bring
the kids to his home
and like the movie's
going to end
with all of them
on motorcycles
shooting paintball guns
at the waitstaff.
But no,
they just take over
Ebner Frost.
Like,
there's no reconciliation
with Frost.
Like,
hey,
we were both orphans,
man.
Like,
like,
can't you be good for once?
And like,
some kind of happy
ending,
it's like,
no,
they all,
all the goons
and Frost go to jail
and they just take his house.
They just take his house
and make it the new orphanage.
Eminent domain.
Yeah,
this is a,
this is a irreconcilable war
between old and new money.
Like,
there's no,
there's no shaking hands.
You have to destroy
his way of life.
But also,
those stories are fucked.
It's like,
ah,
the two types of rich guys
in America
are both just fucked up orphans.
Yeah.
Like,
what?
One of them,
one of them had rich parents
that left him a ton of money
and so he was raised
on the silver spoon
and then the other orphan,
like,
had to cheat,
steal,
lie,
and kill
to become rich
and,
but he's a bad guy now.
Inexplicable.
Jordan Belfort,
what were you thinking,
man?
You made one of Jake's
favorite movies.
I'm eternally grateful.
And apparently,
Travis liked it,
so please,
Travis,
can you explain to me
how,
I mean,
just,
I'm just trying to understand
how you look at that
crystal cave
and see,
like,
a beautiful,
cool set.
I mean,
I guess I imagined
watching it as a kid,
you know?
Okay.
Just like,
just like,
you know,
little things,
like,
you know,
the car chases.
Like the scene
near the end
where the car
rolls up
and it's all smashed
and blackened
and that was pretty funny.
And,
yeah,
yeah,
the weird
electric hands lady,
that was,
that was,
that was odd.
Yeah,
and sometimes there was,
yeah,
there was cool fight scenes,
some,
some great taekwondo kicks,
you know?
Yeah.
It was,
it's like in that sense,
like where you don't really understand
what's going on.
It's just a disconnected scene,
one disconnected scene
after the other.
It's,
it's pretty fun.
I hate to do this,
but like,
if one were to make you,
you know,
blow into a,
one of those devices,
what would your BAC be
at the end of,
like,
watching this?
Were you,
Oh,
no,
I was perfectly sober.
Were you lit?
Sober watching this,
yeah.
You were dead sober
and you watched this?
Yeah.
That's good.
I feel like your inner child is alive
and like,
that gives me some hope
that maybe you don't have pure rationality
at your heart.
That's me too.
I mean,
I definitely,
I think I approach this
as what if I had watched this
when I was,
let's see,
yeah,
about 13,
13,
12 years old.
And I would have loved it.
I would have loved the action scenes.
I would have loved the electricity.
There were some effects in there.
To me,
you know,
as a young,
as a young movie enjoyer's brain,
everything would have been tied up nicely.
Oh,
when they went to the same orphanage
and,
oh,
well,
there's crystals beneath the thing,
kind of Goonie.
You know,
there's a little bit of Goonies in there,
a little bit of Ghostbusters,
a little bit of Home Alone.
Um,
the,
I,
yeah,
I'm with Travis.
That's,
that's kind of,
I think,
was necessary for me to enjoy it as well,
was to watch it from the perspective of my younger self,
which I find,
you know,
as the present day gets increasingly more horrifying,
I am finding more joy in kind of trying to mentally time travel back to those days.
So it makes perfect sense that,
uh,
this,
this,
this movie,
uh,
this,
this movie,
this movie ended up being a net positive on my life.
I don't,
I don't know why you have to imagine yourself as a child.
One of us is a child and watch the movie.
Liv,
what do you,
what do you think?
Um,
I feel like if I would have watched this as a 13 year old,
I wouldn't have liked it.
I don't think so.
I would have thought it was done.
Yeah,
but you also,
you also have like zero nineties nostalgia.
No.
Cause you like basically weren't really around.
No,
this isn't my era,
I guess,
in all fairness.
I,
I was never a movie person as a kid.
This press is like a couple of things and like,
okay.
I also took a note that like at the end,
when they convert the,
the mansion into the new orphanage,
the place is like Neverland.
Like it's,
it's Neverland ranch.
Like it's like a Michael Jackson,
like we're all having fun and playing games all day.
And we have RC cars and blow,
we're blowing bubbles and there's pony rides and stuff.
Very much like an innocence of the nineties perspective on Michael Jackson's like,
you know,
dream for what kids would want in like an orphanage.
Somehow this aged very poorly.
I don't,
yeah,
we know how that turned out.
There were a lot of movies in this era that were about kids,
like kind of lucking into insane amounts of wealth and what they would do with it.
I can think of two off the top of my head.
There was Richie Rich and there was blank check.
Both movies showed kids.
I mean,
I believe in,
it was Richie Rich where he has a fucking McDonald's in his basement.
He has a,
like you could go down to the basement.
Maybe it's in blank check.
It's in one of the two,
but he's got a full with like people working there.
Like you'd go to the counter,
you can get a cheeseburger.
You could order right there.
Um,
this was the beginning of the end,
man,
the babification of,
of America.
It was when we all decided to retreat into our toys.
And it's,
it's a time that I think for you was a golden era because it was the era of just like,
don't worry about it.
Mm-hmm.
We're the good guys.
Yeah.
You know,
it was really easy to invade Iraq.
That went really smoothly.
Yeah.
A couple of people are back,
back here and they still think they're over there and they're trying to raid a suburban house.
Uh,
you know,
but you're going to be fine.
Like,
look at all these cool toys.
Look at all these cool cartoons.
Look at all this candy.
Like,
aren't you having fun?
We,
we didn't have any of that though.
There wasn't this,
there wasn't like any,
in the nineties,
there wasn't any kind of cultural awareness of any kind.
Like the news was something that was on once a night.
My parents watched it.
It was local news.
It was boring.
Uh,
I was waiting for the Simpsons to come on and they enjoyed the economy.
Yeah.
We liked,
we liked Bill,
Bill Clinton was,
he played the saxophone.
Um,
he like wore sunglasses.
He was on the,
he was featured on the Simpsons.
And we all know how that turned out.
He was a fucking pedophile.
Yeah.
Every part of the nineties was a horrifying lie,
barely holding together the fabric.
Of,
of what is,
what was already like a,
a,
a purely demonic global power had been installed.
It's empire.
Yeah.
Which makes perfect,
which makes perfect sense because the moment they gave us the internet and
everybody had infinite more access,
uh,
and,
and awareness,
everything began to crumble and people started to,
you know,
uh,
deteriorate.
Just,
just the culture started to completely deteriorate and split off and
factions and different.
So it makes perfect sense.
And it's,
it's really weird to think of,
of this era as kind of the last,
the last time when things were good.
Cause they weren't,
they were horrible.
Like,
but that's the thing is they weren't good.
When you look back at the media,
the media is very poorly put together and like only works because the
vibes encouraged all of it.
Like from every angle you take away the vibes and you get live's perspective,
which is like,
what the fuck am I watching?
I don't know what's going on.
I didn't remember nine 11.
She was,
I don't remember.
Yeah.
She doesn't remember nine 11.
Like it makes sense.
Like the modern mind,
like would have no patience for this.
Cause it's like,
what are we doing here?
This is insane.
Anyways,
that's why I have the heart of a child.
Like,
but in like,
uh,
I'm a zoomer and that's why it's okay for me to date zoomers.
I do not date zoomers.
That was a joke.
Well,
no,
no,
don't edit on that.
No.
Okay.
Okay.
Wait,
wait,
wait,
wait,
we can,
we can come up with something.
Well,
listener,
I hope you enjoyed this delicious movie night episode.
It's like a,
it's like going to the movie theater,
uh,
ask,
asking your wife if you can get the butter topping.
She says,
yes,
you put as much of that shit on as possible.
You're shaking the,
you're shaking the bucket.
You're making sure it gets all the way down to the bottom.
And then halfway through the movie,
when you've eaten half the bucket,
you've got a headache.
That's what this episode feels like.
This is like the feeling you get when you're halfway through an enormous packet of Oreos.
You're like still enjoying it.
You're not quite feeling ill yet,
but things are not going well.
Yeah.
I can't believe this movie existed.
I don't even know how I ended up finding it.
I think I,
I think I Googled like weirdest,
worst,
like Christmas movies of all time or something.
And this was pretty high up on the list.
So.
Yeah.
Uh,
what do,
what do we got rating wise,
Travis?
How many Christmas,
uh,
farts or,
uh,
muscles or out of 10?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I,
I give it,
I give it a good,
uh,
16,
um,
protein powder farts out of 10.
Jesus Christ.
This man doesn't even understand the scale.
I'm,
I'm going like,
I'm going like 7.75,
like eight,
which means that from earlier in the episode,
it went up by 0.75.
Well,
I mean,
you gotta,
you gotta factor into the rating,
how much it annoyed Julian and Liz.
So that gives it an extra like 0.25 or so.
That's,
this is a huge W for you right before Christmas.
Right as I'm about to go on vacation too.
I'm like,
see you suckers.
And Julian,
you gotta listen to the whole thing over again.
You piece of shit.
Fuck.
I do.
I have to edit this one.
Liv,
what's your rating?
I give it a three PTSD Iraq war veterans out of 10.
You know what?
I give it nine out of 11.
America deserved it for this.
Yeah.
