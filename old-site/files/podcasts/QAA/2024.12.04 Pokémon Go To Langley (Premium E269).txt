Welcome to the QAA Podcast Premium Episode 269.
Pokemon Go to Langley.
As always, we are your hosts, Jake Rokotansky,
Liv Aker,
Julian Fields,
and Travis View.
Remember the summer of 2016?
American gymnast Simone Biles made her Olympic debut in Rio de Janeiro,
dazzling the world with her generational talent.
The Netflix series Stranger Things made captivating television
by combining horror, mystery, conspiracy theories, and 80s nostalgia.
And the two major political parties hosted their national conventions,
the Republican one showcasing a party bitterly divided over the nomination of Donald Trump,
who was surely headed to a spectacular defeat in November.
And on top of all that, a new gaming craze swept the nation and the world.
Millions were engrossed with the innovative augmented reality game, Pokemon Go.
Rather than being a game that is played on a user's phone,
it's a game played in the real world through the phone.
By using the smartphone's camera and GPS,
users traveled through the physical world to track down and capture Pokemon.
Getting the Pokemon means pointing the phone's camera in physical space,
seeing a digital Pokemon superimposed on the screen and tapping it to throw a Pokeball.
Finding better Pokemon requires users to leave their house and explore landmarks and parks where they typically spawn.
Getting Pokeballs or potions means finding PokeStops at landmarks and public buildings.
It was a smash hit and possibly proof that our smartphone addiction
could be perfectly compatible with going outside, getting exercise, and socializing.
I did play some of that game at the beginning.
I was very fond of that.
That was the summer before I went to university.
I just went around Vancouver catching Pokemon.
It was great.
So you were like 12 as a precocious graduate?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I played it with my daughter.
And I remember what I really liked about it is I drove down to Balboa Park in San Diego.
I don't know if you've ever driven an adolescent girl somewhere she wasn't really excited to go.
But they kind of go mentally limp.
They're not really excited to go there.
But then you give them Pokemon Go and they say, go find Pokemon.
All of a sudden, they're in charge.
I'm following her, figuring out where she wants to go.
And they're a lot more engaged in the environment.
And yeah, it was a lot of fun.
Happy memories, which have been tainted by the strangeness around the game.
I actually never played Pokemon Go.
It's weird.
Whoa, that is kind of weird.
I just think video games belong in the video game world, not in my real world.
The part that Jake didn't like was he had to leave his house.
Well, I just didn't like it.
I don't like digital characters superimposed over photorealistic real video capture.
I don't know.
It's just not my thing.
It's like two worlds that shouldn't fly.
They should be separate.
What Jake is not telling you is that he captured a lot of low-level Pokemon directly in front of his toilet.
And then he was done.
Now, for a children's game about collecting fighting monsters, Pokemon Go sure has inspired a lot of paranoia over the past eight years.
Privacy advocates expressed concern because playing the game requires allowing the developer to have extensive access to your mobile phone, including the camera, storage, GPS, Bluetooth, contacts, and pretty much everything else.
What's more, governments around the world became concerned that the game is a front for a massive crowdsourced intelligence gathering system.
And just last month, the company that developed Pokemon Go, Niantic, announced that they have, in fact, used location-based player data to build an artificial intelligence geospatial model.
This is another huge W for China.
They were like, nah.
Nope.
This is illegal.
Now, the whole thing opens up questions about how much privacy we have to give up just to play a game on our phones, what our data is being used for, and the relationship between the tech industry and the security state.
So today, we're going to explore those questions and hopefully arrive at just the right amount of paranoia.
Not too crazy, not too naive, just right.
The sweet spot.
It's not like it's going to change anything I do about the world.
It's just to not be owned, you know?
Yeah.
Well, you know, here's the thing.
I think that being owned stings less when you know it's going to happen beforehand.
Okay, I'm going to tell, you know, these massive corporations everything about my life, but I know it's happening.
So I got you, really.
It sounds like Travis was given a crash course on perception management by his handler.
He's like, let me tell you how paranoid you should be.
So, yeah, I did some research into how Pokemon came to be and the concerns surrounding it.
And probably the most interesting thing I sort of put together is that Pokemon Go only exists because of 9-11.
So it's a long chain of events.
But, yeah, they're there.
I'll get to that.
What?
Yeah.
Now, the short version of the story of Pokemon Go is that back in 2001, entrepreneur John Hankey founded a company called Keyhole, which made interactive earth visualization software.
It struggled for years before it was saved from bankruptcy by its use in television news reports.
This gave it enough buzz to earn an investment from In-Q-Tel, a not-for-profit venture capital firm owned by the CIA.
And once the company was back on its feet, it was acquired by Google.
So and then John Hankey developed Google products like Google Maps.
And then within Google, he founded the company Niantic, which went on to eventually create Pokemon Go.
Now, you know, it sounds a little strange and spooky that the CIA is sort of like venture capital firm would be interested in this early company.
But I should point out that this is this is not unusual that that there's some sort of relationship between defense and Intel and tech companies.
So Google's relationship to defense and Intel goes back to its very conception.
The search technology that would eventually be used by Google was developed in the 90s by founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page when they were a Ph.D.
computer science students at Stanford.
So this research was partially funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or DARPA.
I don't like any of this.
I don't like DARPA and funding and companies nonprofit owned by the CIA.
It just feels a little dark.
This is such a conspiracy W because, you know, like this feels like a post you would find on r slash conspiracy in 2017.
And we're like, you know, Niantic was bought by the CIA.
And it's like, OK, dude, sure.
And just remember, these are the ones we are finding out about.
Yeah, yeah.
This research for the technology that made Google.
Yeah, it was funded by DARPA.
This is the branch of the Pentagon develops new technology.
And I do want to point out, like the DARPA involvement was never hidden.
In fact, in the foundational 1998 paper by Sergey Brin and Larry Page that was titled The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine.
And in that paper, they tip their hat in the acknowledgment section, which says this.
Funding for this cooperative agreement is also provided by DARPA and NASA.
So, yeah.
Does this soothe you, Travis?
Does this soothe you?
Well, no.
I mean.
Oh, they're not hiding it.
Oh, that's good.
Hey, there's a visible part of an iceberg.
I bet there's nothing underneath.
Google, like many large tech companies, is also a government contractor.
The relationship between Google and the NSA goes back to at least August of 2003 when the company entered into a $2.07 million contract with the agency.
According to documents acquired through the Freedom of Information Act by the nonprofit organization Consumer Watchdog, the NSA paid Google for a search application capable of searching 15 million documents in four languages.
John Hanke, founder of Niantic, actually had some experience working for the government in his youth.
After graduating as an arts and science major from the University of Texas at Austin in 1989, he took a job in the U.S. Foreign Service in Washington, D.C.
And then in the U.S. Embassy in Myanmar.
Now, as far as I can tell, he's never really detailed the work that he did.
In an interview with Wired, he said that it was, quote, just foreign affairs stuff.
And in an interview with the Financial Times, he said, quote, I was third secretary and doing a bit of everything as one does.
A bit of everything.
As one does.
Nothing to see here, folks.
So Hanke actually started his career as a tech entrepreneur in gaming.
Early in his career, he founded Archetype Interactive, where he helped develop a game called Meridian 59.
This was one of the first commercial MMORPGs.
But he really found this calling in 1999, when he was shown a new graphics technology being developed by a startup gaming company called Intrinsic Graphics.
Now, the system could be used on a normal PC, but it displayed a globe textured with images and allowed the user to zoom in and out of cities.
The demo gave the feeling of, like, traveling through space.
Hanke thought the technology could be paired with high-resolution satellite imagery, which was just being commercially available,
to create digital representations of Earth that a user could essentially move through.
Intrinsic Graphics wanted to remain a games business, though, so John Hanke struck a deal that allowed him to use the technology for a new company called Keyhole Inc.
The name was a reference to the Keyhole spy satellites that replaced the U-2 spy plane.
It was also, according to him, a tongue-in-cheek reference to author Tom Clancy's habits,
of calling any overhead intel gathering system Keyhole.
Keyhole's main product was called EarthViewer.
And what they did is they transformed these satellite images and aerial photography into an interactive, like, video game-like experience.
It was originally marketed to businesses, which paid anywhere from $599 to thousands per year in order to access it.
A major market was, they thought, commercial real estate people.
The idea is that you could use these images, these overhead images, to measure plots of land.
But there was also a consumer version, which cost just $49 per year.
Keyhole had the misfortune of being incorporated in 2001, right when the dot-com bubble burst,
and venture capitalists became much more selective in who they gave money to.
Desperate to pay the bills, Keyhole tried a lot of strategies to make ends meet.
You know, they tried to develop into the Japanese market.
They cut their pay.
They tried to pay their employees in equity.
But in 2003, Keyhole caught a break that saved the business.
In March of that year, the United States military invaded Iraq.
The San Jose Mercury News put it this way.
It wasn't long after the bombs began erupting in Iraq that all heck broke loose at a two-year-old Silicon Valley startup called Keyhole.
As they say, war is heck.
What changed is that the war allowed Keyhole to secure a long-negotiated deal with CNN.
Specifically, CNN reporter Miles O'Brien used the technology to zoom into areas of interest in Iraq,
while at the same time giving a shout-out to the company,
while the URL earthviewer.com displayed at the top of the screen.
Walk us through the strategy of Basra as we take a look at some satellite imagery from our friends at Keyhole Graphics Digital Globe.
First of all, I want to highlight what we're talking about here.
As you know, of course, U.S. forces are staged all along that border there.
And right in this spot right here is Basra.
Now, as we move in a little bit closer, let's talk about, well, let's give people the lay of the land, shall we?
At the time, this stuff was mind-blowing.
It had, like, this 3D map of Earth that allowed you into, like, real-time just, like, zoom in to any part of it.
It was like flying on the computer.
According to the book Never Lost Again by early Keyhole employee Bill Kilday,
this caught the attention of the movers and shakers in Washington,
because they all apparently watch a lot of TV.
The entire State Department, every U.S. senator, every congressman, every ambassador,
every foreign government, every military intelligence commander,
secretary of defense, joint chiefs of staff,
the entire military industrial complex was witnessing the 24-hour non-stop infomercial
for Keyhole Earth Viewer software as demoed by Wolf Blitzer and Miles O'Brien.
And many of them were asking the same critical question.
Why the hell don't I have that on my desk?
I mean, that's just a funny thing, because you kind of imagine, like,
the joint chiefs of staff would have access to the best, I guess, graphics technology available.
But no, they're watching CNN be like, hey, get me that.
I want that.
They're like, a digital globe where I can zoom in and see exactly where I want to invade next?
Why isn't this on my desk right now?
So this added attention also increased the interest of In-Q-Tel.
Keyhole signed a deal worth $1.5 million with them, which was their largest contract to date.
You know, that book also recounts an exchange between John Hankey and the In-Q-Tel partner,
John Painter.
Who is asking?
John asked Painter.
The whole team was, of course, curious about the final destination of our Keyhole Earth system.
The team speculated that it was Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld,
Vice President Dick Cheney, or Secretary of State Colin Powell.
You know I can't tell you that, Painter replied, knowing of John's past career in the Foreign Service.
Honestly, it would be easier for me to tell you who is not asking.
Okay.
I mean, this is also a very strange situation.
An investor comes and gives you lots of money to develop your product and like to make it better
and to keep it going and ask, okay, well, who was really interested?
Who asked?
Who wanted this product?
Oh, I can't tell you that.
Not allowed.
Just you're making a product that you don't know for who?
Suddenly all the agencies were getting along.
And the CIA immediately started working with Keyhole to assist with what they call geospatial intelligence.
Again, this is not something that was secret.
A page on the CIA's website describes how they use this high-tech service.
CIA worked closely with other intelligence community organizations to tailor Keyhole's system to meet their needs.
The finished product transformed the way intelligence officers interacted with geographic information and Earth imagery.
Users could now easily combine complicated sets of data and imagery into clear, realistic visual representations.
They didn't have to move army men on flat maps anymore.
They were like, you know, they did a 3D model.
Is this actually a functionally useful or is it like a cool thing they wanted?
Like, ah, it's on the globe.
That's a good question.
Like, I guess we don't know exactly whether or not it would actually had any real benefit to what they were doing.
It might be like, oh, this is bullshit.
Like, Wolf Blitzer gets to play with this, but I don't.
I want it.
A software engineer for Keyhole, Wes Thierry, said, quote,
The agency kept Keyhole in business, a kind of lifeline.
On his blog, he described the challenges of developing software for a government agency that valued security.
Keyhole was always scrambling to please our biggest customer, the agency,
which used our cool interface to view their own top secret data.
As a software engineer, we always were prepared to quickly change direction
and help deal with whatever issues the agency may have had.
This was sometimes problematic since the computers running the program
and experiencing the issues were often in secure areas.
This meant that they were contained in rooms with no outside telephone lines
and shielded from cell phone signals.
Tech trying to resolve their issues would have to leave the secure area,
talk to one of our engineers or support people, and go back in and try something.
Wow, that sounds awful.
You can't even look at the thing while you're trying to troubleshoot it
because it's in such a secure location because they're doing such bad shit with it.
Yeah, this really inspires a lot of confidence.
Bill Kilday explained how the Iraq war really saved the company.
We spent the spring of 2003 trying to respond to the flood of demand.
As perverse as it sounds, the invasion of Iraq proved to be a turning point for Keyhole.
A huge cash injection when we needed it the most.
Though I was adamantly opposed to the invasion,
it actually helped the company I worked for financially.
As I walked John through a recent sales report during our Monday morning staff meeting,
he commented,
Well, I guess we'll be able to make payroll.
Why isn't the CIA, like, have their own developers making something like this?
The fact that they're like,
Oh, wait, these guys, these guys did something that we desperately want.
Like, why wouldn't they just make their own version?
They got to glom on to, like, somebody in the private sector.
Well, because this is the whole American gambit, right?
It's like, you can actually give financial incentive to a large amount of private corporations,
and then they are going to be essentially an R&D for your nastiest required technologies.
This is basically why the Cold War went the way of the Americans.
Yeah, it's the most terrifically American story ever.
Like, the Pokemon Go guys building a software for the CIA to help with the Iraq war invasion.
Yeah.
So, 9-11 happens.
Bush administration uses this as a pretext for invading Iraq.
The invasion of Iraq saves Keyhole.
Keyhole purchased by Google.
John Hankey at Google develops Niantic.
Niantic makes Pokemon Go.
9-11.
Pokemon Go.
Straight line.
Mm-hmm.
Amazing.
Wow.
So, yeah, the popularity of the app exploded,
and this caught the attention of Google, who purchased it,
and essentially made the products free in the form of Google Earth,
which was a lot of fun to play with.
And then John Hankey went on to develop more products for Google.
At the company, John Hankey headed up the Geo division,
which was responsible for anything involving geography.
And it should be noted that while he ran that division,
Google was responsible for one of the most massive privacy debacles ever committed by a tech company.
And that's the title for which there is some serious competition.
So this is the story of the so-called Why Spy scandal.
Why spy?
Just because, kids.
Because we can.
We're the CIA.
So the crown jewel of Google's Geo division,
you know, something that certainly changed my life,
is Google Maps for mobile devices.
So this used GPS and cell tower data
to determine the location of your mobile device while you're driving.
Allowed just real-time maps.
Like, before this, there was like, remember MapQuest?
Yeah, it sucked.
It sucked.
Yeah, yeah.
And starting in 2007,
that feature was enhanced with Google Street View,
which provided interactive panorama images of city streets.
This was made possible by Google employing drivers for fleets of cars
equipped with 360 cameras,
which over the years drove down virtually every public road on Earth.
They did employ some technology to protect people's privacy,
such as a feature that blurred images of faces or license plates or anything else that was sensitive.
But the problem became that, for some reason,
the cars also collected data from private Wi-Fi networks.
Now, here's how that scandal was described.
Using hidden internet receivers, Google Street View vehicles also collected a vast amount of data
from users of private Wi-Fi networks in homes and businesses.
Google collected MAC addresses, the unique device ID for Wi-Fi hotspots,
network SSIDs, the user-assigned network ID name,
tied to location information for private wireless networks,
and Wi-Fi payload data, which included emails, passwords, usernames, and website URLs.
So, I mean, this is fucking insane.
So, Google controlled hundreds of cars,
which drove millions of miles all over the world,
and they collected, if your Wi-Fi wasn't secure,
they collected information about, like, the accounts you use,
the emails you receive, the websites you visit,
stuff like this.
Like, so you would reasonably assume that if you're just in your home,
emailing people,
there isn't a car owned by a tech giant outside reading it,
collecting the information that you're sending.
This is how America does it.
Everyone's like,
hey, it would suck to live in a totalitarian nation.
Well, guess what, motherfucker?
They recreated it,
except it's decentralized,
and it's all, like, through private incentive.
But the result is the same,
or worse!
So, this data collection was first discovered in April of 2010 by German regulators.
In response to inquiries,
Google posted a blog post which said this,
Google does not collect or store payload data.
The German regulators weren't happy with that,
so they asked to audit one of the Street View cars.
That caused them to kind of, like, reverse course,
Google the reverse course.
So, nine days after this request was made,
Google made a new blog post saying,
okay, yeah, actually, they did collect fragments of data,
and then they tried to blame it on, like, a rogue engineer.
So, here's what that post said.
But it's now clear that we have been mistakenly collecting samples of payload data from open,
i.e. non-password-protected Wi-Fi networks,
even though we never used that data in any Google products.
However, we will typically have collected only fragments of payload data.
So, how did this happen?
Quite simply, it was a mistake.
In 2006, an engineer working on an experimental Wi-Fi project
wrote a piece of code that sampled all categories of publicly broadcast Wi-Fi data.
A year later, when our mobile team started a project to collect basic Wi-Fi network data
using Google's Street View cars,
they included that code in their software,
although the project leaders did not want and had no intention of using payload data.
Dude, we're all looking for the person responsible.
Yeah.
So, wait, so let me get this straight.
So, when those little self-driving cars were going around with the big cameras on top,
they were also pulling all of the data if you were connected to a public Wi-Fi network,
like at Starbucks, or, you know, you forgot to set up a password on your home Wi-Fi or whatever.
Like, it was just collecting data.
Yeah, and again, I want to emphasize, this Google streetcar fleet,
250 vehicles at its peak, driving all over the world, everywhere,
collecting, you know, just data from, yeah, from just the homes and businesses they pass by.
And humans are so dumb.
We're so fucking, we're so cooked,
because we look up, we look up our street,
we see the picture, we're like,
oh, the car took a picture of my car parked out front.
Dude, you know, it's like...
It's so awesome.
It's so, there's, it couldn't be more perfect.
The company that was like,
don't be evil,
was being the most evil,
and working with the government.
Of course!
Of course, you morons!
Oh, we're so different over here!
I mean, I mean...
Oh, carpet bomb us, please!
Shit!
I mean, this is like James Bond villain kind of plan.
I'm going to unleash a massive fleet of vehicles all over the world
to collect information from every home on Earth.
Man, and the way they write it,
it's like, it's this fucking,
it's straight up like Marvel movie soy talk.
It's like, so how did this happen?
Oh, I fucking wonder!
Oh, yeah, someone accidentally...
It's just a, you know,
there's a collection of strangely aligned bad apples among us,
and somehow they represent the exact needs
of the national security state.
I just want to just emphasize that
basically everything in that blog post that Julian read
was all lies,
and this was uncovered by FCC investigation.
We did an oopsie!
They didn't collect snippets of data,
they collected over 200 gigabytes of complete data
over a two-year period,
and it was not done by a rogue engineer.
Multiple people were aware of the project,
and no one stopped it,
and they did have intentions to use the data.
An internal design document for the project
said that the data was to be, quote,
analyzed offline for use in other initiatives.
I love that, like, this surveillance,
the draconian surveillance state
is using, like, company speak
in their internal, like, discussions.
Well, yeah, this is...
Guess what?
AI is just going to be a way for them
to further wash their hands.
Oh, it's not even a rogue employee now.
It's a rogue AI.
There's literally nobody to blame.
So this caused a worldwide scandal,
but, you know, I mean,
Google is there.
They have a lot of money to burn,
and they can afford an army of the best lawyers on Earth,
so really nothing came of it.
So data protection authorities in France,
South Korea, New Zealand,
the United Kingdom, Canada, and Spain
found that Google's Wi-Fi interception
violated data protection laws.
The Privacy Commissioner of Canada
determined that Google violated
Canadian data protection law
by secretly intercepting, quote,
full names, telephone numbers,
complete email addresses,
and instant messages of many Canadians.
Google, like, intercepted a cryptic message
between me and my high school friend
talking about weed.
We didn't want to actually say
what we were doing.
So there were fines,
but compared to the Google money,
it was literally nothing.
So the French Data Protection Authority
fined Google 100,000 euros
for the interception of private data.
Germany wound up fining them
close to the maximum that they could
for that law,
which was about 150,000 euros.
But again, this is like a nickel
from their couch cushions.
Nothing.
It's insane because a poor person
who overdraws their account,
relatively speaking,
is paying more than these companies do
for doing the fucking wildest crimes.
Crimes that basically,
if you look in the fucking mirror,
would show the true colors of this country.
And it's just like,
well, I guess it's time to sacrifice
0.2% of our profits this year,
and this year only.
Yeah, I mean, they probably do this shit
knowing full well
that even if the maximum penalty is applied,
that it's like a drop in the hat.
Like, these big companies are like,
so what?
If we get caught, like, whatever,
we'll fucking pay it.
It doesn't matter.
But, you know,
Google is an American company,
so one might hope
that American regulators
would, you know,
take the tech giant to task
and protect American consumers.
Who the fuck is one in this case?
Someone who's never read an article,
studied history?
Who is one?
Who is one?
This is, surely you're talking about
some sort of bacteria
or an insect.
So, yeah, so.
That is how Julian describes Democrats.
No, no, Liv.
I did not.
Don't get me in trouble.
That's what, Liv said that, okay?
So, the Federal Trade Commission
investigated the matter,
and according to a letter
from the FTC,
they stopped investigating
after Google promised
not to do anything bad
with the data they collected.
Here's what that letter said.
Google has made assurances
to the FTC
that the company
has not used
and will not use
any of the payload data
collected
in any Google product
or service,
now or in the future.
This assurance is critical
to mitigate the potential harm
to consumers
from the collection
of payload data.
Because of these commitments,
we are ending our inquiry
into this matter
at this time.
Oh, great.
Cool, yeah.
They gave us their word.
Yeah, made assurances.
Well...
Assurances were made.
If they said so.
Fuck, man.
I know.
But, you know,
Google wasn't out
of the woods quite yet.
So, the FCC
did their own investigation,
and this one
was a little more serious.
And to their credit,
they did at least
pester them.
They used some subpoena power
to uncover
that the company
was not being truthful
in its public statements.
But Google still thwarted
this investigation
by essentially
not cooperating.
It, for example,
didn't comply
with a letter
of inquiry request
to search for
relevant employee emails
because it, quote,
would be a time-consuming
and burdensome task.
Which is...
You're fucking Google.
God forbid.
God forbid some of your time
gets taken up.
Well, but no.
You're Google.
You have the best search
and indexing technology
on planet Earth.
You do this faster
and better than anyone.
And it says you can't
do a search
through your employees'
emails.
It's, I mean,
it's just ludicrous.
This also does make
Lib reactions to, like,
Trump just not responding
to subpoenas funny.
Or at least, like,
you know,
unbalanced.
It's like, yeah, wow,
I can't believe
he was just ignoring those.
That's like a new thing
for fucking rich people
in America to do now.
Yeah, this is great, Lib.
Oh, it sounds like
Julian's saying
that Democrats are insects.
I just think
it's unbalanced.
Good fucking one, man.
Judo.
They teach judo
in Canada, don't they?
Google was ultimately
fined $25,000,
again, less,
like a penny,
for impeding
the FCC investigation.
But they also determined
that the data collection
didn't break the law
because the information
wasn't encrypted.
So John Hankey
claimed no involvement
in the scandal
because it was done
by the mobile division,
not his geo division.
However,
the project was conducted
via Street View cars
operating on behalf
of Hankey's division.
And the other thing
is that, like,
because there was really
no investigation
into the matter,
we can't really know
how far it went,
exactly who was responsible
and who knew.
In 2010,
Hankey founded
Niantic within Google.
It was named after
a Gold Rush era ship.
Now, the first AR game
that they produced
was not Pokemon Go,
but it was actually
a game called Ingress,
which was later revamped
and renamed to Ingress Prime.
The premise of the game
is that Higgs boson research
at CERN released
a new kind of force
called exotic matter.
And all around the world,
there are these portals
surrounded by this exotic matter.
And these portals
happen to be,
you know,
local landmarks
like post offices
and businesses
and coffee shops and stuff.
Players choose between
one of two factions,
the Enlightened
and the Resistance,
and they fight
for control
of these portals.
The game is designed
to encourage cooperation
with other members
of your particular faction.
The only way forward
is to get out there,
pick a side,
and join the fight

and start exploring
the secret world around you.
But stay alert.
You'll have to outsmart
and outplay
the agents
of the other faction.
Cooperate and strategize
with agents
all around the world.
Google didn't really consider
Ingress to be
a commercial success.
You know why, Travis?
Because they were
targeting adults.
That's what they fucking realized.
These people are so fucking evil
that they're like,
okay, so we need
intellectual property
and the softest brains
in our country.
Children.
Perfect.
So the Niantic team
looked elsewhere
and perhaps to
already established IP.
And they found inspiration
in a Google April Fool's Day joke
which claimed that
Google was looking
for Pokemon Masters.
Pokemon Masters
are the world's
greatest digital explorers
and their passion
for exploring
will take our maps
to the next dimension.
It's always been important
to us to have
the most qualified
employees of Google.
Now, using the technology
created by the Google Maps team,
we've prepared
the most rigorous test
known to man
to find the world's
best Pokemon master.
So it was literally like,
hmm, we should use
Pokemon collectors
to like map out
the world for us.
Yeah, this is what
they call a trial balloon.
I wonder how people
will react to this
obviously evil thing.
Oh, good.
No reaction at all.
Oh, they're excited for it.
Go ahead.
Yeah, perfect.
In Pokemon Go's development,
data from Ingress
was used to populate
the locations
for the Pokestops
and the gyms.
And it was eventually
released on July 6, 2016.
And it became
an instant smash hit.
It destroyed the records
for the most revenue
grossed by a mobile game
in its first month
by earning $206.5 million.
And also,
it broke the record
for the most downloaded
mobile game
in its first month
by getting 130 million downloads.
It was just,
it was all of a sudden,
it was just non-existent,
just everywhere.
News stations,
both national and local,
carried stories
about the phenomena.
We're back now
with something
that may explain
any odd behavior
you've seen
on the streets recently.
The smash hit
mobile game app,
Pokemon Go,
has only been on
for a few days.
But it's already got millions
following their smartphones
to the most random places.
And police fear
possibly into harm's way.
NBC's Jolene Kent
has more.
Gotcha!
Pokemon fever
is back
and it's everywhere.
Nostalgia hits in,
like, I'm a kid,
I need to play this again,
it's real life.
Well, he texted me,
like, 30 minutes ago
saying let's meet up
in Hollywood
to catch Pokemon.
Trying to catch them all,
you know?
It's blanketing
Los Angeles hotspots
like Hollywood and Vine,
attracting hordes
of players to venture
outside to Central Park
in New York City
to stare at their phones.
We're so cooked.
Mm-hmm.
The context of all these crowds.
I feel a deep sadness.
I feel a deep sadness
watching this.
And, like,
these people had no idea
how bad things
were going to get.
They didn't know
they were, like,
literally spying for
and collecting data
for Google,
or the CIA, I guess.
Yes.
Once again,
organically,
the mainstream news
played along.
Just a perfect system,
very honestly.
They developed
a perfect system.
Those culpability
is kind of, like,
spread out.
I mean,
it's a trend.
I don't know.
Sometimes,
when it was reported
that a rare Pokemon
was spotted somewhere,
it caused stampedes,
like one that occurred
in New York City's
Central Park,
which was discussed
on Good Morning America.
Finally,
the quest to catch them all
continues.
Take a look at this crowd.
This is unbelievable.
Of Pokemon Go users
mobilizing into action
right here in New York City
after reports
that a Vaporeon,
this is one of the characters,
it's a very sought-after character,
as you can see.
Oh, my God.
It's a special Pokemon.
It's a special Pokemon.
It can morph into, like,
18 different Pokemon.
Exactly.
Well, it popped up
in New York City's
Central Park.
One man,
I'm talking a grown-up,
even jumped out of his car,
left the engine running
in the middle of New York City
in pursuit of that rare catch.
Oh, I didn't realize
that they can just, like,
if they want data
on a certain area,
they just drop a rare Pokemon
in the area.
This is so awesome
because basically
the gambit is that
Big Brother
can work,
not in the Orwellian sense,
but if you make it
an attractive enough product,
if there's treats,
then people will choose,
they will choose
to take Big Brother
in their own hands
and basically carry it out.
They will do
the surveillance themselves.
They will carry the phones
by choice.
It's a dick.
If Big Brother
has a little treat
and he's dangling it,
it's like,
see, if you don't think
the bad,
you know,
you get this little treat,
then people will do it.
What if Big Brother
had big rig haulers
and the best pussy in town?
Yeah, as long as you gamify
the surveillance state,
people will,
they'll do exactly
what you want
and they'll spend money
to do it more.
Yeah, Orwell was wrong.
They don't torture you
until you love Big Brother.
You love Big Brother
by choice.
You actively participate
in it because
it's got treats.
Yes.
But it's got to be
a good IP
and it's got to be,
it's got to be clicky,
you know,
it's got to be sticky.
We will beg for it.
We will beg for it.
After the game's release,
it immediately inspired
warnings about
its possible security threats.
A member of Egypt's
Committee of Defense
and National Security
told the Egyptian
Parliament this.
Pokemon Go
is the latest tool
used by spy agencies
in the Intel War,
a cunning,
despicable app
that tries to
infiltrate our communities
in the most innocent way
under the pretext
of entertainment.
But all they really want
is to spy on people
and the state.
Another W.
Yeah.
Russian media quoted
a retired FSB
major general
who expressed his worry
that the app
could be used
to recruit
unwitting spies.
Imagine that the little creature
in the question
doesn't appear in some park,
but on a secret site
where a conscript
or other soldier
takes and photographs
it with his camera.
It's recruitment
by one's own personal desire
and without any coercion.
This is the ideal way
for secret services
to gather information
and no one takes any heed.
Entertainment is fashion.
Unrashable after all.
Gotta hand it to him
on this one.
Yes!
It's the FSB.
Now, despite this,
Russian authorities
never banned
playing the game.
However, in 2022,
Niantic did make the game
no longer available
for download
in Russia and Belarus
after the invasion
of Ukraine.
In Indonesia,
the cabinet secretary
revealed during
a press conference
that he was a fan
of the game
and in fact
captured Pokemon
at the presidential
palace complex.
He told reporters this.
There are some
in the palace.
I have the application
so I can see.
At home,
the Pokemon are lame.
But around the national monument,
the Pokemon are top class.
Fuck me.
Fuck me.
Wow.
Evidently,
this cabinet secretary
did not read
an internal memo
from the Indonesian military
which later leaked
and it warned
about the issue.
Pokemon Go
is a game
that searches
for location-based Pokemon
and is a data collection system
for the National
Geospatial Intelligence Agency
which is similar
to what the CIA
has done to Facebook.
There was another incident
in Indonesia
when a 27-year-old
French man
was arrested
after following
digital Pokemon
onto a military base.
He was detained
for a few hours
and released
but a military spokesperson
told reporters
be wary of these
Pokemon ruses.
My lord,
they might have sent him
there on purpose.
That's so fucked up.
I mean,
I am fucking speechless
and I believe
this is an evil nation
but this truly,
genuinely,
is shocking
even to me.
They released a statement
that said,
it's possible
there could be
many strangers
trying to enter
private property
to commit crimes
but then pretend
to be hunting
Pokemons.
Oh my god,
so this is a whole
different level
is that you're not
even going to
accidentally stumble
on a base
looking for Pokemon.
You're going to
very directly
stumble on a base
claiming you were
looking for Pokemon.
It was just an accident.
They underestimated
how devious it is.
The person wandering
onto the base
doesn't even realize
what they are,
what they are,
what they're acting as.
It's amazing.
Genuinely the most
insidious and evil shit
I've heard in a long time
and I assume
that the stuff
we don't know about
is just like this.
Among Chinese citizens,
there was special concern
about the fact
that the game
was made through
a partnership
between American
and Japanese
game developers.
A message
on the social media
app Weibo
said this,
Don't play Pokemon Go.
It's so the US
and Japan
can explore China's
secret bases.
Then,
when war breaks out,
Japan and the US
can easily target
their guided missiles
and China will have
been destroyed
by the invasion
of a Japanese-American game.
Dubs.
It's an interesting,
yeah.
I don't know
if the Japanese
component of this
was a part of the...
Well, that's the whole thing
is they can only ever
be approximately right,
you know,
because it's so fucking
insidious
and hidden underneath
so many layers
of lies
and private,
public entities
and it's just...
Yeah.
So you can only ever
be kind of directionally correct
and another dub.
Yeah.
It's like I wouldn't
discount it.
That could be possible.
Now,
the CIA was also
concerned about the issue.
Through a Freedom of Information
Act request,
it was revealed that
CIA employees
received at least
two memos
warning about
Pokemon Go
in 2016.
There was one in July
right after the game's release
and there was another
in December
when the Office of Security
at the CIA
warned agency employees
about the security risks.
So this is the title
of that memo.
Are you at an agency facility?
Pokemon, no.
I mean,
that's the trick
is like how do you
warn people inside?
Because you've devised
such fucked up shit
and it's so insidious
that like you have to be like,
hey, by the way, guys,
if I were...
It's like the fucking thing
about 9-11.
Like, just don't show up
for work.
Yeah.
I'm just saying.
That's real.
I'm just saying
you just might not want to.
God.
Now, here's the funny thing
is that we don't actually know
the full extent
of what they were warned
because it's partially redacted.
There are like a couple sentences
that are blacked out.
So we don't know
the full extent of the warning.
But that memo
does offer these general guidelines.
Agency employees
are not authorized
to capture Pokemon
quote-unquote characters
while in or around
agency-controlled facilities.
Users should be mindful
of potential security
and counterintelligence concerns
when using the application.
That's awesome.
They don't even trust
their own private partners.
Yeah, of course.
They're like,
no, we're doing something
so evil,
but also like...
It's public private.
It could easily leak
because, you know,
there's a part...
Like, part of our disguise
is the fact
that there's a private arm
of this.
And the next Edward Snowden
might tell people
what we're doing
with Pokemon.
Right, because Edward Snowden
was public-private as well.
Like, that's how a lot
of the leaks come out
is like private people
who become privy to stuff.
Yes.
Fucking Ash.
Ash Ketchum was gonna
leak it.
Man, Travis,
thank you so much for this.
I mean, I just...
I feel so relaxed and good.
Great.
This is worse than any episode
I could write.
You knew.
You knew.
You just want to discredit me.
You want to fucking...
You want to wreck me.
You want to destroy my mind.
This is a limited hangout.
So, Pokemon Go was also causing problems
at NSA headquarters at Fort Meade.
This was according to a report
in Foreign Policy.
Now, this Foreign Policy report
relied upon former intel sources,
which, you know,
it has its credibility issues.
But I felt...
I would feel it wouldn't be complete
if I didn't at least
include this information.
So, here's what a former NSA official
told Foreign Policy.
People were doing dumb shit
with Pokemon Go.
Like playing in the parking lot
at Fort Meade.
Because there were apparently
like some super rare,
shiny Pokemons or something.
So, people were wandering campus
with their phones up.
The Foreign Policy article goes on
that U.S. counterintelligence officials
got anxious about the spying potential
of the game.
If some malignant actor
like a spy service
were able to successfully nominate
sites of intelligence interest
as Pokestops
or pay for Pokemon to appear near them
or otherwise access user data
from individuals playing the game
at sensitive locations
where Pokemon materialized
or where Pokestops were placed,
albeit even innocently,
it could represent
a new sort of espionage opportunity.
Then, in theory,
a bad actor like, say,
a foreign spy service
could collect geolocated intelligence
from these services
like audio or video data
or even simply gather information
on the phones themselves,
thus identifying
U.S. intelligence agency employees
or the specific digital signatures
of their phones
to facilitate some later compromise.
Good thing it was a good actor
that did it.
Their own intelligence services
were like,
actually, this seems like an evil plot.
I bet if some evil foreigner
was doing this,
that would be bad.
Not knowing that
they were doing it.
This is what compartmentalization
is designed to do.
You don't even know
the extent of the full evil.
You can't even see
the limbs of the fucking
many tentacled evil squid
that is this fucking
national security apparatus.
There's one more paragraph
if you feel like it.
This was precisely the fear at NSA
that enemy spy services
might place Pokemon Go
related infrastructure,
quote,
at targets of national interest
to lure Pokemon Go
playing intelligence officers
to those places
so they could collect
on their devices,
said a former NSA official.
However, the official added
this was completely
not grounded in reality.
I mean, this is interesting
because this, I mean,
this is essentially
this NSA official
is saying something
that worldwide
intelligence officials
are saying,
but they're adding,
but it's also not realistic.
Listen, we've designed
a rat trap so tasty
that our own people
are going to be sucked into it.
We can't control that, okay?
It's just that fucking tasty.
And the thing is just Pokemon.
That's the rat trap.
That's the thing
that they're sticking their head
and getting their neck snapped for.
Yeah.
It's just the virtual Pokemon.
Yes, yes.
This will be the face
of our future.
It will be fucking Mickey Mouse
stamped on the darkest shit on earth.
It's all treatlerism
all the way down.
That's why Trump kind of liked it.
Treatlerism?
Yeah.
Treatlerism, yes.
That was it.
The dollar menu
was cheaper
under Trump in 2019.
January 6th,
whatever,
who gives a shit?
I want my treats cheaper.
And I'll be the first
to sign up
for the Mickey Mouse
surveillance state.
I don't really have a choice
in the matter anyways.
I might as well
live under the baddest guys.
I'll be the last one.
Yeah, you might as well enjoy it.
I'll be the last one
to perish.
I'll enjoy my treats
the longest.
Sir, we've found
the perfect customer.
This man seems
genetically predisposed.
We must study his brain.
Which IPs,
which IPs
are the stickiest
for him?
They're going to put
a little bit of Jake
in vaccines
that they export abroad.
Make sure you inoculate
your whole population.
It wouldn't be such
a bad thing.
I think I've got
some pretty cool ideas.
Everyone in China
is now incredibly nice
to fast food workers
and also will buy
any product
and promote it
for free.
Ghostbusters
makes three trillion dollars.
Ghostbusters somehow
is making an insane
comeback in China.
Cadillac.
Cadillac is launching
a new line of hearses
to meet the demand
for people
wanting to drive
Ghostbuster cars.
Pretty soon,
every car on the road
will be...
Just the idea of it
sounds so great to me.
Of course.
I welcome this next phase.
Don't cross streams,
but it's like
an electromagnetic weapon.
It's like the proton packs
are real, actually,
but they won't work
unless you aim them
at a very specific
type of person.
God, imagine
it would be such
a fucking feat
to convince people
to wear something
so heavy
that apparently
has no purpose.
And yet...
Obviously,
what's spurring
all this paranoia
is that we know
that they're collecting
all of this data,
we just don't know
what for exactly.
Uh-huh.
But we recently
got an idea
of one use
of that data.
In a blog post,
Niantic says that
it's trading
a new AI
on millions
of real-world images
collected
by Pokemon Go players.
Specifically,
they're building
what they call
a large geospatial model.
And this is like,
you know,
how text artificial intelligence
is what they call
a large language model,
and it works
by being trained
on a massive amount
of real writing
from humans,
and from this,
it can generate
text responses
that seem intelligent
and natural.
So,
a large geospatial model
is like the same concept,
but applied
to the physical world.
Let's see,
let's see.
A perfect 3D model
of an urban environment
plus armed drones
with auto-pathing
and AI.
I really,
I just can't see the picture.
It's not coming together
for me.
How is it explained
in this blog post?
So,
it's like,
it's trained on
what real-world places
look like,
like a building
or something,
and they can use
that data
to produce information
on places
it hasn't seen yet,
not entirely.
So,
Niantic claims
that this could be useful
for technology
like AR glasses,
robotics,
content creation,
and other things.
But,
yeah,
I mean,
when I read this,
the first thing I thought
was like,
okay,
well,
yeah,
drones.
It's going to allow,
it's going to allow a,
it's going to allow a drone
to very easily navigate
anywhere on Earth
like with,
you know,
perfect efficiency.
Dude,
with,
oh my God,
it's like,
you are Abu Bakr
and you're just,
you're in your,
in your house
and you look out the window
and there's fucking
200 children
trying to capture Pokemon
on you
and that's when you hear
the sound of the approaching drones.
Here's how that blog post put it.
Imagine yourself
standing behind a church.
Let us assume
the closest local model
has seen only the front entrance
of that church
and thus,
it will not be able
to tell you
where you are.
The model has never seen
the back of that building.
But on a global scale,
we have seen a lot of churches,
thousands of them,
all captured by their respective
local models
at other places worldwide.
No church is the same,
but many share
common characteristics.
An LGM,
large geospatial model,
is a way to access
that distributed knowledge.
Wow,
so this,
is this just a dress
straight to the drones?
Yeah.
It's interesting,
like they want to do
the thing from,
like Batman.
Yes.
That's able to see
everywhere at all times.
But like,
in reality,
what's going to happen
is,
you know,
like that photo of,
it's like a blurred photo
of Obama
and then AI is trying
to like fill it in
and they fill in
like a white guy.
Like it's going to be
that essentially.
Yeah.
Imagine you see a church
or let's say a mosque
in,
I don't know,
Kabul.
Yeah.
And you know what I realized?
I think what they're describing here
is the technology
in that scene
in the movie
Enemy of the State
where the bad guys
in the NSA
are trying to figure out
if someone slipped
a tape of a murder
into Will Smith's bag.
But they only have like
one angle on it
from a security camera.
And so in order
to examine the bag
more closely,
they take that image
and then use
a computer program
to virtually rotate it,
allowing them
to essentially see
the, you know,
the other side of it.
Great comp, Travis.
Great movie.
Great comparison.
Great scene.
It's amazing to hear Jake
get to like a very grim conclusion
and then enter a fugue state
at the reference of a movie.
All right.
Now just before the view's blocked,
there's a shape change
in Dean's bag.
See the shadow variance?
See?
The shadow's wrong.
Zavitz changed the configuration
of Dean's packages.
Is it a tape?
It's hard to say for sure.
These things are...
Computer take us around
on the other side?
It can hypothesize, Chris.
Yeah?
Can you rotate us
75 degrees
around the vertical, please?
I remember when this movie came out,
like everyone who was like
really tech literate
is like, oh my God,
this is just like
Zoom enhance,
Zoom enhance,
like tech fantasy stuff.
Not real.
Not even possible.
Ludicrous.
But no,
now they're saying
not only is it possible,
but it's enabled
by everyone
who played Pokemon Go.
And they've been using
that exact technology
for sporting events
for the last couple years
where they put
a little circle,
like a little circle
around the football player
who has the ball
just like in Madden,
and then they'll actually
rotate around
during the replay.
They've been...
This technology
they've been using
right in front of our eyes
for sporting events.
And we all went,
cool.
We went,
cool,
the actual thing
looks more like
the video game
as opposed to,
oh,
the video game
is looking more
like the real sport.
Now it's like,
no,
we want it the other way.
We actually want reality
to look more like the game.
There is 0% chance
that sporting events
at this point
aren't just huge
data collection
engines
that have captured
every facial expression,
the way you move
your body,
how you react
to joy,
to sorrow.
Yeah,
it's good.
All feeding into
a computer that has
nothing but good intentions.
What do you guys think
NBA 2K
has learned
about me?
Well,
it's got a face scan.
Yeah,
it's got a face scan.
It knows that I'm
constantly trying
to create
the perfect Jordan.
It knows that I'm
willing to spend
upwards of $300 a year.
The result is that
when you are finally
put into that
white interrogation room,
the guy's just going
to walk in
and just look at you
and say,
all right,
Jake,
I know that you
really care about
Liv,
Julian,
and Travis,
but how would you
like to be black
and extremely tall?
I would be like,
as me,
like,
as just a regular person
or as me,
as a Jewish person
because that's different.
Because that's different.
Like,
you know,
my grandfather
always dreamed
six foot tall Jews
in the NBA dunking.
You know,
maybe I could help
achieve that vision.
He was pretty close.
It was Serbians.
Yeah.
And then I just hear
like three gunshots,
you know,
off camera.
Well,
I think it's funny.
I was like,
are you talking about
that technology used
in NFL games?
Because like,
in this movie,
it's portrayed as like,
oh,
here is the like,
the evil hyper advanced
technology used
by the deep state
that no one knows about
in order to like,
rob us of our privacy.
It's like,
it's like they know
things about us
that aren't even
captured on camera.
Their technology
is so advanced.
They're so evil.
But then when the
technology arrives,
where is,
is what we see it
as being used
in like,
you know,
in the fucking Cowboys game
we call sweet.
This is awesome.
Sweet.
Yeah.
Another angle.
Once we actually,
it becomes real.
We're not scared of it.
We're not worried
about its implications.
We think about
how rad it is.
You know,
one of the things
I think is,
is really,
I guess,
concerning about
like the questions
like,
well,
what did,
what did I agree to?
What did I agree to
when I took my daughter
to go and catch
Pokemon at Balboa Park?
I'm sure like legally,
like I agreed
to give up
the information
for the purpose
for this geospatial model,
which will maybe use
for drones
for nefarious purposes.
But,
but like,
I didn't really
specifically agree
to help make
enemy of the state
technology real.
I mean,
I don't think
if someone asked me,
it's like,
well,
so I tell you what,
you can go do this,
but what we're going
to do with this
is that we're going
to make enemy
of the state
technology real.
I'd be like,
oh,
no,
no,
maybe I'll find
something else
to do then.
Maybe at least
I would have
a little bit
more informed opinion.
No,
you agreed
to a geospatial model
of all of your holes.
Yeah,
it's not like
you can put
like one of those
x-ray bibs
over your body
and go and enjoy
Pokemon Go.
You know,
it's like,
you can't play it
without,
it's like every
fucking video game
now when you boot it up,
there's like all sorts
of license terms
and agreements
and legal contracts
and stuff
that you just,
you just,
I've never read
a single word
of one of those things
and I own
quite a few video games.
So,
like,
I've already signed,
I'm sure,
my life rights away,
you know,
just by being like,
oh,
I'll just get to the game
faster.
Yep.
It's like,
oh,
I guess he agreed
to the Manchurian
Canada clause.
That was easy.
There's just one thing
I want to mention
just for clarity's sake.
So,
so after all this
was reported
about how they're using
all this data
for this,
this AI geospatial model,
Niantic issued
a clarifying statement
saying that the data
comes from players
who like scan locations
rather than people
who just walk around
and catch Pokemon.
And here's what
that statement said.
We use player
contributed scans
of public real world
locations to help
build our large
geospatial model.
The scanning feature
is completely optional.
People have to visit
a specific publicly
accessible location
and click to scan.
This allows Niantic
to deliver new types
of AR experiences
for people to enjoy.
Merely walking around
playing our games
does not train
an AI model.
Do you remember
what happened
when we believed them
on a statement
that sounded
exactly like this
earlier in the episode?
They're just fucking
lying again.
Because why would they not?
Like what happened
last time they lied?
Nothing.
You have lost credibility.
They're actually taking
a 3D scan
of your pocket
while your phone
is off inside of it.
So yeah,
I mean,
this is the issue.
First of all,
I understand
how that's like better.
It's like,
no, no,
if you like do this thing
in the game,
then that's what we use
for the like perfect
drone technology.
There's not,
not,
not the catching the Pokemon.
It's the scanning
that does it.
So don't,
I understand how
this is supposed
to be comforting.
But also you're right.
I don't believe them.
Like they,
like tech companies,
they don't respect
consumer privacy.
They have no incentive to,
I don't trust regulators
to keep them in line,
but you know,
it sucks.
It sucks that,
it sucks that like
all this technology
is increasingly just,
just woven into
just everyday functions
of society.
And in,
in order to use
and participate
the technology
of society
in order to,
I have to,
I have to like engage
with like the middleman
of,
of social life.
We're these tech oligarchs
and that requires me
to contribute
to help us move forward
towards a total surveillance state.
And just like,
I don't,
it's just,
it wears you down.
It'll be like all,
it's like,
well,
I guess by playing this game,
by using the service,
by emailing people,
by booting up my computer,
by talking to the people
I care about,
by using these communication tools,
I,
I do contribute a little bit
towards the total surveillance state,
but you know,
what else,
what else are you going to do?
This episode was brought to you
by General Dynamics,
Boeing,
Lockheed Martin Corp,
Raytheon,
and Northrop Grumman.
And Travis.
Yeah,
great,
man.
Thank you so much,
man.
We were like,
hey,
let's enter this nice,
you know,
end of your period,
have some fun episodes.
And Jake has picked a movie
where Hulk Hogan is like Santa
or some shit.
And this is what you bring us,
Travis.
Thank you very much.
My pleasure.
Who knows?
The Hulk Hogan Santa movie
like might be really depressing.
Like,
we'll see.
You know I'm fragile.
And yet,
here we fucking are.
Thanking the listener
for tuning in
to another premium episode
of the QAA podcast
and telling them
we have a website
that hasn't been updated
in a little while,
but whatever.
We'll do it someday.
QAA podcast dot com.
Yeah.
And then we're finishing it off
by saying,
listener,
until next week,
may the deep dish bless you.
Yeah,
or you could even say like,
they're supposed to fucking
believe us.
you could say like,
Pokemon go to the deep dish,
you know,
Pokemon go to the website.
Pokemon go to the,
yeah,
Pokemon go to the website
that hasn't been updated.
Pokemon go to Julian's house
and give him a hug.
I think that,
uh,
I was going to say,
Pokemon go to
and Travis view.
What?
What did I say?
We have auto keyed content
based on your preferences.
So after the deal with NVIDIA,
we also had done a deal with CNN.
Uh,
it turns out that,
uh,
a junior high school friend of mine
was now the CTO of CNN.
And,
uh,
I met him at,
uh,
the national association broadcasters meeting.
And,
uh,
he got excited about using keyhole
and actually did a deal to pay us
to use keyhole on air
and include our logo on the screen
as part of the deal.
So,
you know,
we gave him a good price,
but it was,
it was actually a good enterprise deal
for us as well.
But we got branding
on the screen
every time they used keyhole
to,
uh,
sort of talk about a new story.
And in early 2003,
the U S invaded Iraq
and suddenly everybody was watching CNN
all the time.
and CNN was using keyhole
to show what was going on in Iraq,
you know,
for sometimes minutes at a time.
Uh,
one of the broadcasters,
Miles O'Brien,
uh,
had,
you know,
five or 10 minute sessions
where he would just use keyhole
and talk about things in the images
and zoom in and out
and jump to different places.
And so everybody saw this
and immediately said,
Hey,
does this work in my,
on my computer?
And we got more downloads
than we knew what to do with.
Um,
it was an incredible time.
Our servers,
uh,
in a,
uh,
uh,
sort of a dungeon downstairs
in a,
uh,
um,
Palo Alto basement,
uh,
got severely overloaded
and,
um,
it would take minutes
for it.
Sometimes the data to download,
uh,
the people didn't care.
It,
it worked eventually.
And once it was in your cache,
you could see it again.
Uh,
so,
you know,
that in many ways
saved the company,
um,
because we sold a lot
of subscriptions
and,
uh,
you know,
the awareness
about the product,
uh,
basically grew a hundred
or even a thousand fold.
Um,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
