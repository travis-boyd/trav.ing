On this season, we'll explore our most ingrained beliefs, delusions, and archetypes,
the ways that cognitive dissonance shapes our culture, and how our reality is created
by the stories we tell. I'm your host, Chelsea Weber-Smith, and this is American Hysteria.
The attractive home of John and Margaret Bryant, the home they've always dreamed of, the happiest
investment they have ever made. So many people these days, we live in the suburbs, and I was
practically a prisoner in my own home. Well, I just could not live beside them. I moved here
because it was a white community. Stop and listen to me. Listen. Listen. Listen to me.
They're not human.
The old dregs, the old difficulties, take me to wife. Goals stiffen to their chill vigil
in the drafty half-light. I enter the lit house.
Like so many gloomy teenagers growing up in the suburbs, I was obsessed with Sylvia Plath,
a confessional poet writing through the most quintessentially suburban of decades, the 1950s.
If you aren't a fan of poetry, you may still know Plath, as most people do, for her famous
suicide, her head in one of the most domestic of symbols, the oven, breathing in the gas until
she fell asleep and died. Sylvia Plath has become something of a relic now, a symbol of the oppression
of the domestic, of motherhood, of suburbia, how it takes away the real and replaces it with a
repressive and almost horrifying boredom and uniformity. Always the brutal dramatic, she wrote,
there's a hex on the cradle and death in the pot. There's a hypnotic notion created by both the
duplicate houses and their lawns, as well as popular culture's spin. A hint that these suburbanites are
nothing more than sentient zombies, their days manufactured like the Truman Show's literal
staged reality. In the early days of TV, rosy suburban innocence was all the rage, showing perfect
families whose lives generally involved problems as complex as whether to use a stamp collection to
buy a sewing machine or a rowboat. On the other end of the spectrum, sci-fi and horror movies have
often sought to expose and dissect the dark underbelly of suburbia, taking a certain pleasure
in shattering the illusion. Whether you have fond memories of playing tag on the lawn, or memories of
being trapped in an insidious boredom, or watching with a confused distaste from outside, or hoping to
get there one day, the suburbs, of course, have a deeply complicated past. This past is rooted in a great
fire that devastated Chicago in 1871 and prompted a melting pot of the newly homeless from all classes
and walks of life, and the subsequent exodus of the privileged. This escape from the city only
increased in the post-war years as manufactured housing communities, beginning with modern-day Long
Island, offered comforting uniformity to a nation devastated by the horrors of World War II and the
Depression. The new suburban communities were designed also to imitate what had been lacking in the city,
a return to what we'll call the pastoral fantasy, which refers to the original American dream,
the expansion out, the conquering and connection to a wild new land, to nature itself. Sylvia Plath once wrote,
Spare me from cooking three meals a day. Spare me from the relentless cage of routine and rote. I want to be free.
Just like the pastoral fantasy, a yearning for the real is as much a mark of the suburban archetype as an
unblemished front lawn. Steeped in the boring safety of the middle and upper classes, the real has also meant
a longing for passion and even danger absent from a cloistered existence. Sylvia Plath, regardless of her
beautiful contributions to American poetry, has been admonished for some of the more racist lines in her
writing, a sense of white superiority, the kind that helped keep the suburbs violently segregated.
As seen in the 1998 pop drama Pleasantville, Suburbia has expressed its devotion to the program responses
of a Disney-fied happy perfection. But hiding inside that safety, too, is a longing for more,
a longing for danger, a longing that many of us understand. But do any of us actually understand
what it is we're longing for? In October of 1871, one of the worst fires in American history
decimated the rapidly growing city of Chicago, killing 300 people and leaving 100,000 residents
homeless, one-third of their population. The ill-prepared government did what they could to
create emergency shelters, but the relatively unaffected super-elite of the city believed
that the mixing of races and genders inside these shelters threatened the morality of the social order.
Pretentiously, they said of the emergency barracks, quote,
so large a number, brought into promiscuous and involuntary association,
would almost certainly engender disease and promote idleness, disorder, and vice.
This group, known as the Relief and Aid Society, was worried about the fate of the middle class,
which they believed were the driving force behind the increasing prosperity of Chicago.
The group quickly came up with a new idea, and they began constructing single-family cottages
on the outskirts of the devastated city.
With the fire as its catalyst, this suburbanization was, in essence, an escape from increasing immigration.
Very quickly, new European immigrants were the majority in Chicago, accounting for two-thirds of the population
and what was considered the moral deviance of the lower classes.
Chicago, like most other growing cities, housed the rich, middle class, and poor side-by-side in apartments and boarding houses,
with brick homes as a show of wealth and wooden homes the opposite.
Shortly after the fire, the city became much more intimate,
as middle and lower class residents wandered the streets of Chicago with nowhere to go.
This prejudice mess of all types of people,
and the fact that a middle class banker could find himself beside an immigrant sex worker
taking cover under a bridge, shook the middle class residents to their core.
Of course, the city needed a villain,
and a kind of urban legend began circulating through the wealthier communities.
It was a fable about the dangers of class mixing,
the wooden cottage symbolizing the danger of the poor,
this fire kindling so close to the mansions of the rich.
The fire story most widely circulated is that an Irish immigrant named Catherine O'Leary
was milking her cow, which back then you could still find people doing in the city,
and this cow had kicked over a kerosene lamp into the hay, setting the building ablaze.
Just like today, the media and vicious moralists came for Catherine.
It wasn't just that she'd been allegedly responsible for starting the fire,
but that she shouldn't have been milking her cow that late at night,
shouldn't have needed that kerosene lamp.
She was painted as a lazy, irresponsible immigrant woman out too late,
living a rural life in an urban town instead of the new lifestyle that marked the middle class.
The story continued to grow more and more sensational
when the Chicago Times claimed that Catherine had started the fire
as a vengeance against the city that had denied her relief aid.
The article read, quote,
The old hag swore that she would be revenged on a city that would deny her a bit of wood
or a pound of bacon.
A hit song wound through the city with a chorus that said, quote,
a cow could kick over Chicago.
Five nights ago when we were all in bed,
bum, bum, bum, Mrs. O'Leary left a lantern in the shed,
and when the cow kicked it over,
she winked her eye and said,
it'll be a hot time in the old town tonight.
Fire, fire, fire.
Poor Catherine gave interviews disputing all of the stories that were slandering her name,
swearing up and down that she always milked her cows on time,
and that she had been in bed that night by 8.30,
an hour before the alleged cow kick.
Her neighbors all confirmed her story,
but now Catherine was more than herself.
She was the catalyst that justified the segregated suburbs as we still know them today.
So if it wasn't Catherine, as the newspapers eventually admitted,
there was another shady blank character that entered the scene,
who was sneaking around the O'Leary home the night of the fire.
He was, of course, a communist,
and the Chicago Times changed their tune, quote,
a startling story, fiendish work by communist incendiaries,
and a, quote,
diabolical plot for the destruction of the city
by a Parisian agent trying to incite a revolution of the lower class.
The story of a stride toward equality seemed to terrify the middle class
almost more than the fire itself.
Those pretty little cottages on the outskirts of the immigrant-majority city
were starting to look pretty good,
and off they went, the middle class,
to build a new American dream.
As we've talked about before,
World War II produced a devastating emotional state for the collective nation,
and the huge influx of soldiers returning home
wanted the things they'd been dreaming about,
love, marriage, children, stability, and happiness.
Groundwork for a new solution
had been laid by famous architect Frank Lloyd Wright,
a man with a disdain for the city
and a great appreciation of nature,
as well as cheap production.
He started having a vision he called Usonia,
a combination of USA and utopia.
But it wasn't until the sudden influx of shaken soldiers
returning from Europe
that there became an urgent need for affordable luxury housing.
And in 1947,
a man named William Levitt seemed to have a kind of mass solution,
an extension of that idea,
and he would go on to become the father of the manicured suburbia
as we know it today.
Using Henry Ford's assembly line structure,
Levitt came up with a plan to create neighborhoods
in what is now modern-day Long Island.
He wanted to do so quickly, efficiently,
and, of course, as cheaply as possible.
His vision represents the pop culture images we've absorbed of suburbia,
identical houses side by side,
each with the same appliances.
750 square feet,
two bedrooms,
a living room,
a kitchen,
and a bathroom.
No basements,
no garages.
They didn't have time for that.
Levitt kept the prices low enough
so that young couples could afford a down payment
and move in immediately,
and that was a good thing.
As the morning before the Levittown homes went on sale,
people had actually camped out in front of his office.
And by morning,
there was a line of 1,500 families gathered and waiting.
But everyone in that line was white,
one of the cardinal rules of this new suburban life.
Levittown called itself a, quote,
private haven in a heartless world
where parents wouldn't have to worry.
Here, they were safe,
just like they were safe on the outskirts of a burned-out Chicago.
Here, everything was straightforward,
clear in its boundaries,
clear in its traditions,
and clear in its rules.
With these segregated islands,
only really accessible by the luxury of a car,
suburbia was slowly becoming a white middle-class haven,
away from the crime, poverty,
black people, and immigrants.
And this is Levittown.
Here, you can own your own home,
complete with its own refrigerator,
television set, and clothes dryer.
You can raise your children far from the city's dirt,
crowding, and crime,
in comfort and safety.
It became a way of starting to forget
the horrors of war and extreme poverty,
of ignoring the terrifying and looming threat of nuclear war,
and of forgetting the problems
that still plagued the poor residents of the city,
as they sat drinking lemonade on the lawn.
As the 1950s bounced on its newly peppy heels,
the popularity of the cloistered Cold War lifestyle grew and grew,
with the pastoral fantasy of old America
colliding with the modern middle-class American obsession
with mass-produced goods that made life easier
and pointed carefully toward the future.
As Disneyland opened in 1955
and television streamed finally into the majority of middle-class homes,
suburbia seemed to emulate that kind of bright-eyed fantasy
manicured by the growing presence of corporations.
A whole Disney-fied nation,
life imitating life in the safest possible way.
From World War II to the 1960s,
the suburban population doubled,
and those sprawling consumer palaces,
called shopping malls,
began to become the heart of 1950s suburbia.
Along with aiding in the continued psychological repression
of the nuclear threat with bright colors and strict gender roles,
American nationalistic family values profited handsomely
off the new affluence of this middle class.
Corporations were responsible for those first domestic comedies
like Father Knows Best,
Leave It to Beaver,
and The Andy Griffith Show,
all of them nuclear family-centered stories
transmitted to a significant portion of American households.
These programs were about the easy,
often fun problems of suburbia,
the boring disagreements hugged out before the end credits,
the simple, obedient messages writ large and sweet.
But of course, the corporations weren't doing this
out of the kindness of their hearts.
They did it so they could play their loud
and sometimes aggressive commercials
that cut like a knife
through the warm cake of American television.
Unsurprisingly, the government, too,
supported this middle-class suburbia,
both financially and symbolically,
as a beacon of the hope against,
you guessed it,
the communist threat.
Vice President Nixon escorts Soviet Premier Khrushchev
on a preview of the United States Fair
at Skolniki Park in Moscow.
It's the official opening of the American Exposition
and dedicated to showcasing
the highest standard of life in our country.
In 1959, a bizarre televised kitchen debate
took place between Vice President Richard Nixon
and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev
arguing on behalf of communism.
Though the talk was held in Moscow,
it was filmed in an American ranch house
built in the style of those at Levittown,
just for this kitchen talk,
cut in half so that bystanders and viewers
could see inside the mystical suburban kitchen
and the lifestyle of convenient goods
that made America great.
Unimpressed, this Soviet leader,
referring to the comfortable lives
that Americans were obsessed with,
asked sarcastically if there was also a machine
that, quote,
puts food into the mouth and pushes it down,
followed by his parting words,
thank the housewife for letting us use her kitchen
for our argument.
Ah, the housewife,
one of the most enduring symbols
of a bygone America,
created in the 1950s and 60s,
coined by the media as a Mrs. America.
We've been taught about her dual nature.
On one end, a cookie-cutter happy mother,
content with her husband's arrival home,
her children's well-being,
the meals she lovingly prepared for both.
And on the other end,
a depressed, anxious, gossipy, hysterical thing,
one that was begging internally,
emotionally,
for more of that thing called life.
It's true that the diagnosis of anxiety
and depression soared during this decade,
and psychologists who'd long been following
the Freudian model of psychotherapy,
of curing nervousness and hysteria
by addressing childhood issues,
were now presented with the science
to stop neurosis.
The drug known eventually as Mother's Little Helper
was mass-produced to meet the needs
of those discontented women,
but really, oftentimes,
they were meant to placate them
back into contentment.
Relaxed, alert, attentive.
She is able to listen carefully
to PTA proposals.
The Milltown ads trumpeted,
frigid women who abhorred marital relations
reported they responded more readily
to their husbands' advances.
And, of course,
you can't set her free,
but you can help her feel less anxious.
The world had seen problems
with anxiety drugs before,
as barbiturates,
more powerful sedatives,
had caused addiction
in the previous decades.
A film was shown to doctors
to prove the effectiveness
and difference between barbiturates
and Milltown,
using monkeys as their test subjects.
With a scientist dramatically donning
a pair of thick gloves
and a welding mask,
the monkey is presented
as violent and out of control,
then cut to the monkey
blasted on barbiturates,
nearly unconscious,
and then cut to the Milltown monkey,
chill but alert,
happy,
a cool monkey,
the kind of monkey
that might bring you a beer,
the kind of monkey
who might have dinner ready for you,
the kind of monkey
that would never,
ever complain.
And monkey see,
monkey do, right?
By 1956,
doctors had written
36 million prescriptions
for Milltown,
mostly for women,
leading eventually
to one in three American adults
popping the colors
on a regular basis,
almost like the M&Ms
that were marketed
by the same ad agency.
Wonder Bread, too.
What else did advertisers
Ted Bates and company do?
Well,
they peddled Milltown
purposefully
to the drug-loving
Hollywood elite,
who were very down to clown
and invented cocktails
called Miltinis,
which were
martinis garnished
not with an olive,
but with a couple of Milltowns.
Lucille Ball,
Tennessee Williams,
and Lauren Bacall
were all famous
for taking Milltown,
and the gossip magazines
let bored American mothers
know all about it.
The world of upper
and middle-class America
was grossly over-prescribed
these meds,
leading the scientist
who discovered
the effectiveness
of the compound
to state his belief
that true anxiety disorders
had been hopelessly trivialized.
But there were those
living in suburbia
that experienced
more severe mental illness
and more severe reactions
to a life that felt,
well,
lifeless.
Our favorite depressive poet,
Sylvia Plath,
would spend her life
in and out of institutions,
like many creative women
of her time,
and would undergo
several rounds
of shock treatment
over the years.
Her deeply personal,
confessional poems
seemed to capture
the housewife's darker story,
the one hidden
under the uncanny
motherly perfection
that she just couldn't
seem to achieve,
that she just couldn't
seem to want.
Stuck in a fraught marriage,
stuck with the burden
of motherhood,
she felt that this world
was not where she belonged.
Mental illness
and discontent
would be the end
of Sylvia Plath,
but she would leave behind
poems that emulated
that strife.
Her words often pointed
to the brutal and dim boredom
of domestic life,
the lie of it all,
the absence of meaning
that marked it for her.
In Tale of a Tub,
she writes,
quote,
Just how guilty are we
when the ceiling reveals
no cracks
that can be decoded,
when Washbowl maintains
it has no more
holy calling
than physical ablution,
and the towel
dryly disclaims
that fierce troll faces
lurk
in its explicit
folds.
However,
this mentally ill poet
that I've always loved
had an unfortunately
common
racist streak.
One scene
in her famous novel
The Bell Jar,
which was more or less
a memoir,
the main character
named Esther
kicks a black orderly
during her stay
in a mental institution.
His crime?
Serving her
two different kinds
of beans.
Regardless of the
sexist tolls
that were felt
by many of the
suburban women
at the time,
being considered
an anxious housewife
was really only possible
in white middle class
and upper class families,
as the majority
of the lower class
needed a paycheck
from both husbands
and wives
and were often seen
as unable to experience
this classy anxiety.
Lower class folks
did not have access
to the same kind
of psychiatric care
and thus were not
diagnosed with anxiety
problems and medicated,
but instead
in some situations
were forced
to self-medicate
with illegal drugs
that would then
have them arrested,
just like today.
So we have
the suffering
of the misunderstood
psychological issues
of sexist oppression,
but at the same time
we have the invisible
suffering of the poor
and people of color
that really didn't
interest those white women,
but instead
often revolted them
as they stood
behind the husbands
they had to blindly honor
in order to be
socially accepted.
They are very close
to the Levittown norm
except in one respect.
William Myers Jr.
and his family
are Negroes
in an all-white community.
Why did you select
Levittown to live?
We were looking
for a place
to buy a home.
We looked at Levittown
and we liked the homes here.
We liked the advantages
that Levittown
seemed to offer
in comparison
to other cities.
And we understood
that it was going
to be all-white
and we were very happy
to buy a home here.
Let's head back
to Levittown
or at least
one of the many iterations
that would pop up
following the first version
in Long Island.
By 1957,
the Levittown
in Pennsylvania
had unknowingly
become home
to its first
Black residents,
the Myers family,
made up of a young couple
and their three children.
Former Pennsylvanian
William Myers
was a World War II
Army veteran,
now an engineer,
and Daisy Myers
had obtained
a bachelor's degree
in education.
This Black family
had reached
the middle class.
And as they appeared
suddenly,
walking into the front door
of 43 Deep Green Lane
in the Dogwood Hollow,
shocked men
grew increasingly angry.
Women touched
their tight faces
and said,
quote,
Oh my,
they are here.
Can you believe it?
The first news report
followed soon after
when the Bucks County
Courier Times
reported,
quote,
the first Negro family
to buy a home
in Levittown.
But Levitt
didn't know anything
about it
and he wanted to know
how they managed
to move in
without his knowledge.
It turned out
that a previous owner
had sold his house
to the Myers
over the phone
and it's likely
that he did not
ask Mr. Myers
to disclose his race.
Their family
did not fly
under the radar
as they hoped
that they might
and within hours
of the Bucks County article,
a crowd was forming
outside their house.
They stayed late
into the night,
yelling,
intimidating,
threatening,
with teenagers
throwing rocks
through their front window.
The cop arrived
to break up the mob
around 12.30 a.m.
with the sheriff
asking desperately
for backup
from the state police,
telling them that,
the citizens of Levittown
are out of control.
The violent intimidation
only escalated
and eventually a mob
headed over
to Walt Disney
Elementary School
where someone
had lit
an eight-foot
bamboo cross
on fire.
Soon after,
a coalition of 500
was formed
that they called
the Levittown
Betterment Committee,
whose mission
was to remove
the Myers family
by any legal means
necessary.
In an emotional blow
to the veteran
William Myers,
these meetings
were held
at the Veteran
of Foreign Affairs
post.
Eventually,
after many weeks,
after another cross
was burned
at a local
elementary school
and many mobs
had stood outside
the modest ranch house,
the Myers were
no longer plagued
with a constant
crowd of racists
yelling at their house
at all hours,
but they still
received constant
threats,
with one neighbor
hoisting a Confederate
flag,
blaring Old Man River
constantly,
day and night,
through a loudspeaker.
The Myers family
would live
in Levittown
four more years
before finally
deciding
to move back
to Pennsylvania.
These extremely
dark aspects
of this upstanding
American wonderland
were showing.
These suburbanites
were not good people
by virtue of
where they lived
or how much money
they had
or how perfect
their communities
seemed to look.
The same kind
of horror
that Sylvia Plath
expressed in her poems
was a kind of
compacted version
of what more
well-known artists
would expand out
in the coming decades.
This horror
would go on
to permeate the culture
and haunt the
cul-de-sacs
of happy,
well-manicured
neighborhoods
to the present day,
leading writers
and directors,
who were once
teenage members
of these communities,
to rebel against
the creepy conformity
of their own
plastic pretend
pasts.
The ultimate
middle-class fantasy
in the 1950s
and 60s
was the very
trendy ownership
of a nuclear
bomb shelter.
It was pretty much
an unspoken competition
to make the cutest
and most ingenious
hidey-hole
to protect against
the horrific
nuclear death
that could rain down
at any moment.
Their children
in elementary school
learning to duck
and cover,
pretending that
putting your arms
over your head
could do anything
at all.
But this head-in-the-clouds,
head-in-the-sand
mentality was,
perhaps,
a required
cognitive dissonance,
and to borrow
the subtitle
of Dr. Strangelove,
it was how they
learned to love
the bomb.
In every American
mall,
you could buy
yourself a
pre-made bomb shelter,
and stacked beautifully
inside these bomb shelters,
you could find
all of the hottest
brands to make sure
that you can take
them down with you
for the end of times.
However,
this cognitive dissonance
to the younger generation
was really dark.
As Sylvia Plath
might have seen it,
a bomb shelter
decorated with curtains
that lead only
to the cold metal
behind them.
Witnessing the
uncanny valley
of dummies
dressed in
popular American
brands,
set in suburban
houses way out
in the desert,
shown in glossy
magazines,
shown as things
you could buy
and then blown up
in a nuclear test,
was not lost
on the coming-of-age
baby boomers.
As the horrific
truths of the
Vietnam War
were revealed
to the new generation,
they, thankfully,
revolted in vital ways.
Due to the economic
prosperity of the time,
teens and young adults
of this
me generation,
as baby boomers
were originally called,
created a rapid
cultural switch,
a focus on
self-investigation
and the internal world,
which we cover in depth
in our episode
called Mind Control.
This, in turn,
led to a more
liberal attitude
that focused on
the need for
real experiences
over corporate
conformity.
This majority
middle-class movement
wanted the opposite
of the seemingly
perfect and safe
lives they had
grown up in,
and so many
took off hitchhiking
and joined the
anti-war and civil
rights movements,
taking mind-expanding
drugs and having a lot
of unmarried sex
and trying,
a bit sloppily,
to face ugly
American realities
that had long
been ignored.
Up-and-coming directors
drew from their
own lives
as previous
suburbanites,
and pop culture
began to turn
on the suburbs
and the nuclear
family.
You govern the
forming of
human flesh and
blood out of
thin air is,
well,
it's fantastically
powerful,
beyond any
comprehension.
Stop it!
Listen to me!
Listen!
Listen!
Listen to me!
They're not human!
These new
creatives believed
that they could
see through the
veneer and into
the darkness of
suburbia,
the so-called
moral middle class
of the bourgeoisie
utopia.
The cracks in the
ceiling,
the ones Sylvia Plath
wrote about,
were showing.
Films like
The Stetford Wives
and Dawn of the
Dead painted
suburbanites as
robotic and
zombified.
David Lynch's
blue velvet
scandalized
audiences and
cast perhaps the
darkest pop
cultural shadow
yet on the
landscape of the
middle class.
This evil
suburban trope
became so
omnipresent
throughout these
decades that a
subgenre was
formed called
suburban gothic
and included
titles like
Poltergeist,
Nightmare on Elm
Street,
Halloween,
Scream,
People Under the
Stairs,
Edward Scissorhands,
Serial Mom,
Donnie Darko,
Buffy the Vampire
Slayer,
and more recently
Weeds,
Desperate Housewives,
Stranger Things,
Pretty Little Liars,
The Society,
Good Girls,
and Big Little Lies.
Dark suburbia is
now so ubiquitous a
plot device as to no
longer be really
noticeable at all.
The interesting part
about suburban
gothic was that the
genre began to focus
not on the threat of
the dangerous
outsider,
but instead insisted
that the core of
the apple was
already rotten.
The problem wasn't
them.
It was us.
As we talked
about, the Chicago
Fire created a
sudden racial,
cultural, and
class mixing and
led to the first
great middle and
upper class white
flight.
In the post-war
years, the suburbs
as we know them
were created by
designers like
William Levitt and
legally segregated to
keep them as
white as possible.
However, in the last
25 years since our
Great Recession,
more and more
immigrant families are
moving into the
suburbs, which have
become home to 50%
of their populations.
39% of black folks
now live in many
suburbs, like
Ferguson, Missouri,
that were once
99% white and are
now more than 50%
black.
Possibly due in part
to these demographic
and economic changes,
that Eusonia, that
USA utopia that
architects like Frank
Lloyd Wright and
William Levitt
originally imagined,
looks completely
different today.
And maybe that's why
we're starting to see
a kind of reversal of
white flight that
once characterized the
suburbs.
We're starting to see
an exodus of the
white middle and
upper classes moving
back to the city,
looking for that
authenticity that their
boring suburban
childhoods seem to
lack.
As tech metropolises
like Amazon move
into urban centers,
they bring with them
swaths of young and
affluent people who,
meaning to or not,
reshape the landscape
they live in.
Here in Seattle, it
seems that ugly
condos pop up daily,
replacing the
affordable brick
buildings that once
lined the avenues,
bringing new luxury
buildings that, in a
lot of ways, mimic the
suburbs.
They all look eerily
similar, and the
condos inside are as
large as houses, with
lawns and gardens and
trees living in a square
at the very top of the
very tall building.
And sometimes you can
even find chicken coops
and dog parks.
It seems that as the
middle class returns to
the city, we cannot leave
that pastoral fantasy
behind.
So we'll put it way up
high at the top of our
tower, out of reach from
those who never left.
the city.
Remember why you moved
to the suburbs?
Lots of fresh air.
A big lawn for the
family.
Plenty of room to enjoy
that good life.
But what about time to
enjoy that good life?
Has that big lawn got
you tied down like a
cook in an all-night
diner?
Then open up your
weekends with an Alice
Chalmers lawn and
garden tractor.
Yes, it's a good life for
those who find the
time.
These lawns that
inspired these yuppie
rooftops were at the
heart of William
Levitt's planned
community in the late
1940s.
He demanded that each
home have a front lawn
of well-manicured
grass, no more and no
less than two trees,
with each pair the exact
same distance apart.
This contrived homage
to nature was
popularized first in
1841, when early
landscape designer
Andrew Jackson
Downing wrote of the
almost spiritual
practice of lawn care.
In Treatise on the
Theory and Practice of
Landscape Gardening,
Downing's concept of
the lawn was a way to
reach some kind of
Plato-esque ideal.
In the landscape garden,
we appeal to that sense
of the beautiful and the
perfect, which is one of
the highest attributes of
our nature.
He wrote.
Like Pizza Hut's
personal pan pizzas,
our lawns are personal
pan pastoral fantasies.
We want the realness of
the wild, our favorite
historical heroic danger,
cushioned with a newfound
post-war privileged
safety.
We don't care about the
cost.
Our ornamental lawns
wasting water to
outrageous degrees,
emitting dangerous
greenhouse gases from
their fertilizers,
chemicals, and mowers,
with lawns being the
most irrigated crop in
the country and for
what.
Since the 1940s,
there have been these
things called weed laws
on the books, and in
some rare cases, people
have even been arrested
for not keeping a well-trimmed
lawn.
As we've heard on this
episode and the entirety of
American Hysteria,
metaphorically speaking,
the privileged have long
done whatever it takes to
snuff out those people
considered the weeds.
Our archetypes of this
perfect, unblemished
American lawn, along with
the original suburban
visions that carry through
in some ways to the
present day, could be
considered metaphorically
to represent our
homogenous American dream.
All suburban women were
truly experiencing the
pressures of a sexist
American dream, and a
shocking number were
popping pills in part to
deal with a grinding
boredom and a lack of
existential meaning.
This was a painful and
serious reality, but it's
true, too, that so many
women were overprescribed
medication during this
time period.
And this anxiety and
depression, this
existential boredom, at
the end of the day, was
also a privilege, or at
least the acknowledgement
of it was.
Remember, the only people
who were prescribed
milltown were those white
people of the middle and
upper class.
Poor folks and people of
color were not considered
smart enough, not
considered part of the
thinking class.
Therefore, blissfully
unaware of the bigger
existential questions
that cast a long and
dark shadow of boredom
across the kitchen table,
where the women could
almost make out their
reflection, at least the
shape of it.
For others, they could
only dream of a boredom
that came from money and
free time, something
sorely lacking inside the
city.
The cognitive dissonance
of post-war American
suburbia, the bomb
shelters, the sexism, the
racism, the syrupy
happiness that seemed to
cover the neighborhoods
like coats of fresh paint.
This culture was
encapsulated in that poem
we talked about earlier,
Tale of a Tub, one
written in 1956 by our
girl Sylvia Plath.
She knew that those around
her were, quote,
disguising the constant
horror in a coat of many
colored fictions.
We mask our past in the
green of Eden.
A potent example of much
of what we've discussed
here is represented within
the 1998 magical realism
dramedy Pleasantville,
which I just watched again
for the first time in like
10 years.
In the movie, accidentally
using a supernatural remote,
teenage siblings, played by
Reese Witherspoon and
Tobey Maguire, are made to
enter a 1950s black and
white sitcom called
Pleasantville that's not
unlike Leave it to
Beaver.
In this perfect post-war
town, there is no such
thing as fire, no such
thing as rain.
The high school basketball
team makes every single
shot they take, and wives
have laughably large
breakfasts and dinners laid
out at the exact same time
every day and always with a
smile.
The residents, the teenagers
soon realize, know nothing
outside of the town.
In fact, the road simply
circles back to Pleasantville,
and their geography classes
look only at the
intersections of their own
quiet streets.
The residents, too, have no
consciousness of their precise
prescribed roles, mortified and
confused when the expected,
respectable responses are not
delivered.
At Tobey Maguire's insistence
that they don't alter the town,
the teens play along.
But with their dangerous 90s
worldwide wherewithal, the teens
soon find themselves altering the
landscape of this extremely
repressed community, showing them
the magic of sex, which they've
never heard of, masturbation, which
they've certainly never heard of,
art which they've never seen,
passionate fighting, passionate
love, and color itself, represented
by the town's sudden introduction to
the authentic human experience.
As black musicians Miles Davis and
Etta James begin to play in the
background, and the roses and the
paint and the fire and the blood
burst into color, the film takes an
admittedly shaky political turn.
There are no black people in
Pleasantville, but those who have
been touched by this realness are
shown in full color.
In fact, they're problematically
called colored people, while those,
mainly older white men, cling to the
past angrily and stay their original
black and white.
Those who have received their color
are treated in ways that mimic the
Jim Crow era, like harassment,
destruction of property, and
eventually segregation.
It's a little obtuse, attempting to
paint the reality of the Jim Crow era
suburbia, but refocuses again on the
white yearning for the real, with a
painful historical black narrative
appropriated for that white yearning
for realness.
Our story of suburbia is simultaneously
a lucky avoidance of danger and a deep
yearning for it.
That realness can come from faraway
nature that we want to corral into our
own control, our pastoral fantasy, that
original, unpredictable, wild American
dream.
Or it can come from that realness that
would crack open our plastic hearts and
give us something to cry about.
Something to really love.
Art, fire, rain.
Some kind of a brutal truth.
Some kind of dangerous passion that the
cloistered lives of our pop suburbia has
always seemed to lack.
In my own suburb in the 1990s and early
2000s that was far from the examples we've
talked about today, I still wanted this
realness too.
And in terms of where I lived, I was
safe.
I was a teenager reading Sylvia Plath's
final book called Ariel, assembled by
her controversial husband after her
suicide.
Draped across the night grass of the
local public school, I ached too for
more.
For how our precious little human lives
were supposed to feel full color
beyond a quiet town.
My life has always been a search for this
realness.
In no small part because I have had the
comfort, the education, and the leisure
time to drape myself across a soft pastoral
fantasy.
Staring up at the authentic question of a
rising moon.
What's it like out there?
A local girl asks of Pleasantville's
protagonist after finding out that he is
from the mythical world beyond their cul-de-sacs.
Well, it's louder and scarier, I guess, he
tells her.
And a lot more dangerous.
Sounds fantastic, she replies, and looks in
wonder over the black and white horizon.
This was American Hysteria.
Next time on the show, we're extending the idea of
suburbia out even further and taking a look at those
discontented teenagers we now call hipsters.
And it traces back all the way to a skinny jeans-wearing
Yankee doodle dandy.
The nonprofit we'd like to highlight for this episode is
called Preservation of Affordable Housing.
And their primary mission is to preserve, create, and
sustain affordable, healthy homes that support economic
security and access to opportunity for all.
Their mission is now expanding out into the suburbs to help
those living in hidden poverty.
