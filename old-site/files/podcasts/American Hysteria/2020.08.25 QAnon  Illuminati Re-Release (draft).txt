Hey everyone, over our summer break, we're going to be re-releasing some of our old episodes
as they become relevant in the present moment, with a new intro explaining their new context.
The crux of the theory is this belief that you are secretly saving the world from this
satanic cult of pedophiles and cannibals.
Does that sound like something you are behind?
Well, I haven't heard that, but is that supposed to be a bad thing or a good thing?
I mean, you know, if I can help save the world from problems, I'm willing to do it.
I'm willing to put myself out there.
Anyone who listens to our show was likely already attuned to the far-right conspiracy known as QAnon.
And if you weren't before, now that Donald Trump has essentially praised them publicly, you probably are now.
QAnon purports that a deep state network of rich politicians and entertainers and media people
are all members of what else but a pedophilic satanic cult hell-bent on derailing the presidency of Donald Trump.
The one man who is secretly dedicated to bringing down these baby-killing-and-eating,
shipping-container-child-trafficking, hypnotic-cartoonish-horror villains.
QAnon is nothing but the Illuminati and the satanic panic and even a pinch of the gay agenda,
coming back together again in what promises more and more each day to be a reunion for the ages.
It contains a lot of what we covered in our satanic panic series.
If you'll remember, in the 1980s, the theory went that satanic ritual abuse was happening in preschools all over the country.
Stories of classroom sacrifices, of incredibly horrific, graphic sexual abuse,
of children being flown to Mexico to serve as sex slaves,
of children being placed in kiddie pools,
of little sharks with teachers flying around on broomsticks,
and even a factory line of women impregnated,
giving birth so that hundreds of newborn babies could be slaughtered as sacrifices on the spot,
actually leading police to dig up an entire abandoned lot looking for the proof.
And of course, these cults were a network,
and many believed that the leaders could be found at the highest levels of society.
Arrests and long stints in prison would follow for caregivers all over the country,
though a shred of actual evidence was never found.
Even though the satanic panic feels like this forgotten oddity of American history,
we have to remember how mainstream it really got,
with Oprah and Geraldo doing specials on their shows and inviting victims on,
with the mainstream media pushing these narratives,
with police all over the country being trained in satanic ritual abuse,
with thousands of people recovering memories,
with therapists of satanic ritual abuse from their own childhoods,
and even with the highly publicized McMartin preschool trial
that would turn out to be the most expensive in American history.
And now, like the satanic panic, QAnon is slowly seeping into the mainstream.
The far right has connected these baseless theories of satanic elite child trafficking and abuse
into a political movement,
and many will say that the 1980s were just one big cover-up.
In addition to bringing back the satanic panic,
QAnon is also the Illuminati of 2020,
a secret society of the powerful who are not only systemically abusing kids,
but also destroying the white race,
the good patriots of America,
who are the real disenfranchised people.
Enter Donald Trump,
the man that was apparently recruited by high-ranking military generals
to win the presidency and finally break up this global ring
and finally stop them from controlling the media
and brainwashing the masses
into the kind of behavior and politics
that has driven America farther and farther away from its antique greatness.
More and more memes are also spreading now
that include Black Lives Matter
and, in fact, all of the LGBTQ community
as complicit in this leftist nightmare.
Big surprise there.
Check out our episode on the gay agenda
for more on the gay's historic hypnotic cartoons
and indoctrination and their satanic deviance.
But now it's transgender people
in alliance with the Democrats
who are spreading their mental illness across the country
to destroy gender norms
and, of course, the nuclear family.
And other cute stuff, too.
Starting in October of 2017
on where else but a 4chan message board,
someone began posting
who called themselves Q Clearance Patriot
and then just Q,
and this person allegedly had access
to the inner workings of the government.
Around these leaked secrets
formed this entire movement
that slowly sucked in everyone
from anti-vaxxers to UFO enthusiasts.
As it grew,
it took on the same shape as the Illuminati.
There became something for everyone.
Whether your thing is a COVID hoax
or a COVID cure
or a vaccine only in place to control your mind,
or if your thing is satanic aliens
controlling the bodies of America's elite,
QAnon might be for you.
You can even mash in some JFK conspiracies
with some good old 9-11 truth,
and somehow it all makes sense.
Not only that,
but one of the most widespread beliefs of QAnon
is that these satanic agents
also drink the blood of their victims
so they can consume a fountain of youth chemical
to probably live forever.
But to be fair,
they are kind of right about this.
As we covered in our death episode,
there are billionaires
who are trying to learn about
how to stay young using young people's blood.
So I will give them that.
QAnon is also steeped in white nationalist
and white supremacist thought,
just as the story of the Illuminati
has always, always been.
They have their very own
rich liberal Jewish ringleader,
George Soros,
just as the anti-Semitic Illuminati conspiracies
had their Rothschild,
that man who oversees
the powerful Jewish collusion
in politics,
the media,
and entertainment.
As a reminder,
these accusations
of an international Jewish cabal
controlling the world
were a big part
of the American eugenics movement,
and they all started
through this wholly fictional account
of Jewish leaders and bankers
plotting their world domination
called the Protocols of the Elders of Zion,
which was spread by
American darling Henry Ford
in the 1920s.
Ford would go on
to be the only American praised
in Hitler's Mein Kampf,
and the man featured
in a life-sized portrait
beside his desk.
This Jewish conspiracy theory
would help propel Hitler
to power in a genocide
against not only
what he considered
inferior bloodlines,
but also this dangerous threat
of a secret society
of brutal, evil beings
that would set up the Nazis
as the victims
of this story.
Keeping in mind
Ford's obsession
with superior bloodlines,
here's a Trump clip
from a speech
at a Ford plant
that leveled me.
The company founded
by a man named
Henry Ford,
good bloodlines,
good bloodlines.
You believe in that stuff?
You got good blood.
The FBI has gone as far
as to label QAnon
a terrorist threat
due to the fact
that they have connections
to the man that shot up
a pizza parlor in D.C.
while going on
a vigilante mission
to expose
the child sex trafficking ring
that Hillary Clinton
and John Podesta
were running out
of the basement,
a 2016 conspiracy theory
known as Pizzagate.
It's all super bonked,
of course,
but a growing number
of Americans
disagree with that
and some estimate
that QAnon followers
are into the millions
with many offshoot
Facebook groups
boasting over
100,000 members
with Twitter now
limiting the reach
of over 150,000
QAnon accounts.
Not only that,
but when Georgia
Republican candidate
Marjorie Taylor Greene
won her primary,
a woman who'd been
extremely public
about her belief in Q
and her love
of assault rifles,
the nation glimpsed
a future Republican star,
as Trump put it,
we started to see
that QAnon
was going to be
a more serious problem
than even I ever thought
and this is my actual job.
QAnon is spreading
into the highest levels
of government
and Trump loves them
because they love him
because in their eyes
he is a beefed out,
moralistic,
white Christian hero
here to save the star
of most of our moral panics,
the children.
child trafficking,
which is far less common
and far less sensational
than the satanic panic
and now QAnon
would like us to believe,
phone lines are still
clogged up
with these QAnoners
reporting kids
being shipped
in Wayfair
furniture boxes
and reporting
Hasbro
for grooming
millions of children
to become sex slaves
for powerful men
and women
through the way
they produce their dolls.
We recently re-released
our episode
on satanic ritual abuse
called
Satanic Panic Part 2
and it included
a summary
of this thing
called
Hashtag Wayfairgate
as it's come to be known
and its connection
to these 1980s
satanic theories.
This week
we wanted to re-release
our Illuminati episode
that is a very
important supplement
what has set
the framework
for all American
conspiracy theories,
the story of
the ultimate conspiracy,
the rich and powerful
elite and their secret
sensational horrific sins,
ones that have
always distracted us
from the mundane reason
that our lives
feel out of control
due to the often
harmful decisions
of politicians
on both sides
of the spectrum.
As we explain
in the following episode,
conspiracy theories
give us a sense
of power
over what is
a chaotic country
and a chaotic existence
where so much
is out of our control.
If there is indeed
a network of evil
rich people
eating children,
well, there you go.
There's your simplistic
group of villains
to fight against.
A tangible group
that's committing
the gravest of transgressions
against our most
precious beings.
A group so easy to hate.
A group that can
conveniently link
anyone in.
Political opponents
and liberal celebrities,
masked Antifa
and Black Lives Matter
protesters,
queers of all stripes,
violent minorities,
scientists trying
to prevent
more COVID-19 deaths,
medical doctors
at large
pushing dangerous
vaccines,
big pharma,
the liberal
lying media,
and probably
definitely me.
QAnon spreads
fake news
and accuses anything
that combats it
as fake news
and propaganda.
It's a catch-all
for anything
that they hate,
anything that makes
them angry,
anything that challenges
their reality
or takes them
out of their own
comfort zone.
But hey,
before we start
feeling all high
and mighty,
we all do this.
We all want
the pain to make sense.
We all want
the chaos to make sense.
We all want
there to be order.
And some of us
choose an order
as terrifying
as pedophilic
elite satanic cults.
As long as
there's a hope
to defeat it.
I think it's true,
too,
that as much of America
does in fact
try to bring down
the Trump administration
for reasons
unrelated to
child sex rings,
the president
also acts
as a kind of
psychic dumping
ground for those
on the left.
The concentrated
belief that if he
goes,
America can be
great again
as Biden and
Harris promised
that we will
build back better.
I hope that we
can,
and I hope that
we do,
but if and when
Trump's finally
out of office,
there will still
be an incredible
amount of work
to be done
on a small,
far more boring
scale than
combating a rising
fascist regime
or an elite
satanic cult.
And that's
always the thing.
Once you take away
the simplistic,
sensational fight,
you're left with
a million broken,
boring pieces.
A world so
desperately complicated
that we can be
frozen into
inaction.
It's always been
this way.
QAnon is just
the new alt-right
structure for the
Illuminati seeping
into the mainstream.
As you'll hear in
this next episode,
there was a time
that I,
myself,
was an Illuminati
truther.
That is,
until I found
its ugly,
terrifying heart
in what this
recycled story
has for more
than 300 years
inspired its
believers to do.
The Illuminati
tried to hide
this heart of
darkness,
and it became
a kind of joke
eventually,
sucking in everyone
from Beyonce
to Jay-Z
to Justin Bieber
to Katy Perry
to Lady Gaga
to Obama
and so many more.
For a while,
it's all fun
and games,
making fun
of these stories
of reptilians
inhabiting the
bodies of celebrities.
That is,
until it rises
into a serious
political movement,
one that feels
ready to explode.
Now here it is,
a re-release
of our episode
called
The Illuminati.
On this season,
we'll be exploring
the moral panics,
urban legends,
and conspiracy theories
that shape our
psychology and culture
and why we end
up believing them.
I'm your host,
Chelsea Weber-Smith,
and this is
American Hysteria.
Is this really
a woman that you're
looking at,
or is it all
an illusion?
Because what are
they giving birth to?
The new world order
satanic raid.
Protocols of Zionism
designed to give
the synagogue of Satan
ultimate world domination.
The public's finally
waking up to the fact
that Hillary Clinton's
a reptilian shapeshifter.
So I'm definitely
interested to see
where this new election
goes.
My first real introduction
to the Illuminati
and their new world order
came when I was a freshman
in college in 2007
by a movie suggestion
from my dad,
who always had
a new conspiracy theory
to share with me.
Zeitgeist was one
of the first movies
you could get streaming
online for free,
which made it feel
noble,
like someone was
finally doing something
not just for the money.
At first,
it seemed to be
a hip critique of religion,
of the government,
of the rich,
you know,
all the good stuff.
And it felt easy
to believe
against the background
of Bush's presidency,
of the remaining
unanswered questions
from 9-11,
and the misleading reasons
for a war in Iraq
that I was actively
protesting against.
I just sort of accepted
the Illuminati
as secret fact.
But the thing
I didn't know
at the time,
the thing I didn't know
until years later,
was that the movie
Zeitgeist
and the ones
that came after it
completely rebranded
the Illuminati conspiracy.
The idea
that a global cabal
of elite rulers
control and manipulate
world events
has actually always been
a serious American fear.
Eventually,
I started to see
these little hints
of a scarier side
to this conspiracy
that I was known
to chatter on about,
half joking,
but also,
if I'm being honest,
half serious.
I felt the need
to do a deeper dive
into the origins
of this story.
And when I did,
I found a confusing mess
of anti-Semitism,
New Age mysticism,
Christian extremism,
radical right-wing
militia propaganda,
and ufology,
that is,
the study of UFOs.
What I found was,
at times,
hilarious,
and at other times,
deeply alarming.
I wondered how we got here,
to 2018,
when in formation,
our most mega
of mega-celebrities sings,
y'all haters corny
with that Illuminati mess.
Beyonce,
who was accused,
among other things,
of naming her daughter
Blue Ivy
as an acronym
for Born Living Under Evil,
Illuminati's very youngest.
For this episode,
I'll explore the progression
of the Illuminati story,
along with its effects,
and try to understand
why some people,
including me,
are more prone
to believing than others,
and also,
how this seemingly silly story
has emboldened people
throughout history
to do some unimaginably
terrible things.
This is the mother
of all conspiracy theories.
Every other conspiracy theory
can be entered
into its folds.
Any evidence against them
is seen as planted
or forged,
purposeful misdirection,
as propaganda
of the state
or of Satan.
In fact,
this very podcast episode
could be accused
of being that very kind
of propaganda,
paid for by the Rothschild family,
with yours truly
as their mind-control puppet,
a bona fide member
of the Illuminati itself.
You'll find me sitting
underground with Beyonce
and Jay-Z
on a throne made of bones,
holding an occultic
golden chalice,
drinking bright red
American blood.
First things first,
let's start with a story
from the time I believed.
I was moving from
Port Towns in Washington
down to the Bay Area,
and I thought it would be fun
to take a road trip with you,
and you were living in Seattle, so...
So I'm talking to my friend
Austin Smith here.
We went to graduate school
together at the University
of Virginia in Charlottesville.
Invited you to come along,
and I don't remember
too many of the places
we stayed north of San Francisco
until we arrived
in the little town
of Guerneville,
which is deep in the Redwoods,
pretty close to the coast,
and somehow or other
we ended up in this
kind of interesting campground
that was also, it seemed,
more of a permanent residence.
For some people,
there were trailers,
and people were kind of
camped out there
for the long haul,
and we stayed there
a few nights.
I also have a cousin
named Colin,
who at the time,
maybe a year or so
before this trip
that we took,
he had kind of gone
through some changes,
including a name change.
He was going by the name
Tree Music at the time.
My cousin Alex and I,
this was Colin's brother.
We went with Colin,
a.k.a. Tree Music,
to this weird festival
about two hours
north of San Francisco.
I think it was called
Soul Fest,
and Colin and Alex
got into an argument,
and this argument involved
a claim that Colin
slash Tree Music
was making about
the Illuminati.
He was telling us
that there was this camp
north of San Francisco,
I believe he even
called it Bohemian Grove,
where very powerful people
would gather once a year,
and he claimed that
Donald Rumsfeld
came to this event
every year,
and that there was
this massive wooden owl
set back in the redwoods
that these people
would pray to.
I guess pray is probably
the wrong word.
Worship in some way.
And Alex thought that
this was completely insane,
and so I was just kind of
sitting in the middle
of that argument,
and I don't recall
which side of it
I fell on,
but I remember thinking
if Donald Rumsfeld
is worshipping
a 40-foot tall
wooden owl
in the redwoods,
you know,
that's actually kind of,
that's actually kind of
interesting,
and maybe even
a little bit cool,
and I kind of wanted
it to be true.
Well, and then I remember you,
because I also met
Colin slash Tree Music
on that trip,
there was conversation
around the stone owl then.
I think it was stone,
but I don't know.
My fault, stone,
that's right.
All right, Austin,
get it right.
So when we got to this place,
we were talking to these people,
and suddenly they're telling us
these stories about how they all
work at Bohemian Grove,
and I remember at that moment
I like shot you a look
across this fire that we were at,
and it was this like
generations of families
that had worked at
Bohemian Grove,
and it was a son
and a mother,
and they were saying things like,
I remember someone saying like,
yeah, Henry Kissinger
loves the salsa I made.
I remember that too.
And then the other guy
was saying,
yeah, they put on these robes
and they worship a stone owl,
and it's a play they put on.
They're just really weird.
Like, they're just
really quirky rich people.
They just put on this play
where they pretend
to sacrifice something,
and I am just sitting there,
like, looking at you like,
this is my,
this is firsthand evidence
that this is true.
The mom said,
oh yeah, I can't be there past noon
because that's when
the men go underground.
And because I had just met
Tree Music
and had talked to him at length
about the Illuminati,
and especially the stone owl
and Bohemian Grove
and these specifics of the story,
I was, you know,
before I was kind of like,
you know, Chelsea, come on.
Like, this isn't real
and you know it.
It's so silly.
And then it's one of those moments
where something just clicks into place
and you're like,
oh my God,
is this really,
is this really true?
And that night,
I definitely went to bed
just and stared up
at the stars
from my sleeping bag,
which is like,
oh man.
Like, okay,
so Bohemian Grove exists.
There's this huge stone owl
in the woods.
Well, what do you do about that?
I mean,
it's something to fixate upon
and it gives us
a tangible image
that of something,
of an issue
that is otherwise intangible.
And I think that's why
we're drawn to it,
perhaps, you know.
Don't get me wrong here.
Bohemian Grove is a real place,
a men's only club
for the most powerful
in the world.
And they do put on
a dramatic play
created by the owners
of the club
called The Cremation of Care,
a ritual to revere
the Redwoods
with a huge bonfire
by the giant stone owl
and a play that appears
as a sacrifice.
They also drink heavily,
smoke countless cigars
in the dry forest,
don creepy costumes,
and make actual
political and business
decisions while they are there.
Basically,
it's a frat boy
secret society
two-week binge party
that actually may decide
some of our future.
I won't deny that.
And I won't deny
that politicians,
CEOs,
and celebrities
can do harmful things
and are shielded
from consequences
by their power.
But that's not
what the Illuminati theory
is saying.
I think we'd better start
at the beginning.
On May 1st, 1776,
a Bavarian law professor
named Adam Weishaupt
formed a group
called the Order
of Illuminists.
At the time,
he couldn't afford
the membership fee
to join the Freemasons,
so Weishaupt hoped
to create his own
secular, rationalist
organization
similar to the Freemasons
with a goal
of freeing all societies
of the world
from established
religious and political
authority.
After gaining 2,500 members
and lasting only
11 or 12 years,
the organization
was dissolved
when secret societies
were made illegal
in Bavaria.
And that might have
been the end of it.
But 20 years later,
a Scottish physicist
named John Robeson
published Proofs
of a Conspiracy
Against All the Religions
and Governments of Europe
Carried on in the Secret
Meetings of Freemasons,
Illuminati,
and Reading Societies,
which spread rumors
that the Order of Illuminists
and the Freemasons
were the puppet masters
behind the French Revolution.
Robeson wrote
that the Illuminati
were hell-bent
on destroying religion
and that the members
had done things
like create a tea
that caused abortions
and could blind or kill
when squirted
in the face of an enemy.
The rumors soon
crossed the ocean,
landing mainly
on American religious pulpits,
with the rationalist
founding fathers
becoming suspect
for their participation
in the Freemasons'
secret societies.
And the splinters
the fears caused
led to America's
first official third party,
the Anti-Masonic Party,
as well as rumors
lasting to this day
that the founding fathers
added secret symbols
and messages in plain sight,
like on our money.
Then in 1921,
two writers
named Nesta Webster
and Edith Starr Miller
added a new deadly feature
to the Illuminati lore.
Both were serious
fangirls of fascism,
both very anti-Semitic,
and together
they helped popularize
the 1901 Protocols
of the Elders of Zion,
a thoroughly debunked
fabrication
of the alleged minutes
from a late 19th century meeting
in which Jewish leaders
of a powerful secret cabal
plan their world domination
through gaining control
of the press and economy.
That same year,
researchers found
that the book
was made up
of plagiarized statements
from two different
fictional sources.
But then,
THE Henry Ford
had 500,000 copies
of the Protocols
of the Elders of Zion
printed and distributed
throughout the U.S.,
along with a ton
of other anti-Semitic works.
Henry Ford
was well-liked by Hitler,
so much so
that he was the only
American name
found in his memoir,
Mein Kampf,
and a life-sized
framed portrait
of Ford
hung beside Hitler's desk.
I really want
to drive home
how influential
this forged text
has truly been.
Hitler read the Protocols
in the 1920s
and referred to it
many times
in his early speeches.
Without the idea
that came from the Protocols,
the idea that Jews
were controlling the world
with evil intentions,
the Nazis may have
had a more difficult time
turning them
into their own folk devil,
that is,
their scapegoat,
to justify
the horrors
they committed.
Right after World War II,
accusations were leveled
against the Rothschild family,
who had long been famous
for being both rich
and Jewish,
that they successfully
faked some
or even all
of the Holocaust
in order to create
a lasting sympathy
toward Jewish people,
making their eventual
world domination
that much easier.
It is a big idea,
a new world order,
where diverse nations
are drawn together
in common cause
to achieve
the universal aspirations
of mankind,
peace and security,
freedom,
and the rule of law.
That 1991 speech
by George Bush Sr.
at the end of the Cold War
contained a buzzword
that would propel
the Illuminati myth
even farther
into the public eye,
the new world order.
Televangelist Pat Robertson
helped the Illuminati
become a sort of
catch-all term
in the early 90s
when he and other
TV preachers
began popularizing
the new world order
as a good versus evil
spiritual battle
that had been raging
since the Garden of Eden.
Let's hear a little excerpt
from Pat Robertson's book,
New World Order.
Such a world government
can come together
only after
the Christian
United States
is out of the way.
After all,
a vital,
economically strong,
Christian
United States
would have at its disposal
the spiritual
and material force
to prohibit
a worldwide
satanic dictator
from winning
his battle.
Televangelists
sloppily scrubbed
the conspiracy clean
of its anti-Semitism
while at the same time
using Nesta Webster's
writing as their
main inspiration.
They repurposed
the protocols
of the elders of Zion
saying that the only
part of the document
that was fake
was the part about
the Jews being
the ones in charge.
They said the Illuminati
just put in that bit
about Jews
to throw off the scent.
Following the occult ideas
that also appeared
constantly in Nesta Webster's
writing,
they claimed that
the Illuminati
was in cahoots
with the Antichrist
and that they used
rituals, symbols
and other forms
of dark magic
to influence the population
and subvert
the teachings of Jesus.
Think of the New World Order
as the Illuminati's
world domination plan,
a one-world government
and religion
controlled by an elite few
with an eventual goal
of mass imprisonment
of the population
using such groups
as the United Nations
to manipulate world events
for their benefit.
They create disasters
to disrupt
and disarm the public
so that they can
suspend the Constitution
and then impose martial law
using an army
of foreign U.N. peacekeepers,
detain detractors,
and tattoo a number
on every person
that they can use
to purchase goods.
If it seemed like war yesterday,
the reinforcements
showed up tonight.
At the center of it all,
of course,
is the bombed-out shell
of the federal office building
and in its shadow
the exhausted
who for a day and a half now
have sifted through its debris
and counted its dead
and seen up close
why they call it terror.
In 1995,
Oklahoma City bomber
Timothy McVeigh's truck bomb
killed 168 people
and wounded more than 680 others
in one of the worst
domestic terrorist attacks
in U.S. history.
McVeigh was looking for revenge
against the federal government,
believing that during
their messy raid
of the Waco compound,
they had targeted
and murdered
cult leader David Koresh
and the Branch Davidians
for one single reason,
that they were
stockpiling firearms.
But what did McVeigh
and those like him
believe would happen
after the patriots
were disarmed?
Something called
FEMA death camps.
That is,
U.S. concentration camps
set up after a fake disaster
manufactured by the Illuminati.
The Federal Emergency
Management Agency
would imprison
so-called patriots
under the guise
of disaster relief
and then eventually kill them
for population control.
Timothy McVeigh
and others like him
in the growing militia movement
were almost certainly
emboldened by the protocols
by Nesta Webster
and Henry Ford.
McVeigh was certainly
influenced by a disturbing
novel called
The Turner Diaries,
a book about a violent
overthrow of the United States,
which is controlled
by a Jewish cabal,
and the subsequent
extermination of Jews,
gay people,
and non-whites.
These ideas made it
into tons of pamphlets
that were disseminated
at gun shows,
fanning the paranoid flames
of people who could be
like Timothy McVeigh,
setting up a nebulous enemy,
a threat to fight against.
They reveled in the denial
of the existence
of real,
historically proven
concentration camps
and raged against
alleged fake
future concentration camps
that would see them
as the primary victims.
But there was another,
even more outlandish,
story being told.
The famous ufologist
Bill Cooper's
Behold a Pale Horse,
another favorite
in militia circles,
told Americans
that both aliens
and the Illuminati
had signed a treaty
in 1954
with Dwight D. Eisenhower
and had been in power
on Earth ever since.
And then David Icke,
a popular BBC sports reporter,
really brought
the New World Order
out of the fundamentalist
right wing
and into the New Age,
and he created
a non-Christian template
for other types of people
to enter into the conspiracy.
Putting things
in terms of energy
rather than in strict
biblical terms,
his book
The Biggest Secret
also expanded Cooper's
alien theory
for the same
alternative crowd.
The book says
that these aliens
that he calls reptilians
live both in outer space
and on Earth
inside underground tunnels
and caverns.
He says it may be difficult
at first to identify
one of these reptilians
as they have bred
with humans over time,
giving them the look
of a humanoid.
And through selective mating,
they interbreed
to keep the bloodlines
thriving and in power.
These reptilians
can also shapeshift
and travel
into different dimensions
and can only be defeated
by our collective
human enlightenment,
some kind of leveling up
of consciousness.
When I look at these people,
which I would say
are absolutely reptilian,
people like Tony Blair
and Clinton,
Barack Obama,
no matter what their face
is doing,
smiling,
happy, slappy,
their eyes don't change.
At the same time,
references to the Illuminati
also reach
a totally different world,
the emerging hip-hop labels
on the West and East Coasts.
As the genre exploded
in popularity,
artists began including
lyrical mentions
about the Illuminati
starting in 1995
with LL Cool J's
I Shot Ya,
where he says,
Illuminati want my mind,
soul, and body.
And soon,
AZ,
the Wu-Tang Clan,
Dr. Dre,
and others began following suit,
and the trend really caught on.
But paranoiacs
outside the hip-hop world
believe that these were hints
that the new genre
had been infiltrated,
and its artists
were now under elite control.
Even now,
Jay-Z's label
Rock Nation's
infamous hand sign,
the holding together
of both hands
to form a triangle,
is said to be a nod
to the Illuminati's
favorite symbol,
the Eye of Providence,
that pyramid
with the eye on top of it
you see on the dollar bill,
the same one
allegedly planted there
by the Freemason
founding fathers,
representing the all-seeing eye
of the Illuminati.
And now celebrities too,
and most especially
successful black celebrities,
were seen,
and still are,
as a dangerous
and lasting part
of the New World Order,
prepared to hypnotize
the nation away
from Christ's message
in occult music videos
and performance rituals.
Bolstered by the work
of televangelists
and fundamentalist
conspiracy theorists
dating back to Nesta Webster,
the Illuminati
became loaded most heavily
with associations
to the occult,
which linked it easily
to paganism
and Egyptian symbolism
and satanic mysticism,
elements to this day
that are seen by theorists
in almost every single thing
that any popular celebrity
ever does.
For example,
the covering of one eye
is yet another shout-out
to that same eye of Providence.
As the internet became commonplace
and anyone could add
their two cents
to the conspiracy,
all these ideas,
ideas of elite Jews,
of reptilian aliens,
of the Antichrist
and the occult,
of false flag shootings
and fake disasters,
of celebrity satanic rituals
mixed together
and cross-pollinated
and mutated
into its own kind
of complicated religion.
I'll cover some of them now,
just let me get ready.
Ahem.
Ahem.
9-11 was a false flag
by our government
to create a panic
that only the government
could solve
by eroding more
of our freedoms.
GMOs are being manufactured
by the government
and evil corporations.
They're breeding out
the nutrients,
causing massive deaths
for malnutrition.
Fluoride added to topwater
is used to dumb down
the masses,
making them easier
to control and manipulate.
Chemtrails following jets
are chemical
and mind-control weather plots
by the Rothschild family.
Every school shooting
dating back to Columbine
is a false flag operation
by the Illuminati
designed to pass
stricter gun laws
and disarm the public.
The government
is pumping chemicals
into the water supply
to make people gay
in order to help
keep the population numbers down.
George Bush's grandma
may have gotten pregnant
in a sex magic orgy
with famous occultist
Aleister Crowley,
known then as the Beast,
making Bush
a direct descendant
and possibly the Antichrist.
Barack Obama
is an actual demon
who smells like sulfur
in person
and who is organizing
troops made out of
black and brown youth gangs
who will carry out
his New World Order.
Beyoncé's Rocca Nation
hand sign during
the 2013 Super Bowl
was a signal
that the New World Order
takeover is imminent
any day now.
JonBenet Ramsey
was kidnapped
by the Illuminati
and replaced with
mind-control puppet
Katy Perry.
Hillary Clinton
and John Podesta
are running a satanic
child sex trafficking ring
out of a DC pizza parlor
and arcade.
It's time to wake up,
sheeple.
It's time to open
your eyes
and know that
you have been lied to.
What will you do
when the New World Order
comes?
So let's start here.
Why are some people,
including me,
more prone to believing
in conspiracy theories
like this one?
Some psychologists
believe that these myths
express the human need
for control,
that the Illuminati theory
acts as a kind
of coping mechanism.
Because as strange
as it might be,
it can actually be
more comforting
to believe in an
impossibly complex
evil system of control
over everything
than to face the possibility
that everything bad
that happens
might be random,
indifferent,
meaningless chaos.
As complicated
as these interwoven parts
of the conspiracy theory
may seem,
they are nonetheless
a method of simplification.
The Illuminati
lets us believe
that the past,
present,
and future are fixed,
that at least someone
or something
is in control
of our earthly fate
and thus can be defeated
in an easier way.
Because the battle
is against one single
evil entity
rather than against
a million smaller ones,
the vast broken systems,
corrupt individuals,
inefficient,
and unjust laws.
Maybe the idea
that reptilian aliens
control the government
is simply another metaphor,
this time for the anxiety
we feel when we experience
the control of a group
that often does not
have our best interests
at heart.
Saying the government
is acting selfishly,
violently,
and secretly
just doesn't express
how scary
that powerlessness
truly feels.
You know what kind of does,
though?
Cold-blooded,
emotionless,
reptilian aliens.
Having this secret knowledge
also makes people feel special.
It made me feel kind of special.
And secret knowledge
can mimic that feeling of power.
And so creating a narrative
where you're a valiant superhero
fighting to the death
against an ancient league
of all-powerful supervillains,
it's an attractive choice to make.
Scientists and psychologists
also point to a mental shortcut
known as pattern perception.
We all have an automatic system
in place inside our brains
that attempts to recognize patterns
so that we can predict future events
and keep ourselves safe.
Patterns of color
to recognize what's safe to eat,
facial patterns
to help us identify
what others are feeling,
and language patterns
to help us communicate.
But some folks have
what's called
illusory pattern perception.
Basically,
the mental shortcut
turned up to 11,
and they see patterns
and connections everywhere.
In one experiment,
spotting patterns
in random computer-produced
strings of numbers.
People with this illusory
pattern perception
might see ghosts in darkness,
UFOs in the stars,
or see signs telling them
about their life's true path.
All stuff that at one point
or another
has been true about me,
and some of it's still true.
Of course,
a small group of people
do, in a sense,
control the world,
and since the creation
of government,
this has been
the central struggle,
the knowledge that power
is not evenly distributed,
not even close.
Though the Occupy Wall Street
movement popularized
the term the 1%
during the worldwide protests
that began in 2011,
it's actually more accurate
to mention the 0.01%.
16,000 Americans
have as much money
as 80% of the rest
of the population.
And of course,
this wealth is used
to influence politics.
We are at the mercy
of people in power,
and those in power can,
and at times do,
largely act from their
own self-interest,
with sometimes dire consequences.
All while they do weird,
rich people bullshit
in the woods.
It truly isn't hard
to find evidence
of government
and corporate corruption,
but it's impossible
to find hard evidence
of any kind of
all-encompassing conspiracy
linking all these
separate events together
in a meaningful way.
In fact,
the conspiracy theory
gives way too much credit
to those in power,
that they could successfully
orchestrate
fake natural disasters
and school shootings,
create mind-control technology,
convene successfully
with demons
and Satan himself
to bolster
ancient spiritual power,
all while keeping
everything secret,
hiding all the evidence,
and teasing us
with secret signals
in pop songs.
They're just not that smart.
But the layering
of these conspiracy works
that say otherwise
create a kind of canon,
that is,
a collection of sacred texts
that build on one another,
making reference only
to the fabricated works
that came before,
which make references
to the ones that came
before that,
until it appears
as hundreds of footnotes
of evidence,
making it look legitimate
enough to believe.
And now,
here we are in 2018.
You can buy tights
from Hot Topic
printed with the all-seeing eye.
Moms know all about
the Illuminati
from reading Dan Brown's books
like Angels and Demons
that reinvigorated
the suspicions
of Freemasons
and the Founding Fathers,
and now they eye
Masonic lodges
as they pass them
in their minivans.
Just last year,
famous country singer
Charlie Daniels
of The Devil Went Down
to Georgia fame,
who shares conspiracy theories
on a regular basis,
tweeted in response
to Taco Bell's new
Bell-Luminati commercial,
Hey Taco Bell,
the Illuminati
is not a frivolous subject.
To most of us,
the Illuminati
has become a meme,
a running joke,
a punchline,
but it's also continued
to inspire those
who have more trouble
discerning fact from fiction,
those who may already have
an old folk devil in mind.
With the tragedy
at Charlottesville's
Unite the Right rally
in 2017,
the hidden antisemitism
of the Illuminati conspiracy
has been revealed again
and has entered back
into the mainstream conversation.
Just last year,
a huge group of neo-Nazis,
many of them young men
bolstered by the same
conspiracy theories
of a Jewish Illuminati,
descended on the park
that once held
Occupy Charlottesville,
a place I spent a lot of time at
in 2011 and 2012
when I was a grad student at UVA.
And now I can look back
and see that the same theories
that once circulated
through the quirkier camps
of Occupy,
that were told to me
late at night
around a fire burning
on a portable iron fire pit
about a global conspiracy
of CEOs and politicians
that had been running
the show since the beginning,
had also been circulating
in the right-wing militia circles
that came there
to replace us,
only with a different villain,
with one of the oldest
and most common
historical folk devils,
the Jewish people.
At the end of the
Unite the Right rally,
a young self-proclaimed
neo-Nazi
who had been sharing
these Jewish conspiracy theories
on social media,
drove his car through
a crowd of counter-protesters
that included people I knew,
killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer.
It's not hard to see
how these conspiracy theories
directly influenced
the 2016 election,
a time when the general public's
desire for an anti-establishment
candidate burned hot.
In 2013,
polls showed that 23%
of voters believed
in the existence
of a secret group
that had a globalist agenda
and was attempting
to rule the world
through an authoritarian government.
And now,
we have a president
in office
that frequently uses
these theories,
ones about a deep
state conspiracy
against him
run by George Soros,
who also pays protesters
who come out
against his policies.
Democratic donor Soros,
a liberal Jew,
has all but become
the new Rothschild,
accused of paying
migrant workers
crossing the border,
of creating fake disasters
and school shootings,
of controlling the weather.
During the recording
of this episode,
a man opened fire
in the Tree of Life synagogue,
killing 11 people
in the worst
anti-Semitic crime
in American history.
In addition,
hate crimes
against Jewish people
rose 57%
between 2016 and 2017.
I think we need
to understand
that there's a narrative
that we may not be hearing,
but one that's
nonetheless being told,
one that has affected
our past devastatingly,
as well as our present,
from the Holocaust
to the Oklahoma bombing
to Charlottesville
and now to the
Tree of Life shooting.
The man responsible
for the shooting
had shared all of
these same conspiracy theories
on his social media
before the shooting happened.
As he entered the synagogue,
he yelled,
I can't sit by
and watch my people
get slaughtered.
Screw your optics.
I'm going in.
Just because someone
believes in the Illuminati
doesn't mean that they're aware
of its anti-Jewish connotations.
I certainly wasn't.
For a long time,
no one I talked to manically,
none of the weird kindred spirits
I chatted with
about the theories
ever brought up
elite Jews
or the Holocaust.
Until one day,
someone did.
They told me about
the fake Holocaust
and about who
the Illuminati really were.
And they talked to me
like all of this
was obvious.
They assumed
that I was already
on board.
And then,
like,
when you learn a new word
and start hearing it
everywhere,
I began to see
the anti-Semitism
everywhere I looked.
I watched as musician
and reality star
Tila Tequila,
who I was once
very fond of
when she was the star
of the bisexual reality TV show
A Shot at Love.
Don't judge me.
Well,
she went from writing
a bizarre rambling blog
about the New Age fight
against the reptilian overlords
to an essay she wrote
called
Why I Sympathize
with Hitler Part One
to a full-blown photo shoot
of her in a sexy Nazi uniform,
the saturated blue sky
and righteous clouds
beaming in behind her.
I wondered,
what if,
by the time
that true Illuminati believers
uncover the anti-Semitism
at the heart of the theory,
are they already primed
to believe it?
As we saw
with the militia movements
of the 1990s,
the New World Order theory
can empower dangerous people
as the only true victims
of our collective story
and can turn those
who have been systematically oppressed
into the secret villains.
Illuminati theorists
can deem anyone they want
as part of the enemy
because in their own minds,
they themselves
are the hunted ones
and every real hate crime,
every proven tragedy
is nothing but an illusion.
Our world is so complicated
that I often don't know
who the real villains are,
but likely some of them
have gotten drunk
in the woods
of Bohemian Grove.
I do know
who they're not.
A small religious community
gathered quietly
on a Saturday morning,
the group that was accused
by the gunman
as carrying out a genocide
against his people.
His people
being the white race.
Human beings create stories
to justify their violence,
and this conspiracy
has become
an ultimate kind of excuse,
a dramatic,
pretend battle
to live proudly inside of,
one that distracts
devastatingly
from real,
vital issues.
This Illuminati mess
is corny as hell,
as Beyonce
has adequately mentioned,
but, like Charlie Daniels said,
it is not a frivolous subject.
It's something deadly serious,
not because the Illuminati
is real,
but because of what the story
can embolden people to do.
From Skylark,
this was American Hysteria.
Next time on the show,
in a two-part series,
I'll take this fear
of world domination
one step further.
The 1980s and early 90s
saw an extreme phenomenon
known as satanic panic
sweep the U.S.,
the belief that everything
from heavy metal
to Sunday morning cartoons
were indoctrinating the young
into satanic cults,
and that daycare workers
were engaged
in outrageous
satanic ritual abuse
of children
all over the country,
leading to the longest
and most expensive trial
in American history.
Part one is coming
in two weeks.
American Hysteria
is written and produced
by me,
Chelsea Weber-Smith.
Assistant produced
by Derek Smith,
produced and edited
by Clear Camo Studios,
voice acting by Will Rogers,
and thanks to my guest,
Austin Smith.
