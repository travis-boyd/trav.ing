0.00 19.66 SPEAKER_01  Welcome back to Western Kabuki. My name is Caleb. As always, I am joined by my co-hosts,
19.66 20.58 SPEAKER_02  June. How are you doing?
21.36 37.58 SPEAKER_04  I'm great. We're living in the era of Doge. Big time for Doge, big time for government shutdowns. It's wonderful. Oh God, I cannot wait every day just to wake up and see what horrors await us. I'm so excited. This is everything I've always wanted.
40.10 54.04 SPEAKER_04  Yeah. Alex? I don't have anything funny to rip on. Every time I look at my phone, I just feel worse. Everything is real bad. Things are bad. Yeah, sorry to start this off with like, yeah, things fucking suck.
54.04 57.34 SPEAKER_02  I'll be real. Every time you do something like that, I usually have a quick little retort.
57.34 66.60 SPEAKER_02  I'm tired. All my holiday stuff is already done. I just got home and I'm just, yeah, everything is bad. I wish I was funnier. Sorry. Alex, how are you doing, pal?
67.50 71.78 SPEAKER_03  Well, I am in a bathroom in Vancouver recording this.
72.78 74.46 SPEAKER_03  Let's get the tour of the setup, please.
74.56 80.76 SPEAKER_03  Okay, here we go. So there's the, that's a blanket I've hung on the shower door so that it's- Very nifty.
81.12 81.32 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
81.32 81.72 SPEAKER_04  Beautiful.
81.72 96.18 SPEAKER_03  I moved like a little stool from like a sitting area in here. So I'm right next to the toilet and I've got my computer on a garbage can. And I'm just, I'm just facing the corner like the end of the Blair Witch Project.
96.72 100.00 SPEAKER_03  Trying to get as little reverberation going as possible.
100.68 103.62 SPEAKER_02  Ladies and gentlemen, that's your Patreon dollars at work right there.
103.62 109.14 SPEAKER_04  This is how hard it is to be a podcaster. This is what we go through. This is the torture.
109.44 112.10 SPEAKER_03  Podcasting is art. And you know what? We suffer for this.
112.10 122.12 SPEAKER_02  This week we're joined by a very special guest, Megan Romer, who is one of the, you said co-chairs is the title.
122.40 122.62 SPEAKER_00  Yep.
122.94 126.64 SPEAKER_02  Of National Democratic Socialists of America. How are you doing?
127.08 128.02 SPEAKER_00  I'm doing well. How are you?
128.44 129.66 SPEAKER_04  Thank you so much for joining us.
129.80 130.92 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, thanks for having me.
131.56 157.48 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, no, this is kind of like a, I mean, I'm sure pretty much everyone that's not like a psychopath is kind of in the position right now where it's like, we wish, like, we wish we, the world wasn't going the way it was going. But what better time than to like recalibrate like strategy and kind of like take, like look inward and be like, what's like, what are we doing? What should we do? Like, what can we change? What kind of new things should we do?
157.74 224.68 SPEAKER_04  And I, you know, people always have like complaints about DSA. I'm sure people in DSA are very acutely aware of like discourse about DSA. But I think, you know, it's one of the bigger organizations, leftist organizations out there that exists that actually has some sort of intention of a plan. So I guess right away, what, so like DSA has kind of gotten in the spotlight since 2016, but more specifically, I think when like AOC kind of got involved with it and, you know, the whole Bernie wave too. But that's, what's, what's been like the shift from like the 2020 to like 2024? Like, cause obviously something needs to change with politics as I kind of brought up right away. Like the richest man in the world is basically president right now and going to be controlling everything. And like, this can't continue to happen. So I guess what I'm really curious about is like, what's the, like, I don't know if this is even right on the top of the episode, June is asking you to solve politics. Yeah. Yeah. How do we solve politics? What's the DSA like mindset right now? What's the like leftist organizer mindset right now?
225.22 255.18 SPEAKER_00  Yeah. I mean, it's, it's a weird and hard time to be a socialist for sure. But it's also the time when it has become clear that like an actual organized, you know, fierce fighting strong leftist movement is the, as important as because, you know, liberal democracy will not save us, unfortunately. Um, Nope. If it was going to, it would have, uh, but all it does is sort of, I don't even want to say kick the can down the road. It like sort of trips on the can and the
255.18 261.30 SPEAKER_04  can rolls a little bit. And then the can, the can clearly has dementia and no one wants to talk
261.30 267.40 SPEAKER_00  about it. And then they throw a party for the can from the can somehow. It's very uncomfortable.
267.40 313.68 SPEAKER_02  Um, very bad. See the, um, the influencer party, by the way, did you guys see the pictures from the influencer party? Like the holiday? Oh my God. So it's like all of the sort of lefty Twitter people who paid to post all. So if you, the listener have not heard this, uh, or seen this, first of all, I'm sorry for bringing this to your attention, but they did do, um, I guess, I don't know. They're, they're putting Joe Biden on the ice flow kind of party and shoving them off to see, I don't know what the, what the point of this party was, but there's all the people that you yell at on Twitter. We're all there. You got Jojo from jurors, molar. She wrote, uh, the Brooklyn dad defiant, uh, just, yeah, just everybody, everyone's favorites.
314.68 318.94 SPEAKER_02  And they were all, they all took selfies with Hunter Biden.
318.94 323.96 SPEAKER_02  Okay. And posted selfies with Hunter Biden right after he was pardoned.
324.02 333.88 SPEAKER_04  In their defense, if I was at a party with Hunter Biden, I would also like do that too. I would absolutely take a picture with Hunter Biden. So like that's to me, that's the least.
334.30 335.42 SPEAKER_02  There would be some irony for that, right? Like.
335.50 337.62 SPEAKER_04  Oh, absolutely. I would, no, there is.
337.76 353.60 SPEAKER_00  I would take a picture with him, but I would make him take his shirt off for a good reason because Hunter Biden has this massive back tattoo of the Finger Lakes, which is where I'm from. It's this and I don't really know why, like I Googled at some point, Hunter Biden Finger Lakes tattoo.
354.18 367.32 SPEAKER_00  It's something like, oh, we have fond family memories of there, but it kind of, cause like I wanted a Finger Lakes tattoo, but now I can't have one cause that's a Hunter Biden tattoo. It's kind of taken, but I would definitely do a shirt off buddy. Come on. I know you want to.
367.98 372.74 SPEAKER_02  Just another thing stolen from the bride Biden crime syndicate, the Finger Lakes tattoo.
372.74 378.18 SPEAKER_00  There's so much matter about this than about almost any other Biden related thing.
378.86 391.90 SPEAKER_02  Yeah. Also, did you guys read the report that he, I guess he was, I don't, I wish I knew more about this. I'm sorry for bringing this up, but he was with some, some woman and they smoked weed and whatever and listened to music. And then I guess they listened to Red Scare.
392.90 394.12 SPEAKER_04  Oh my God. I did.
394.12 401.84 SPEAKER_02  Yeah. I did. I did see that. Honestly, like Hunter Biden listening to Red Scare is worse than the gun charge to me. I agree.
402.72 406.58 SPEAKER_04  That kind of ruins him for me. Like I was kind of on board with, with his whole deal.
407.16 448.06 SPEAKER_04  Red Scare. That's like, it's just a step too far. Honestly, I, I, I agree. Um, but you know, like that party to me, that, that party, whatever that going away, they're sending them off to see, they're doing a Vikings funeral for Joe Biden. Um, that, that party is indicative of, of like so much that's wrong with like the, the, at least I'm, I'm hoping that's the previous era of the democratic party. I'm hoping very naively that they'll change, but like, that's everything that's wrong with them because like, they invite these like influencers that are like handpicked by the party as like, Oh, everyone likes these people. Right. And it's like, no one really does except for people that will always vote for Democrats blindly. You know? Um, I mean, more than anything,
448.06 460.36 SPEAKER_03  you're never going to get any actual progress from a party that is as interested in the entrenched power structures as the democratic party is like, we're just never getting there.
460.36 491.70 SPEAKER_00  Yeah. They're not going to get better. Unfortunately. I mean, I say that with like very, very convinced authority at this point. Um, I've wanted them to get better for my whole adult life. Uh, they don't and won't because you know, they are the party of liberal democracy and liberal democracy is the ideology of capitalism. Um, you know, it's free markets and, uh, freedom of whatever, uh, to, you know, make money and exploit people. Um, it is different from conservatism.
491.84 496.72 SPEAKER_00  It's different from fascism, but it's still in service of capitalism and it's not going to give
496.72 533.58 SPEAKER_04  us liberation. So it's brought us, I would argue, I would argue it's brought us to this moment that we're living in right now too. I mean, like the whole Biden administration led us to this point, uh, and their leadership and everything has kind of, I don't want to say ruined the country. Cause of course, at the end of the day, it is Republicans kind of doing what they're doing, but they led us down this path. The Democrats led us to this point where this was even possible. Yeah. They didn't have to lose. Um, yeah, which is horrific, I guess. Yeah, but they didn't want to, yeah, they didn't
533.58 548.98 SPEAKER_00  want to have to do what they would have to do to win. Right. Like if they actually ran on things like ending the genocide, or if they actually ran on giving people healthcare, um, they would have to do it and they don't want to do that. Um, because it's not what, you know, it's not their ideology.
548.98 584.60 SPEAKER_04  They want a healthcare market. I guess from that and what you mentioned before about how you rightfully are convinced that the democratic party is not going to change, I guess what's the, like, what's your mindset about where to go then? Cause like acting just like, you know, I, I have kind of been at that point for a while. Um, I'm a very, I'm a big skeptic of the democratic party always have been ever since I was much younger than I am currently. Like is the DSA, like, should there be an infiltration strategy, like take over the party kind of like the left has kind of been hoping would happen with like the post-Burnit
584.62 620.86 SPEAKER_00  insurgents? So that was the original DSA was founded with that strategy. Um, we call that a realignment strategy. Um, and the idea was you take over the Democrats from the inside, fix them, move them to the left. Um, DSA is largely, uh, I don't want to say entirely, cause I think we do still have, um, some people who in good faith believe that that is the best path forward. Um, but DSA is official line at this point is that we are moving toward building our own party. Um, the debate is less about, uh, that we want to do that and more about how and what the timeline is.
621.24 702.36 SPEAKER_00  Um, it also, you know, we debate somewhat internally about like, we haven't come to the full conclusion about what party means. Most of us, when we say it are talking about, um, the way sort of global left parties look. So sort of mass parties like PT or Moss, um, some, you know, people who grew up in the U S and understand politics really in a U S context really think of it as a ballot line. So, you know, the democratic party, isn't really a party, right? It's like a sort of weird network of consultants and donors and like, you can't join the democratic party and fix it. Like there's some democratic clubs locally and depending on the state, whatever, but you're not, you can't just like, I'm a democratic party member and I'm going to fight for like, that's not how it works. You vote in primaries. That's as much as you get. Um, so we want to build a party that is actually democratic, like lowercase D democratic, where the members of the party get to help decide what the course is and what the, you know, who the candidates are, if we're going to run them and how we build working class organization outside of the electoral sphere. So unions and tenant unions and, um, and other sorts of working class, uh, you know, structures that help people move in unison to demand, uh, liberation from the capitalist class. Okay. That's an interesting, I guess I didn't
702.36 752.18 SPEAKER_04  realize that was like the shifted DSA line, uh, away from the like infiltration sort of like fix the party, um, idea. Uh, I I'm sure you guys remember like right after, I think the Democrats lost this recent election, uh, to Trump, Bernie Sanders sent out like a series of like press releases and like tweets saying he, I forget exactly what the statement was, but there was a lot of hope that he would kind of embrace or endorse a creation of a new party. Because I think there is really like kind of a weakness with the democratic party where there's like, people are genuinely like the people are sick of this party. And I think there's such a good opening to, who knows, maybe replace, it would be really hard to replace the democratic party, but like there's an opening for something.
752.42 762.10 SPEAKER_04  And I, I feel like it's just a matter of time until that something happens. So that's, that's really interesting that the DSA is kind of having a dialogue about that. I hadn't genuinely no clue.
762.10 799.58 SPEAKER_00  Yeah. And, and, you know, my own, the case that I make is the DSA, is that something? And I read those emails from Bernie and I was like, yeah, we're right here. We've been right here. We endorsed you. We like worked really hard for you. We were here. Um, and so, you know, uh, there's, there is often like this thing, like we need to invent a new thing. And it's like, okay, inventing a new thing is actually not easier than taking a thing that you have some infrastructure for and some, some resources in and building it into the thing you want it to be. Um, not saying that that's easy, right? It's
799.58 827.30 SPEAKER_04  not, you know, it's not easy. It's a, it's a way uphill battle, frankly, in this country with the amount of money behind all political parties that exist right now, I guess both political parties that exist. Um, cause that's always been like the problem with parties, like the green party too, in my opinion, is that they run the presidential election, a failed candidate over and over and over. Sorry, sorry, Jill Stein, but come on three times now, three elections. What are you doing?
827.50 836.34 SPEAKER_04  And that's all they do. They just throw out a presidential candidate and like, you know, like actually build something, you know, like have grassroots movement.
837.06 857.42 SPEAKER_00  And I think some people are frustrated that DSA, you know, isn't like running 30 Senator, you know, 30 candidates for Senate every election. And we didn't have a presidential, uh, candidate this time around, but I think we don't, we don't want to do that sort of theory of change that the green party has. And I appreciate that they bring these, you know, discussions to the forefront.
857.68 862.62 SPEAKER_00  I have no animosity for the green party. I just don't think their theory of change is very effective.
862.62 871.60 SPEAKER_00  I just don't think it's ultimately like an advertising theory of change, right? You're like, if I put this out here and I say it loud enough, then everybody will hear me and they'll buy my thing.
871.60 875.78 SPEAKER_00  And I don't think that works. I think you actually have to build some things.
876.18 887.70 SPEAKER_03  And are you feeling cynical about electoral politics in general, or is it really specifically just that that is not the strategy that the DSA is working with right now?
888.24 911.12 SPEAKER_00  Well, I don't think I'm cynical about electoral politics at all. I think, um, I think I'm cynical about the two party system as it exists. And I think that I'm cynical about the idea that you can just shoot the moon, like from nowhere. I think that right now, like, like building up municipal benches, which we are, you know, we have, um, New York city has a bunch of DSA, uh, people in city council.
911.22 926.78 SPEAKER_00  New York state assembly has a bunch of DSA members. Um, we have people in Portland. We have people like we have city council people. We have them in places that you wouldn't expect. We have, there's a city councilman in St. Petersburg, Florida. Um, we've got one in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
926.78 934.36 SPEAKER_00  Like there are people building these benches, um, school boards, town councils, um, state assemblies.
934.52 985.80 SPEAKER_00  State assemblies are really important. Um, a lot of power in those state houses and intentionally gatekept, right? Like a lot of state house, um, like the job, it, you know, you have to be there for a hundred days a year and it only pays, you know, $12,000 or something. So you can't be anything but some rich lawyer and do the job or just, you know, person with family money. So a teacher can't do the job because of the way the schedule is or that kind of thing. So figuring out how to tackle those, um, and then using that to build that bench and then building toward Congress, the Senate and the presidency. I understand that that's slow and I understand that it's not, um, as fast as, as, uh, sort of sparky as you want it to be. Like it's harder to get excited about a city council candidate, but I think that's where the power building comes from for sure.
986.74 1018.98 SPEAKER_04  And the thing like with those that I've seen in the past is if it's like super local like that, I can't think of an example off the top of my head just cause I wasn't prepared to come up with one, but there's been so many instances of like a left leaning candidate leaning heavily into very localized like issues for the constituency and doing very well because they actually kind of, they care about these local issues that people will get out for. Cause it's like, oh, there's this pothole in the spot that everyone is like running over and they have to get their tire fixed. It's like, you know, super local stuff like that actually brings people out.
1019.50 1072.42 SPEAKER_00  Totally. Um, and, and one thing that's really funny, I had a conversation with, um, with our person who's a city council person in St. Pete. Um, and he was talking about how it's really funny because he, he ran on the democratic party line, which most, most of our candidates do, um, where, where, uh, uh, independent line is not possible or where it just makes sense to do it because a lot of people just vote based on the column, not further information. Um, but he was talking about how the Republicans never know what to expect because sometimes he goes with them on stuff and they're like, well, but he's like the most liberal, right? Cause they were always the most liberal when we're socialists. He's the most liberal. And yet every now and again, he's with us on something and they can't figure him out. Um, even though, you know, like if I were to look at his voting record, I'd be like, yeah, no, this is completely consistent with socialist values.
1072.82 1094.08 SPEAKER_00  Um, but yeah, that's, it's a, it's a funny thing. They're not quite sure what to do with us. Um, they definitely, uh, yeah, don't necessarily expect, uh, the, um, complexity of, of, of, of, uh, of, uh, socialist, uh, in office, but, um, that's kind of, that's part of the fun of the game,
1094.16 1111.20 SPEAKER_04  right? Yeah. No one, it seems like no one really ever expects like, like even online, if I'm like, you know, arguing, which I have a little bit today, just cause it's a very like busy day. Cause like we're, we're looking at a potential as of recordings a day. I don't, I don't know what's going to happen, but like, we're looking at a potential government shutdown.
1111.48 1135.96 SPEAKER_04  And like, I was saying these things and they're like, Oh, just like, you know, your Soros checks, like you love your billionaires, but you hate Musk. And it's like, not, not really. Like, I don't know who you think I am. I like, I don't like billionaires. Like, unlike you, you hate Soros, but you like Musk. I hate both of them actually. Like they're both equally bad. Well, maybe not equally, but they're both bad. Um, none of these people ever know what
1135.96 1153.52 SPEAKER_00  to like say. Yeah. They're both close enough to the same amount of bad that it's like a statistical, you know, whatever it's we're in the, we're in the margin of error for sheer amount of evil they've caused. Yeah. Because you can't be a billionaire without exploiting God knows how many people.
1153.68 1172.60 SPEAKER_00  Like if, if I'm St. Peter and I'm making the tally at the gate, you probably exploited a lot of people. And yeah, you like maybe supporting, you know, somebody, I don't know, dredging a really dirty beach somewhere does not make up for the amount of people you.
1174.74 1208.64 SPEAKER_02  So we have the strategy shift here. And what I had, we had kind of talked about how we wanted to frame this episode was like a couch to 5k, but for organizing. So say you are like a lot of people that we talk to in our community, just online or in person, whatever that just feel paralyzed by how impossible it seems to do anything meaningful politically these days. What, how, what's the first step? And then how do we build on that until we're doing something meaningful?
1209.76 1214.44 SPEAKER_00  Well, I will start with full bias and say that I think you should join your local DSA chapter.
1215.32 1311.22 SPEAKER_00  Because obviously it's like literally my job to tell people to do that. But I also think you, DSA is really well equipped to deal with people who have not organized before and to sort of put you into a position where you're able to do some organizing and make some change. I would say also like if you're not unionized and you have the ability to be unionized, unionizing is a really, really good way to start building working class power, right? Or tenant union, you know? So if you're maybe in a large building, maybe consider trying to figure out how to make a tenant union. There are resources out there. And, you know, if you're not, if you're like, maybe you're, you just rent, you know, one side of a duplex, you can also make a neighborhood tenant union where just you sign people up in your neighborhood and you fight as tenants for things like not just your housing, but also like making the school better. Because since you're not a homeowner, you don't always get the same amount of say so. But if you're a tenant union and you're organized, you can, you know, demand those kinds of things. You can demand that pothole be fixed and just confuse the conservatives because you weird commies showed up and you're like, yeah, no, actually we don't want our axles to bend either. And there you go. But yeah, so, so join something. I would argue that it should be something that has a theory of change that involves like mass movement, worker power, and then dig into some sort of project. And that sounds kind of glib. Like how do I dig into a project? But odds are good.
1311.34 1311.98 SPEAKER_02  What kind of project and how?
1312.36 1312.64 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1313.08 1359.46 SPEAKER_04  I guess, I guess I could give an example. I, you know, I haven't been active in the last year, sadly, just because I've been very busy, but the, I used to live much closer than I currently do to Milwaukee and the Milwaukee DSA chapter, um, took this very local issue of the energy company in that area in like Eastern Wisconsin, the Eastern, like on, on Lake Michigan, basically North to South is this company called We Energies and the Milwaukee DSA, uh, put together an organizing force and got like actually a lot of local people, local organizers, not even associated with the DSA, um, to try to nationalize, not nationalize, I guess, what would that be? I guess it would be nationalized for the city, um, specifically.
1359.68 1361.38 SPEAKER_00  You make it public. It's a public power.
1361.62 1361.74 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1361.98 1377.46 SPEAKER_04  Public, public ownership, uh, of energy of the city, city. So like he, they, like they would, they would basically, I forget the exact specifics of that, um, whole organizing. It was called the, the, the project that they were running and I think still are, it was called a power to the people.
1377.46 1393.60 SPEAKER_04  And yeah, they wanted to make energy in the city public. And they had an example of some, cause people at this meeting, I went to the kickoff meeting for this whole thing. There was maybe close to 120 people in this like really tiny church. I don't know if it was a church.
1393.66 1459.18 SPEAKER_04  I can't remember just like this community building and people were like, so how, how is this going to be done? How are we going to make energy public for the city? And they, you know, the, the, the organizer, one of the DSA local chapter heads, uh, pointed out there was like a, in Iowa, there was an example of a city doing exactly what they had proposed and they were working off of that framework to make it public. So like, I, I guess that's an example of get involved in something. Um, again, like I said, I haven't been active up there in a little bit. I don't know if that power to the people project is still going. If you are in the Milwaukee area, highly recommend that because I went to that kickoff meeting, like I said, and there was a lot of just like local community people, not even people involved with DSA that came and, uh, like spoke about how in the winter, um, their power gets shut off and they're freezing. They have no heat. And it's like, some of these issues are really, really like, you can do a lot of good for people if you get involved in these sort of smaller scale, but for a lot of people, it's really not that small scale, you know?
1460.04 1487.62 SPEAKER_00  Yeah. Um, and one thing that I really liked that they did with that specific campaign is they really worked hard to make sure that everything was bilingual. So they were holding their meetings with a translator. Um, all their materials were bilingual. So they were making sure they weren't just excluding people. Um, which is, you know, it's not just, it's not just morally good, but it's actually strategically good, right? You want, if you're working classes significantly, a hispanophone, you want to make sure that you have your materials in Spanish. Um, so yeah.
1487.70 1524.94 SPEAKER_04  Absolutely. No, I mean, it's, it's especially good for Milwaukee because I mean, it's, it's no secret that Milwaukee's, you know, I mean, it's a very diverse city, but it's also one of the most heavily segregated cities in the country still just due to like redlining, um, policy in the past. So, so getting Pete, like outreach like that is great because it can bring all sorts of different people, which it did. There was a lot of, you know, for DSA, the stereotype is like, oh, it's white young people, but there was old black, like old black people, Hispanic people, young people too. Like there was so many different types of people at this event that it was just the kickoff. It was the first event for this thing, which was really cool to see.
1525.44 1604.90 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, for sure. And so what's cool about campaigns like that is not only do you potentially win something that is like beneficial to the, you know, the working class where you live, where people are not freezing to death, which is a nice thing to not die. Yeah. It's kind of huge. Yeah. It's like kind of a big deal. Um, but you're also building a structure, right? You have these lists with a bunch of phone numbers on them and you have a bunch of people's names and you can like, okay, so now we won this power campaign and now we want to run three people for city council. Well, look, we have this list of people who are, who knocked doors for this thing. Maybe they'll knock doors for that thing. We're going to, you know, talk to them right away. And so then you kind of build these things or you, or you say like, okay, there's this new warehouse coming and we want to unionize it. Let's call through our list and see if anybody wants to salt the warehouse. Like anybody looking for a job, we're going to send you in. We're going to send in 30 people in this warehouse of, you know, with a staff of a thousand and we're going to see if we can unionize it. And so anything where you're kind of building these lists and connecting people in a way that they are able to feel the power of like moving together in unison as a community, um, just build you that much closer to the next step. And if we can do that everywhere, we can actually win. For sure. I'm curious. I know
1604.90 1643.46 SPEAKER_03  that right now I, I speak for myself and probably a lot of other people they're feeling, I would say kind of demoralized. And I'm wondering if, um, you have any advice to find that motivation beyond like, suck it up and deal. Like, I'm just wondering like what your experience has been after this election where it feels like, I mean, it's felt like this for a long time, but it really crystallized in my head that just like, we have one party that abjectly hates everyone I care about. And then one party that's like indifferent to dislikes everyone I care about.
1644.00 1663.00 SPEAKER_03  And I'm just like, these are the two parties that are battling for power. And I feel very much out in the cold. So in that situation, like, how do you feel, uh, how do you feel more empowered and like, what is it about organization that makes you feel more empowered?
1664.16 1678.00 SPEAKER_00  Yeah. So I, you know, spent most of my adult life as a, as a liberal, as like a kind of John Stewart lib. Um, I'm 41. So that's for that context. And I was in my, I was, oh God. Okay.
1678.00 1735.26 SPEAKER_00  I would have been 36 or seven when I started organizing. Um, like, or, so I don't, I'd done some other stuff. I'd done like gun advocacy and like kind of classic lib bomb things. Um, but started organizing as a socialist and like getting socialism. Um, and it just organizing and actually fighting for things for the community and like actually winning and seeing what it means to have the power of like a movement and not just, um, three people with a very convincing op-ed, um, which, which it is fun. It's fun to drop a banger in the op-eds, but, but, um, actually getting together with people and winning something is the great motivator. Um, that doesn't mean that I don't like feel bad, um, right now, you know, I, I do and have, um, I, you know, some of it is just suck it up.
1735.26 1743.72 SPEAKER_00  Um, I like to remind myself, like one of my grandmothers worked in a factory making chains and she pushed a button on a machine that made lawnmower chains for like 40 years.
1743.84 1765.46 SPEAKER_00  The other one worked in a factory that made typewriters and she pushed a button on a machine that made typewriters for like 40 years. And, um, I have been given an opportunity to do, um, a lot more and travel and see the world. And, and my life is not so bad. And, um, and I can fight for people who maybe are still pushing a fucking button on a, on a chain making machine.
1765.46 1772.48 SPEAKER_00  Um, and, you know, alongside them to, to fight for the things that, um, we both and all deserve.
1772.48 1794.38 SPEAKER_00  And yeah, um, some of it is just, uh, I don't know, you know, I, I don't love like this idea of self-care cause I think it's really important to do community care. Right. Like, like, like, okay, take a bath. Like, okay, that's not going to fix it. Um, but I think that collective,
1794.38 1803.12 SPEAKER_03  you should still take a bath though. If you're listening, not to get all Jordan Peterson on our audience, but you guys do have to take a bath and clean your room. I'm sorry. There are
1803.12 1869.28 SPEAKER_00  stereotypes that we do not want to be meeting. Like, please, I'm simply begging you, babe. Um, but yeah, take a bath, but also like, um, you know, do dumb stuff with your friends, like go, you know, play tabletop games or, or get out your ukuleles and like strum and sing awkward, you know, 2000 songs together. Um, you gotta kind of take care of each other and, and, um, find joy in each other. And I know that's like, people are like, yeah, but I'm an introvert. I'm like, all right, well then find joy with like just one or two other people or find joy in video games by yourself, but you're also maybe communicating with somebody else. But, um, I mean, I get it. I don't want to be around everybody all the time either, but you know, checking in on each other, making sure each other, okay. Like maybe don't talk to each other, just drop cookies on each other's porches. That's fine too. Um, but I think remembering that we are part of this thing, um, is really helpful. And, uh, yeah. I know. I think that is really important because I feel like
1869.28 1913.54 SPEAKER_04  when you touched on like, oh, self-care, I think the reason why like that, like very lib mindset is like not useful particularly as it's very individualistic, which is like the opposite of what we should be doing. Uh, and it's what like conservatives want us to probably be doing. And it's like probably what the democratic party wants us also to be doing, but like doing, yeah. Like, like you said, like community, like caring for people in your community, people around you, your neighbors, whoever can help build a lot more anything like solidarity. Like it could build something just because you're caring for each other and like actually helping each other out and talking to each other. I think that's so much more valuable than, yeah, like, like, uh, yeah.
1913.54 1928.74 SPEAKER_00  Taking a bath. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you know, I mean, we, as leftists, we talk a lot about mutual aid versus charity, whatever, but like, seriously, like go do a shift at the soup kitchen. You'll feel better. Um, you will, you, you, you know, it's, is it perfect politically? Whatever. Who cares?
1928.92 1960.18 SPEAKER_00  You, you did something and you're going to actually feel better. I promise. Um, go shovel the old lady down the streets sidewalk because it's got snow on it. Like just do something. It doesn't really matter what, um, it's very important to, I, I don't want to say like, it doesn't matter what you do at all ever, but I think, um, I think occasionally sometimes you just got to snap yourself out of it by physically or, you know, actively in some way making some small change for somebody else in your
1960.18 1997.46 SPEAKER_04  community. Absolutely. Um, speaking on, I think someone mentioned strikes before or like labor organizing. I think just today, 10 Amazon warehouses are on strike. And I believe just 30 minutes before starting recording a lot of either the entire Starbucks company or just a lot of them, like all the Starbucks unions announced that they're on strike now too, which is like huge. This is like a really bizarrely massive moment, like two pretty major companies going on strike all at the same time. Right before that. I guess my, my question is, Oh God, that's yeah, that's going to be kind of
1997.46 2002.94 SPEAKER_00  amazing. Imagine all the gingerbread lattes that people are going to be sitting there waiting for
2002.94 2043.10 SPEAKER_04  that won't come. Yeah, no, there's going to be such a treatler, right? Uh, uh, like revolution. All the, all the suburbanites are going to be driving their, uh, cyber trucks and like into Starbucks to try to get their lattes. I guess. So obviously labor is really important. What's like, so for someone I'm not in the Starbucks union, I'm not in an Amazon union. What is something that just like anyone can do to support these unions? Obviously do not break the picket line. Do not go to these places, but there's gotta be more than just not going to these places. Right?
2043.10 2091.90 SPEAKER_00  Yeah. So not only don't break the picket line, but go join the picket line. It's actually really fun. Like that is a fun way. And in a way that like a sort of a soul regenerating way to spend an afternoon, just go like shout at a boss. It doesn't even have to be your boss. Um, and those picket lines, you know, they need, they need extra bodies. The more people on the picket line, the more powerful it is. So go bring, you know, bring snacks, um, and, and, uh, March or just stand there and just be moral support. Um, that's really huge. I think I suspect I don't, I have not looked, but I suspect there are strike funds. Um, so if you maybe have cash, but no time, um, strike funds are always good. If, if they don't have strike funds right now, set up somebody does, I promise. Um, and that's a good way to, uh, contribute also.
2093.52 2115.70 SPEAKER_04  For sure. No, that's, that's something I've like tried to do a little bit, like go to them if I have time or strike funds. Um, but you're so right about like going to these events, uh, like just does rejuvenate your soul, not, not to go back in time a little bit and, and like, cause it's not over yet. Of course the genocide in, is in Israel and Palestine perpetrated by Israel is not done yet.
2115.70 2127.16 SPEAKER_04  They're still doing that. But in the, I think it was last summer, just this last summer that when the campus strikes were really in full force, I again, went to the, the YDSA chapter in Milwaukee.
2127.16 2183.36 SPEAKER_04  They, they set up an encampment at whatever the university is. I cannot remember the name of it, but going to that encampment and just seeing the, like the organizational efforts of these students at the college with the YDSA in particular, the YDSA from what I can gather is a lot more radical and even more active in public than like my main DSA. I don't, I don't mean to throw shade on main DSA, but from what I gather, YDSA is like really like the like real radical and like a really good way. Um, and they were like in, in Milwaukee, they were working with a local church who was like basically cooking for this encampment. This church across the street was like, they brought over food, they brought over tables for like barriers. Like they, they kind of organized the whole community in like a really amazing way. And just going there to be able to see that was kind of like mind blowing.
2183.50 2187.94 SPEAKER_04  It was, it was really impressive how organized they could be and were.
2188.86 2224.24 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, they are incredibly amazing. And also it was very brave and a lot of them are suffering very serious repercussions. Um, the closest encampment to me is, um, Cornell YDSA. And I did go the first morning they opened up and I showed up with snacks as you know, moms of teenagers do. And I brought my teenager. Um, he was, uh, let's see, he just turned 14 and I was like, well, let's go see what, what cool kids do. Um, and he had fun and, uh, yeah, so we went and brought snacks and, um, I, you know, told every mom I know, like show up with snacks and your teenagers, like, come on.
2224.24 2275.62 SPEAKER_00  Um, that's like, you gotta be a soccer mom. You show up at those encampments, then use that minivan for good. Come on. Um, so let a lot of those kids got, um, not just suspended from Cornell, but their persona non grata on Cornell campus, which Ithaca being what it is, which is so much Cornell, um, they can't really be in Ithaca. So they like had to leave. Um, I know one of the, um, one of their labor chairs is now, you know, doing some work in Buffalo for like a couple of years before he can start school again. And that, that is incredibly brave to be, um, to be bold enough to put off your education, to put off, you know, that's when you're 18, like that's kind of, you're the, the, the windshield in front of you. It's just not very far. Right. Like, you know,
2275.62 2279.46 SPEAKER_02  and they were like, we're just going to do it. Most teenagers are selfish assholes. Let's be real.
2279.58 2315.76 SPEAKER_00  That's pretty brave. I think. Yeah, absolutely. No, it's amazing. So, um, I am, I, I hesitate to say that I'm incredibly proud because it makes me sound patronizing, but I am, I'm always proud of, um, the comrades when they're out there fighting the good fight. So yeah, support your YDSA. Um, and if, if you don't have one, um, YDSA is always, um, always expanding to new campuses. Um, and you know, so if you are a DSA member, you don't have a YDSA at your local campus, um, reach out to your field organizer and they'll help you see if you can put one together. Yeah. No, uh, people in their
2315.76 2327.50 SPEAKER_04  early twenties, very ready to be very radical, um, is what I have gathered. And like, I don't know, I was early twenties. I was, and still am, I would say equally as radical as I was then.
2327.50 2377.92 SPEAKER_04  Um, so there's that just potential. There's such a, like, you know, the Democrats, not to go back to the Democrats, but the democratic party has such an underestimate, underestimation of where young people are. And it always continues. It's going to keep biting them in the ass because they don't understand. They, they bring these like youth organizers into the party. I don't want to name names. I I'm sure anyone listening or any of us here right now can name any of these people. Some of them probably at that Joe Biden, um, Viking funeral party. Uh, so like, so they, they have these people, but they don't actually represent what young people want, you know, or, or the energy that young people have in politics. Uh, it's, it's a shame that it's, they're throwing so much energy to the
2377.92 2417.18 SPEAKER_00  wayside when, when there's so much potential there. Yeah. And I think, um, specifically like, I don't only want to shout out boomers, but Gen X too, like they don't get that these kids are growing up with zero hope, right? These kids who were born after nine 11, the world has never been good. Um, I turned 18, five days before nine 11, 2001. So I had five days of adult life before, before the bad happened. Um, this is like my real origin story. Right. So, but anyway, so, so it's been like my whole adult life. It's been like, Oh, are things ever going to get good again?
2417.34 2473.14 SPEAKER_00  And so now, you know, 20, 20 couple of years down the road, um, my answer is no, right? Like, no, they're not going to get better again. That's not, that's not the case, but these kids have never seen it anywhere near hopeful. It's just been bad. The climate is collapsing the world where it like, we've got a couple of cold wars going on and a couple of hot ones going on and have their entire life. Um, it's the economy. It's like, I don't know. Has the minimum wage been raised in their lifetime? I'm not even sure, but the price of groceries sure has gone up. Um, so I don't, rent is doubled in their lifetime. Yeah. There, but there's like a generation that doesn't get, they're like, why are they so angry? It's because they're, they know their life is never going to be good. That's a pretty good reason to be angry and y'all did it. So yeah. Yeah. No, it's, it's,
2473.22 2495.86 SPEAKER_04  it's, it's a shame. It's a shame. Um, that's why I, I, I do think there needs to be DSA. There needs to be outside organization, some sort of any sort of pressure really, because there, I mean, I don't think they're ever going to change unless they're basically on, on their knees begging for, for this energy to kind of come in and save them. It has to be unbearable for them. I mean,
2495.90 2514.00 SPEAKER_00  it has to be, that's the only way, the only way to do it is to make it so that the people who are the rich and powerful are, their life becomes unbearable. They can't do all the things that are fun and good about being rich and powerful. They, we gotta make them understand what it means.
2514.02 2518.66 SPEAKER_03  To not be able to pay your rent. I'm happy to move toward that goal. That sounds great. I love
2518.66 2535.04 SPEAKER_04  that. Absolutely. And it's like so easy to message. I feel like, like, like, I don't know if you guys saw or even know who Theo Vaughn is. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, he had a show. Yeah. Great, great guy.
2535.04 2553.48 SPEAKER_04  Um, but, uh, see, he had Timothy Chalamet on his show very recently talking about the Bob Dylan movie. What was that? Another friend of the show. Sorry. Yeah, no, he's we're in talks with him right now. Um, but no, not really. I don't, or at least not that I'm aware of. Maybe, maybe we are.
2553.48 2617.82 SPEAKER_04  Yeah. Okay. Perfect. So we'll be in talks with him, but, um, he was on Theo Vaughn, which Theo Vaughn, you know, traditional dumb guy type podcaster, like Joe Rogan's fear, kind of just like perfect, perfect type of show for just like dumb guys. But Timothy Chalamet was on the show talking about like Bernie Sanders and like, like leftist, like topics and things that Pete, like the left cares about and like young people cares about. And Theo Vaughn was like, Oh yeah. Like he was like very open to, uh, what he was saying. And I think he even called Bernie Sanders like a folk hero or something. And it's like, it's so like, I don't know what we have to like, I don't know how much more we can show the democratic party that like these like dumb guys out there, these like people that don't really have specific ideologies just kind of want something new from the left or the democratic party. And you just kind of have to, all it starts with is the very basic having to say the democratic party, like kind of sucks, but you can't do that and be in the democratic party.
2618.48 2632.10 SPEAKER_00  Right. Yeah. And you know, anybody who's done like any amount of canvassing or, um, even phone banking, people have absolutely incoherent, chaotic politics, like 95% of people's politics make no sense at all.
2632.10 2650.62 SPEAKER_00  Anybody who's like ridden in a taxi or a Lyft or an Uber has like, are y'all conversing with your drivers? I can't help it because I have everybody all the time. Um, but like, I was in a cab in Dallas and the guy was like, yeah, you know, it's, it's just so, I'm so upset about Trump winning.
2650.80 2662.02 SPEAKER_00  And I just, you know, he's going to defund the schools and then he's probably going to defund the police. And then I was like, Whoa, hold on. Cause one of those things is cool.
2662.10 2670.00 SPEAKER_00  Um, I mean, but like, that's a normal set of politics. Like that is typical bog standard
2670.00 2695.66 SPEAKER_04  American politics. And, and that's the thing is like these, like the median voter does not know what they're talking about half the time. There'll be in, there'll be in similar polls, people being pulled about like, Oh, Kamala Harris is further left than Bernie Sanders. But like, then they'll say, so they think Kamala Harris is like very far left compared to him, but then they'll be like, Oh, I'm conservative, but they like Bernie Sanders more. And that's like, what are you talking about?
2695.78 2724.98 SPEAKER_04  What do you mean you're moderate? But think Bernie Sanders is more moderate and Kamala Harris, like there is no whenever. So whenever like liberals are like, see, look at this poll, people say they're moderates. And it's like in the same poll, they think Kamala Harris is a communist and Bernie Sanders is a moderate. Like people in this country don't operate in terms of specific set out, well thought out ideologies. People operate in a way where they just, they, they like the sound of something that is genuinely what people operate in. If they like the sound of something, they're like, yeah.
2725.76 2785.24 SPEAKER_00  And I think that people know that stuff's pretty bad and it's not working. And, um, and of course there are like the, these sort of over entrenched, like we have terrible racism in this country that is part of the capitalist system that is just going to always, um, no, it's not always because we're going to fix it. But, but it is a major factor in these decisions people make, but ultimately most people are like, yeah, stuff's really bad. I literally cannot make sense of why, because I don't have a coherent ideology, but somebody should change. And so Donald Trump shows up and he's like, I'm going to change stuff. And they're like, all right, let's give it a shot. Um, and yeah, I mean, I think there probably is a, a subsection of people who are just absolute like fascist bigots who, um, I don't want to say they can't be helped, but they're not, they're not, uh, the target market for getting a majority. Um, but all that mushy middle, those people are all just in need of, uh, you know, socialist Jesus.
2787.74 2788.22 SPEAKER_04  Absolutely.
2790.08 2792.96 SPEAKER_00  Probably not Jesus, but it's a social, you know, social Jesus.
2792.96 2797.46 SPEAKER_03  I knew what you meant. A symbolic Jesus, a symbolic Karl Marx.
2800.50 2800.98 SPEAKER_02  Amazing.
2802.64 2810.78 SPEAKER_02  As we kind of wrap this up, um, do we have any closing thoughts, any words of optimism, wisdom to our, to our listeners, Megan?
2812.26 2845.52 SPEAKER_00  Um, yeah, I mean, it, it feels bad. I get it. I also feel bad. I'm with you. Um, but it also, it has never been more important to get in the fight because now is the time, you know, the fight is easiest when the cracks appear in the, in the foundation and the cracks are there, the contradictions are there and it's our job to get organized and get in there and blast it wide open. Um, so we need you, we need people, we need, we need whatever skills you have.
2845.58 2855.14 SPEAKER_00  We need to whatever background you have, whatever horrifying experiences with capitalism you have, because I bet you would have a bunch. Um, I went to business school. I'm not sure how I can help.
2857.94 2904.62 SPEAKER_00  It is. Sometimes you'll be sitting there with somebody else and you start like listing off your radicalizing events. And all you can think about is like, like, why didn't I radicalize way sooner? Like, why was I not actually born radicalized? Because every single, so many events in my life have been, um, horrifying and somebody else's fault because they wanted to make money and, and we don't have to live like that. So, but we have to collectively act. Um, we're not just going to convince people by having the right ideas and posting them online. I'm sorry. I wish that were the answer. It is not, unfortunately, the answer we have to be in, uh, some sort of formation with each other where we're moving, um, in that direction. So get in it. Um, yeah, we're, we're here for each other.
2904.62 2910.86 SPEAKER_00  That's all we got. Um, we will win. I do believe it. I do too. Despite where we're at right now.
2911.46 2916.76 SPEAKER_04  I am, I'm optimistic to a fault, even when things are very bad. So I, I do agree. I, I think,
2916.76 2931.28 SPEAKER_02  I think eventually goddamn, I think we will win. Yeah. Um, okay. Uh, let's, uh, let's bring this one home. Megan, is there anything you'd like to plug, uh, plug the DSA first and then anything else?
2931.28 2985.78 SPEAKER_00  Yeah. Um, join DSA. If you're not already a member, dsausa.org slash join. Um, it's easy to remember because it's the democratic socialists of America of the United States of America, as my 14 year old likes to point out, dsausa.org. Um, whatever, I guess that was the website that was available back when they built it. So, uh, dsausa.org, um, or find your local DSA chapter and go just check out a meeting, check out a, check out an action, check out a rally. And, uh, yeah, definitely. If you're anywhere near any of these Amazon, um, uh, of these, uh, I'm sorry, the teamster strikes, um, yeah. On the Amazon warehouses or the Starbucks strikes, um, get out there. That's there. I promise those are some fun picket lines right now. I saw, I saw a lot of pictures of them today and they looked like they were having a good time. There's not one near me, but, um, I might have to gas up the minivan and go find one tomorrow. So amazing. All right.
2985.78 2992.84 SPEAKER_02  Thank you so much, Megan. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you for coming on. All right. This was a blast.
2992.84 2997.76 SPEAKER_02  Absolutely. And we'll see you guys, uh, uh, next week. See ya.
