See you later on... welcome back to western kabuki um we are joined every week by our co-hosts june how are you doing i'm doing amazing this week uh my my belly is full i'm slapping my belly it was a great thanks yeah thanksgiving week my i am so full and uh rotund at the moment i am inflating just like the elon musk uh that was bubbled out and like he like he's a balloon if you've seen that i look exactly like him right now hell yeah but i'm doing i'm doing amazing uh alex how you doing pal uh my thanksgiving sucked hard and i'm really glad to be home oh yeah any fun stories or is it just depressing it was just like family with health problems my my daughter and i were like we were in michigan and the snow it was snowing and we were like fuck yeah let's go run around in the snow i immediately fell and snapped my glasses in half so i was in michigan blind i was just like in the pissiest mood the old the whole time and of course kids traveling they just like it fucks with their attitudes man they get really it was tough it was tough i'm glad to be back it seems to be the case where like if you're in a like a parent like vacations with kids can either be like an amazing experience that's super memorable or like horribly stressful and just miserable it's like a 50 50 shot where it could just be one or the other i mean part of it is like i'm locked in a battle right now with my six-year-old daughter to like actually try food other than chicken nuggets and i was like dude that is a rough spot to be and i was like i was like hey poly just so you know we're not fucking doing chicken nuggets on thanksgiving and it was just like i know that it was a mistake i made i made a mistake i was not up for that fight i'm gonna put you up on i'm gonna put you up on some game right now all right um you can lie to children they suck they don't know anything like you could just be like you could just be like dude this is these are chicken nuggets like so like i i my little brother had the same problem and then i was like trying to get him to eat brussel sprouts and bacon and then i was like dude these are german chicken nuggets and he was just like he was like no way i'm like yeah dude like and he totally believed it and he's like these are so good but the problem is now he asked my dad for german chicken nuggets and my dad has no idea what the hell he's talking about so i mean like yeah you could just lie to kids it's fine alex you should do that and report back yeah next time next time marcos is on we'll do a private report okay um we we're going to do another boring lame news show tonight and there's going to be enough time for that uh june found uh june stumbled which we'll have her read some of here in a little bit june stumbled onto something that i think is kind of near and dear to to mine and marcos's heart and so when when i saw that she'd found this i was like yeah we got it we got it we got to call marcos um we got to call marcos and get him in on this guy call him the homie um we're not we're going from nap time to yap time uh we're taking the ice pill tonight are you guys ready to get ice filled i'm so ready so before we kind of go in because yeah we were just like originally when we were recording we were just going to do like a episode like there's always great news to talk about love it love news i i scroll news on my phone every single day i'm addicted to news but i woke up this morning and was i found this thread on twitter and went on like an hour deep dive and i was like i i need can we like i texted you guys i was like can we like today switch to doing like an episode on this shit that i found yeah i i was i was so into it i i'm so excited uh my nephew is getting his uh he won't hear this so it's fine but he's getting his first guitar for christmas this year and like for me as a musician for that type my sister like helped me pick one out and i get to be involved in that i'm so proud and happy and excited for you to text an ice wall conspiracy thread to me i was like oh it was like the same feeling i was like yes it's like it's it's time it's finally time to to talk this is like what you did this morning is like what i'm doing every night instead of like having sex or whatever like having a girlfriend i'm just like i'm seeing i'm just reading this shit and i'm i'm becoming the information pip you're like on a journey you have laid out ahead of you it's it's what philip's describing right now doesn't it sound glamorous i see the first i see the first first footstep and i've put my foot in that that hole so i am i'm i'm ready i'm going i'm trucking along i'm i'm all in on this this is this is it brought me so much joy like it like simultaneously brought me so much joy but terror that people believe this uh should we start out then by having you read a little bit of the thread that you found and then we can go from there yeah um do you want me to just kind of start from the top do we go i don't want to like should should that be how we intro what we're kind of talking about the ice walls or should we should we give a pretext no you know what let's let's let's introduce the audience just how you found it i think that's a good way to do this okay yeah so so this morning yeah i so as i'm saying woke up opened as you do x the everything app the it has all the information everything you could ever want to know is there then you don't want to know also yeah there's a lot of stuff you don't want to know like i'm devastated i found out today that destiny was part of the kiss guys night community and like that's destroy i too much information yeah we know too much about each other but so i i you know as you do you open twitter just bullshit gets thrown in front of you that people you don't follow people no one you know follows this person so i the first post i saw i it says it's just from some random account uh named q mom so i should have got the first hint right there it's a q anon adjacent account um so the the post reads as the passage through to the lands beyond the ice wall and it's just like a picture like at first glance for someone like me that has not heard of the ice wall theory before i was just like oh interesting because i'm a science person i love science i love nature i i went to college for ecology so i'm looking at this photo like oh that's like some beautiful like glacial like structures like it's beautiful and then you look down a little bit in the same photo and it's like wait what is this it's it's so it so there's a map there's two maps here and one of them is like the planet we know earth and it's surrounded by a wall of ice with a small opening on one side and there's more continents outside that ice wall there's like five more continents all with different names one of them is like pitanum one of them is like thoth uh and then there's a about thoth the real thoth heads know about this ice planet from fucking star wars no that's hoth a little context on that thoth is the egyptian god of wisdom but here's the kicker here right there is no god of egyptian lore named thoth yeah that's actually history yeah alistair crawley alistair crawley was like yeah i talked to a dude named thoth he had a crow's head and he's in egyptian and there and everyone was like yeah i remember reading that and that's awesome yeah it's tight any of you guys play dungeons and dragons really quick because this i'm a little bit okay so if you look at like how the like the plane system works and like dungeons and dragons and the maps that they have this is completely and totally just straight up lifted from that really yes dude yes oh my god you know i'm not even surprised like some of this just feels fantasy like i don't know if you i don't know if you're aware of this right but like so the outer continents of of beyond the ice wall right that's where like dragons and wizards and shit live okay and then beyond that is like aliens i'm not joking i wish i was joking like that this is their world view right beyond that is like aliens so like they're in their minds this is how brains work we're like trapped in the center and our brains are like conjuring up these memories of being outside of the wall okay and we write them down as fantasy and then depending on how far your your memory or past life regression or whatever it is that they call it like you know sci-fi and then like beyond the third beyond that wall is like true enlightenment like guys like jesus and buddha and shit like yeah there was one like valhalla there's one valhalla so so in this theory at least the one i found there's two ice walls so the first within the first ice wall is the planet earth so this is a flat earth theory this is a flat earth based theory um if you haven't caught that yet but um so the first ice wall it it's like a circle around what we know as the planet and then there's the the second ice wall with the other continents and then there's more openings for that other ice wall which in later in this thread i found what you're talking about marcos where it's like valhalla it's like the these like volcanic wastes and like all of these places that just straight up i mean maybe we're wrong maybe they do exist maybe we're gonna learn a little something tonight um but these these i've already learned so much i don't know if i could learn much more i don't want to learn anymore but all of this stuff is all of this stuff is based on on like what they call i'm not even this is an actual thing like among the conspiracy not conspiracy theory it's hard this there's like a there's a type of conspiracy theories that's like i'm not stupid enough to fall for this but i do but i am like cartograph i am like doing a cartography of these lands just in case they might be real but i know yeah you're just like it's just crazy because if you look at like some of the books and literature that do exist by the way they're like all this is like everybody's kind of doing their own arg and like they're very talented writers but they're like making a world for themselves kind of and everybody is just like that sounds better than like there's kind of a through like a through line or an underlying thesis for a lot of we've talked about on the show of just like people turn to these things because of distrust in like institutions and and and reactions to like material conditions declining and all that so like i genuinely think that this is just like this idea throwing myself into this is like better than like having to exist in this youngest world that we live in now yeah and uh like they are very talented fantasy writers that should all be right they're not though that dude this is the problem though they're not they're not like i i get what you're trying to i understand you're trying to be gracious but they're hacky because it is very because like all of this is based on like what they call i'm not even kidding you this is the phrase for it's don tan universalis right and it's the idea this is a crazy ass and this is real deep there's like six guys right now that just got schizo activated in your listenership right they just they just they just sprung like who how does he know it's called yeah it's called don tan universalis and it's essentially the divine comedy it's how dante structured the universe right and so like they think they read the divine comedy and didn't see is like well this is obviously like they didn't have twitter back in the day this was italian twitter that's what dante's inferno was it absolutely is if you read the annotation of dante's inferno it's all him being like it's all him being like the person who's in the eighth circle of hell is this dude who he lent money and didn't pay him back it's just like people he had personal grievances with in italy in hell this guy chews too much this guy chews too loud so he's in the seventh circle of hell like i'm not joking that's literally like absolutely true dude yeah it's twitter yeah what are you doing and that's why like if you all of the all of the beauty like in the divine comedy like all of the angels like the levels of heaven and shit are all like people like this beautiful woman that passed me by one day like as i like like while i was writing this like that's that's what an angel is in his mind you know what's crazy cat called it's like yeah literally hey you're looking really nice i swear to god it's crazy but they they they saw him write that and were like no he saw he got a glimpse into how the real world is structured do you get what i'm saying so like their worldview is based on a very stupid on a lack of of material history right and it's a lack of one reading comprehension and material history like they can't and they just treat it as scripture like so and that's a kind of just zoom out a little bit to like more i guess conventionally normie like religious beliefs so many people treat the divine comedy as if it was like scripture scripture and very clearly it's not it's italian it's italian twitter yeah it's italian twitter is what it was twitter before they literally they had to the italians were so catty they needed something like that you know what i'm thing and then they they interred it into like yeah this is the greatest this is our greatest achievement you know i mean i think it just goes to show throughout all of history humans humanity's always been kind of like petty hate like haters absolutely yeah people love being haters what is it that like like the sixth century bc where that guy was like you know like peteos gave me bad bronze like what the fuck and he like wrote it down in cuneiform like that's an actual you can look that up that's a historical document some guy was like this guy sold me fucked up bronze and like have you ever seen that like that like original piece of graffiti which is like it's like uh it's from ancient rome and it's like a picture of jesus with a donkey's head and it's like and it basically says like uh the guy's name is alex actually it's like alex fucking believes in jesus look at the this is what i think it's like amazing dude no like so much of the my i legitimately believe like i i don't hate this kind of stuff right historically i think it's mad important to me what's more significant historically is not a great piece of art or painting or anything like that but it's like a guy scrolling like on in a bathhouse like teleos is gay right like that that's history right there yeah that's way more historically important to let us jacking off when vesuvius exploded is the pentacle dude yes exactly all all of that stuff is way more historically important because it lets us know that like as far as we continue moving away from like what we can consider primitive we're really not moving that we're not advancing as fast or as far as we think we are yeah right like cultural improvement versus scientific improvement are two different types of improvement there's still a guy if like if like mount rainier blew up i would just start just yeah cranking it it's like we have not changed that much yeah if shasta explodes dude if shasta explodes i'm like i'm going spread eagle i'm like yo i'm showing listen this is gonna be we're doing a funny one we're doing a silly one okay well this episode is definitely going to be a patreon one yeah they're gonna catch me yeah people in a thousand years are gonna know i'm goofy as far yeah i was goofing okay okay let's get let's uh let's get back so june you find this thread and you find this amazing map right so so i was just like digging through the replies because i was just like this is so funny to me i was so so fascinated like because i i guess for context i have known about the flat earth theory i think most people know about flat earthers they know what it is exactly and i've never seen this aspect of it i've always just been like seeing like oh people think the earth is flat and like you can't like you know they do the dumb shit with like oh the horizon proves that it's not like around or whatever like a like a planet um so to me this is like a first look into like a i would assume this is like a layer deeper of the like flat earth conspiracy this is like just beyond what most people know so i was like really i was really having fun this is like super cool and i was digging through the replies you were becoming there's this one person huh you were becoming an information i was like maybe i'll earn my um doctorate at the end of today um but no so i was just like digging through the replies seeing what people were saying about this and there was this one person called wr schcock yes qbd friend of the show he says will you read his bio real quick because it was so funny i didn't actually read it before so this is the first time uh for me uh so it says i ion techs quantum biodynamics developing next level blot blotch chain tesla pmv pmf multiple quantum physics patents inventor vortex chillers employer engineer designer i don't know what any of that means no i know exactly what that he's doing he's it's it's this is cubic time this is time cube everyone literally everyone is doing time cube now which is so sick everyone is a time cubist now he had to hit us with blockchain by the way yeah block no it's a blockchain it's different the blockchain is entirely different structure you wouldn't get it so this guy uh let me let me get back here so he replies to that original tweet that i read a minute ago and he says here are the receipts for the ice wall how it works and what's on the other side so i was like oh hell yeah all right let's let's dig in so he links right there to a reply of his to another post which is just a flat earth account that's that says it posts like a tiktok and the post says even the countries that hate each other have mysteriously agreed that antarctica is off limits and must remain untouched what are they really hiding there and then this guy replies to that which is what he linked saying the dome update october 15th 2024 already on some good shit right there yeah he's updating so so he says he starts this is really long by the way so i don't know if we'll get through all of this yeah just summarize it's really long he he is using the like 4 000 character limit on twitter to the max hell yeah um so he starts yeah he's he's super schizo it's amazing so he says countries from around the world that historically cannot agree on anything came together and passed the antarctic treaty that says you can't step foot on that land mass the treaty was formed in 1961 with 56 current countries participating so i'm just gonna stop there i don't know too much about that treaty i didn't look into it but i assume it's not exactly accurate because it's not true it's right it's literally it's a 1000 100 fabrication so it doesn't exist it's yeah antarctica is treated the it's antarctica the politics of antarctica is mad fascinating because essentially what it is is that like all of these countries that don't get along and can't get along all realize that like hey there's this massive land mass up there that's probably got a ton of resources yeah uh we can't touch any of it but what we can do is work together to figure out how to extract how to extract the resources destroy the earth in a brand new way they do so that's what they're doing that it's not they're saying that private citizens can't go and that's true like you can't mount a private you couldn't go like you can go to antarctica it's true that you can but only on like pre-approved tours and cruises but like part of that is just because of the bureaucracy of how like antarctica is governed and marco is completely completely correct it is very interesting because it started during the cold war and somehow we still managed to make these agreements and um like you know various governments kind of oversee specific parts of the continent and it's just like uh and plus like you know if you go there just by yourself if you make it there you'll just die yeah if you go die of exposure notoriously pretty cold down there yeah i don't know if you guys know about that one so it's like kind of true that you can't go there like you can but it's it is pretty controlled we'll have to give them a half a point there yeah half a because like i when i read that i was like that can't because i know like scientists go there for expeditions people do all kinds of like government and even private um like uh expeditions you can go and you can work in antarctica and all that stuff i thought people just didn't go there because of the thing you know yeah no that's listen things are it's the things are legal now it's fine like we gotta we gotta treaty with them they're chilling we're chilling you know what i'm saying we give i'm australian once a year it's fine right yeah so he so he says that and immediately i'm like all right uh seems wrong but i'm still i'm still on board i'm still ready to learn about the dome uh so he says today these 50 56 nations enforce the no expeditions from sea and no fly zone from air making sure no one breaches this continent surrounded by 140 foot vertical walls that look like they were engineered as a smooth wall barrier rather than a naturally formed glacial edge you can take a flight over a certain section of antarctica but the ticket will cost you 10 times as much as normal and there will be no passenger windows to make sure you cannot see any of the lands below i don't know it seems pretty suspicious right that's pretty weird why would you pay just like from a consumer perspective why would you pay tens of thousands of dollars to fly in a fart tube with no windows that doesn't even make sense as a product you know what i'm saying like that that can't be correct that can't be true yeah it can't be true again didn't look into it but i'm just willing to accept it um he's probably right about that one as well um and he links to a wikipedia page i'm not going to read through it but it's it's just about the antarctic treaty system um which we have talked about just a minute ago he probably just totally lied about so i'm curious why he linked to the wikipedia i don't think because i don't think he lied i think he didn't read it he did he did what everyone else does which is he reads this is how most people myself included read wikipedia articles they just read the the the big black texts you know i'm saying the the headers yeah yeah and they're like yeah i'm aware now i know everything i'm fully informed i don't even know anything else and that's exactly he saw like oh these countries have a problem oh they're in a treaty okay cool no suspicious yeah it's a little suspicious so he continues if your boat or plane were to allowed to scout antarctica you would eventually learn it is the edge of our contained world under a dome and that there are that sorry and that there are three or four exits being constantly patrolled to keep you inside and there's a picture of like a gate that like it looks like a constructed glacial gate like there's like pillars made out of like i like ice and glaciers i don't know if it's like photoshopped like it's not real from game of thrones that's what i was gonna say i've never watched that show but my understanding is that's just game of thrones see i'd believe it um and then he continues there what isn't well known is the fact that a ship in any ocean in the world can set their bearings in any direction literally blindfolded and will reach the south pole how is that how is that possible that's very true marcos how is that possible how is that possible um i don't think it is the power of imagination listen i think i think like christopher columbus pretty much proved that incorrect you know what i'm saying and like the vikings before him did the same thing they were just kind of like hey we're gonna just keep going until we hit it oh cool america you know what i'm saying like they and then those and the people on the on the west coast were like hey we're gonna keep oh cool like japan we we did it guys yeah so like you have to be going in a specific direction which is well i think that people just like that you you can fly over antarctica the reason that it doesn't happen i say oh you can't fly over the south pole well the south pole is actually at like the very southeastern portion of the continent and there's like zero reason ever any commercial flight would go there just population density and so on that that that's it and so they're saying it's like illegal and it's fake and if you close your eyes and walk along enough you'll end up doing it to lie to you yeah you know about so the eye shelf okay all of this stuff has all the eye shelf all of all of this is connected to like everything else like the raw milk guys uh this is also connected to like agartha you know like you know oh wow welcome you're talking to some real baby brains over here we don't yeah welcome well agartha agartha is wild because agartha is the opposite of of the of the flat earth theory agartha is like no the like they're like i'm not stupid the earth is round but also like the crust like that's kind of that's not the real earth right yeah yeah that's not the real earth the real earth is underneath the it's the underground earth there's a second atmosphere hollow earth yeah and it's agartha and then it got co-opted by the night by the nazis in the 30s and 40s the stories of like agartha and like it turned into like that's where the real white people that's where white people are from like it's it's yeah it's white it's the whole admiral bird expeditions are you super familiar with those marcus which yeah those expeditions did happen it's just all the lore for this comes from forum posts yeah well like yeah even the soviet the most trustworthy source yeah even the soviets were like maybe the nazis are on to something like trying to drill into the earth to get into agartha we should try to do the same thing and then they did it and they're like dude it's just hot down there it's just molten lava you know this is also like a tertiary plot to the godzilla versus kong movies um yeah i don't know if that's no nazi related or nazi it's not but it is the thing is like a lot of the a lot of all of this stuff comes from what i was trying to get at is that all this stuff is related but like the entry point of all of this is how they get you right how they how they how they trick you into thinking this like how into taking this stuff without a grain of salt with like you know full hook line and sinker believing it is they usually they usually find a blank spot in your knowledge or in like the larger gap of people's knowledge and then slip in some kind of like thing that is kind of true and they do that because they think to the the thought process that you're supposed to follow is if they didn't teach you about this can you imagine what else they didn't teach you about and that's literally once you start considering shit like that that's when they've got you hook line and sinker you know then you start saying like then you start getting into like the like how many people really died in world war ii yeah is that where you're going with that not even just that like it's even like you know like maybe like it's okay here's a great example of like rfk believes that sorry to sorry to bring that into the shop yeah that demon but he believes that the thing that's causing obesity in america is chemicals is like all of the process is that we're eating highly processed food and the fact of the matter is is that that's just incorrect what's causing obesity in america is that our food is cheap and widely available and calorie dense right and the process like the amount of processing you do to that food doesn't change how calorie dense it is i mean you can squeeze more calories into there in a smaller package but like that doesn't it doesn't make it more or less good for you right like even if you if you ate 40 eggs every day you'd still if you'd like you would still be a fat guy do you get what i'm saying like if you if you eat only protein and no salads or you drink raw milk and you have like dysentery from that it's not going to change that if they heat your milk up a little bit do you get what i'm saying like there's no difference in that it it's just that like they had they understand this is the problem that i this is where we're getting real like schizo shit right the all of all of this stuff really hinges on you not having an understanding materially of your conditions right like you because they're they're they're giving you only a part of the game they're like a lot of people can identify that like there's lots of things that we don't know that like you know like for instance uh the flat a lot of the flat earth stuff is like why does nasa have like a why is it that there are no public traded companies that go into space or why is it that like it's so difficult to go into space from a public perspective why is nasa like guarding these secrets the real the real story is that like historically it's because there's a lot of nazi scientists and they don't want to admit that stuff right they don't want to be like hey we got into space because the nazis we don't we don't want to talk about that part of our history so like what they'll do instead is they'll just kind of close everything off and it really gives a lot of leeway for people to just speculate and that's wildly dangerous it's it's more dangerous than to just be like hey yeah we goofed we did a lot of bad shit to get to get here right that's you know and i mean it seems like to me most conspiracy theories are spread and perpetrated by people just being like what i'm just like asking questions here we're just asking questions the what about is so what it's like viral what about is it's like bad it's like virulent what about ism it's it's pathological what about ism it's like it can kill you what about it's terminal what about ism is what it is but like yeah it's it's you not it's it banks on you not having an understanding of your basic material conditions or your historical context or any of the stuff that like would make it so that way someone who walked up to you and was like hey dude you know about agartha that's where the real white people are from and you're like what are you talking about man what are you what are you saying dude come on dude like you know what i mean like oh did you know that like raw milk has like 10 times more protein in it and like no it doesn't it literally doesn't it's just it's just it's got more bacteria which may have a little more protein in it because you're eating bacteria right like technically everything alive has protein i guess yeah yeah yeah like true sure yeah do you do you know about the cow thing do you know about the cow protein thing what do you know what about it oh i'm sorry that's a very abstract question cows people have it's like shocking to a lot of people but like you're you study biology right like you you have an understanding probably a better like a layperson than like people ask the question how are cows so big and they only eat grass and they have so much muscle to move them around and a lot of people don't understand the function of their four stomachs uh a lot of what like their other stomachs do is they create homes for bacteria and then the protein that they get is from the bacteria right so they supplement their protein intake with bacteria like helpful bacteria but there are guys who don't understand that and what they do instead is they take cow cow stomach lining and then grind it up and make it powder and then shoot it and they call it natural tremolone they shoot it into their body and they're like yeah and they're like this is natty tremolone and like no dude you're just shooting three pie in your stomach like or in your body like it's just you're shooting stomach intestine and you're like you're shooting intestine into your veins that's fucking it's doing nothing for you it's not you're not rewriting your dna you're not doing anything that you think that you're doing it's a thing that guys are doing now and they're like yeah it's called it's like natural it's natty tremolone and it's like no dude that's not how that works no there's yeah there's some wild people i mean yeah that people just don't understand what they're doing a lot of the time but i mean all of this all of this all of these conspiracy theories all originate from the notion the correct notion that you're being lied to all the fucking time yeah that's exactly what i'm getting at absolutely dude you're yeah so it's true like people are like yeah i'm doing this blah blah blah and it's fucking insane but also they're doing it because they're like well you know the government didn't tell me the truth about so and so and they're absolutely right because the government never fucking tells the truth and it's like you just reach a certain level of discernment where you either like can figure out how to divine the truth or you're just like well nothing's true and everything's true and you just make up yeah you just fill in the gaps with whatever crazy shit you find on fucking uh you know you do the homie method weirddude.com on marcos.org yeah yeah the homie method of um no the really like how i've come to understand all of this stuff it really is just like it's it's better to know it and then just kind of like does it sound true you know what i'm saying like really gut check it here like what if i inject like stomach protein from a from a cow into my into my body will it make me buffer no right like that that doesn't even track you know what i'm saying like that doesn't even make sense to me biologically right but i i think a bigger portion of this is just like the fact that like the u.s department of education has been like just completely gutted and destroyed yeah and that's like a continuing project uh yeah especially from like the right wing uh like republican party i mean conservative parties all around the world of course like this isn't just like an american problem where people are starting to believe wackier and just very untrue things this is like a very global problem stemming um from like probably education but also just how easy it is for misinformation to be perpetuated at this point uh online especially on places like twitter where you can just say this garbage yeah absolutely the you know the craziest so here's where we are this is a little this is kind of dark right i'm sorry i'm sorry to make this a little dark but the moment it's over for all of us the moment they start accusing the left of doing witchcraft and like doing like when they start being like yeah this this poster on twitter is doing actual rich witchcraft we're cooked because that's the like step one of the jakarta method right it's to be like yeah these guys are doing these guys are doing witchcraft and then the second step after that is like hey these guys conspired together and killed a general that's when that happens or if they you know what i'm saying then we're we're cooked we're not there yet but uh great book by the way the jakarta method yeah dismantling the education system though that's pretty that's where the step before that because that's what they did and that they did it in nicaragua they did it in um they do it everywhere like every the this the the old state apparatus of the cia and all that stuff that's what they would do they would just they would go to another country and they would completely disrupt it economically and then disrupt it educate from an educational standpoint and it would only take like five years for their like systems beyond that to just completely break down and like america has a little bit of a more tougher system and i think a lot of the dismantling of like the the educational system is because they what they want is they want essentially to have only private schools of course right yeah yeah because then they can they can always they can justify they essentially have kingmaker program now because at that point they can start teaching like uh evangelical uh well no not even or or and like they they can kind of hone they don't want they don't want true believers i know that sounds crazy but they don't want an event they they in like they don't want an evangel like an evangelical true believer to get the nuclear football because that would be bad for everybody uh-huh right like it would be bad for business long term right like right like they that's just a bad to get an actual guy who believes this shit for real is scary so like what they want is like a king program they want like a like a benny jeseret style program like where they like where they like they they hand select hey these guys are very promising and they were educated in a specific and they went through these specific schools i think that we can place them here you know and i what i mean by they what i'm saying they i don't know i'm not talking about like a like an apparatus in any particular sense i mean like rich yeah yeah that's not i'm not talking about those guys right those guys like yeah that's not that's not where i'm coming from where i'm coming from is more like it's the powers that be it's it's the people that have money it's the people that have always had money the it's the old money of the old families like it's it's like the skull and bones freaks it's those people no it's it's it's anyone who has business concerns that's the level that i'm you know what i'm saying when a guy's like yeah he's from a concern when you bring up when you say concern instead of telling someone what your business is that's that's who i'm talking about like oh what do you like i have a shipping concern out of missoula like oh what the fuck like that's that's a level of rich guy that most people don't know right right and and so like the like man all of this stuff goes back to like i'm sorry i've taken this over and gone completely schizophrenic but like all of this goes back to like the nazis because the nazis how they got the like waffen guys how they like here's how the nazis work right they realized that they couldn't they couldn't really like only have six foot five like blonde hair blue-eyed guys in their army because there wasn't enough of them they were like hey listen there's not enough of these guys to have a whole army of them so what they did was they opened it up to the waffen which were like guys that were like five two and you know kind maybe you're like you slavic right and that's that's if you will yeah me yeah me essentially right but yeah they just guys that weren't part of the aryan what they considered aryan they had the waffen ss and how they got those guys to comply as they did this especially like in belarus and like russia what they sold them on instead of like telling the like what the nordic vision of like they were essentially like what they're telling german soldiers in the german ss what they were telling those guys was that like yeah you guys are going to be business owners we're going to install you in the state it's going to be kind of like you guys are always going to have a job no matter what but what they told the like waffen guys and like belarus and all that stuff they're like we're returning to feudal feud uh to feudalism and you guys are going to be errant knights and you guys are going to ride around in the countryside and have maidens and shit and those guys were like fuck yeah dude sign me up right and like i'm not i'm not even joking but like then they just really lead into that occult occultist view of like because there are some guys who are like no i'm too smart i don't want to be a knight that sounds like hard work and they're like well then you could be a wizard those guys were like dude you know what now you're speaking my language and that's literally how the occultism got into nazis so funny that you mentioned the nazis so i'm skipping ahead on this insanely long post just a little bit um so uh this this person continues the wiki antarctic treaty article doesn't mention the lands that are that were claimed for germany by hitler in 1939 that were beyond the ice walls called new schwaben land now renamed new swabia did you know that there are lands beyond the arctic wall claimed by seven countries but you'll never be allowed to see them it was during hitler's many trips to the antarctic prior to world war ii that he made contact with the highly advanced breakaway group known as the thule society also known as the black sun society that operates either under the ice or beyond the dome walls where he was given advanced anti-gravity technology that led to the first fighter planes made out of steel steel can't float on air currents folks that's literally not possible then later flying discs first known as the nazi bell and later as foo fighters that are able to hover fly and translocate instantly using scalar mapping and temporal displacement technology prior to world war ii hitler secretly already had this technology in development and ironed out during the war while america was still using archaic forms of air weaponry so you know he he gets into this like very like hitler mysticism nazi mysticism yeah all this stuff goes it really like we should link this through i mean should we link this thread in the show then so people can delve into this yeah well because this goes on read all this like you are um becoming an information and yeah you're gonna have to start putting your hair into a ponytail and you're gonna have to look like the comic book guy from the simpsons but this is this is part of the process because there's so much here like i've only read maybe one like one fifth of everything in this thread and i don't think we'll get to all of that in this episode but it's like this kind of shit it starts with like you know oh there's lands beyond the ice wall that's like no it starts we can't so i know invariably what's going to happen here is yeah we'll have it i'm not complaining by the way i love this kind of interaction with it with our audience but yeah we talk about something for like an hour that like other podcasts or any kind of books have been written about this there are 10 part series on conspiracy podcasts about this kind of stuff so we'll get some people that are going to like oh you need to talk about like the the uranus people who have pink skin and white eyes which is a real thing by the way um that real thing as in part of this theory not real as in it's no they're real no no they're no they're real um just just understand guys this is so dense that we are not going to but we could talk about this marcus how many hours of content do you think we could do just on the ice wall dude we're like we did what we're doing the chiro miser stuff we're only like we're done with two three sessions and we're not even scratching what we're trying to talk about we've done like two intros so far we've talked yeah it's impossible to talk about this stuff because it's all you would need you would need two things to really understand this one is like you need to you need to have like an advanced case of schizophrenia and to like a pretty good grasp of like the 20 the last i want to say 100 years of history of like clandestine operation history then if you have both of those things you can truly fully begin to understand what's going on here you can truly become an information pimp yeah truly but until then you don't you don't know what the hell is going to know it's it like the nazi connection with all of this stuff that all right wing propaganda eventually starts and ends in mysticism absolutely and the reason why that is is because i hate right wing shit right like conservative right wing mindset is baby brain right you literally your brain you have the brain of a baby right you don't you are baby brain you they stopped growing at eight years old no just like because you have an addiction to narrative do you know what i'm saying absolutely like things need to happen for a reason things can't just happen and it has to make sense yeah yeah all the operators have to have a specific they have to they have to they have to be connected to the same people they all have to know the plan going into it there needs to be a plan all of that yeah yeah like and you know what i'm saying there and like the thing is is that like not to say that the left doesn't have this kind of baby brain stuff too because there is a baby brain amongst the left and it's a different it's what yeah it's what i do which is like saying the cia did most of it but i'm backing it up by like you know what i'm saying historical documents yeah i'm backing it up by like watching c-span for hours on end you know this is a different but like what i'm getting at is that like you have to understand that like you won't have answers that things just won't make sense sometimes and that the moment you have a grand unified theory about something you've you've goofed you fucked up see this is like this is why i think that burn after reading that that coen brothers movie is like my ur text of like yes of like what if you've never seen that you should by the way but it's like essentially a bunch of imbeciles coen brothers movies so you know what kind of imbecile you're dealing with is like your protagonist they write the most important part of the movie it's about intelligence operatives just letting shit fall into the wrong hands yeah and the wrong hands happen to be a bunch of fucking morons and the last night the last like scene of the movie is a debrief on it with jk simmons and jk simmons they're like what so what does this all mean and he's like fuck if i know and that's the end of the movie yeah what did we learn he asked him what did we learn and he goes fuck if i know and then that's how they end it it's great yeah but yeah that's legitimately a lot of that stuff is how like the mk ultra stuff right like do you know how we even know about mk ultra uh government uh declassification i think no it was no no no no not at all uh dumber than that yeah alan alan dulles like destroyed all of the files but they misfiled one set of documents and sent it to a different warehouse and then like years later like we did crimes receipts that they just yes i love that's my favorite kind of like finding out about information is just like a oops here's the crimes we did and now everyone knows what happened was like they it was like a secretary was just for it was for a discovery case and she was just like blindly just copy like xeroxing everything and shipping it to the to the lawyer and it had nothing to do with like discovering mk ultra it had something it was like a libel case or something and this this like poor lawyer is like reading these like what the the government did what what the fuck what does this have to do with my case you're just like literally that's literally how it went down and it's just it's fascinating to me that like but yeah like the going getting back to it's all narrative addiction you have an addiction to narrative things these things have to make sense to you and like beyond that there's like this is like the further level of baby brain is that you don't want to think about it so you'll find someone that sounds like they know what they're talking about and you'll just trust them blindly right right and like that's your narrative addiction is so removed it's so like abstracted that you don't even need it to make sense it just needs to make sense to the guy who's telling you that it makes sense right you know and like that's if you if you have a strong worldview this the strength of your worldview should be that like i don't know shit and i probably never will that's the strongest world that's how i can have yeah like like you get to a certain point usually if for me it was like my early to mid 20s where i'm like i don't know anything who who knows liberating to like you go through this i don't know you guys did maybe i don't or not but i went through a phase of like discovering the world and i was like oh my god i'm the one i alone know the secret truth of the world for like 18 months and i was like oh actually i'm stupid as fuck and it's so liberating to not know how things actually work no that's that's how i was when i was younger and then like yeah like early 20s mid 20s yeah that's exactly the same path i went on where i was like i how i'm never gonna know i'm stupid carl marx me at like 19 like oh so fucking insufferable my my problem was that like i've always been willfully ignorant about things like on purpose like i remember people would be like have you read the communist manifesto and i'm like no fuck that shit no oh you read that's how most people in this world think though like yeah like they're like oh you you want me to read this like 10 like 10 line document oh that's kind of a big ask i don't know the thing that the thing that really opened up the world to me like legitimately that stopped me from being one of these guys like here's the thing right i remember getting into debates in my early 20s with people online especially like in facebook people be like oh you haven't read the communist manifesto blah blah i'm like you want me to read a book that lets me know that the rich get richer and the poor get poor like i know this dog right like i don't why would i need to read a book that tells me that but i already know this is crazy it's crazy you know what i'm saying i'm gonna say something kind of controversial on here on this pod and i might get yelled at but there's also i just think not the condensate manifesto is very different than like capital um yeah does capital is different yeah because it tells you exactly how you're getting like more and there's like scholars that read this book throughout their entire lives again and give these books rather these books again and again and again they dedicate their lives to reading this book and understanding it and talking to other nerds who read this book for their entire lives and they interpret it and stuff i just don't know if i see like if you want to read it do it i've read it but like i don't know how much i see the utility of like just a normal if you're not like a scholarly man like if you're kind of dumb i don't know like at what point you need to really read capital do you this is here's okay check this out i started reading all of these books so that i could dunk on nerds more effectively what happened was like literally all of this stuff comes from like in the in like 2007 facebook is like kind of taking off yeah and like the the the facebook pages start taking off this was like the ape if you were an insufferable fucking nerd about politics this was the golden age yes oh yeah and so i was i was big in facebook politics when i was like 16 yeah so i was going on there and i was just getting these wall of text memes and i was like this isn't funny what the fuck and then i would look under and people like haha so true and i'm like what the fuck is it talking about reduce all this into like soy jacks yeah yeah and i was like what the fuck are they what is this what why is it funny and it was infuriating to me that i didn't get the joke so i was like okay well now i gotta read that and like i you got through a fucking rocky for training montage of reading books to destroy words online dude i read and like the thing the worst part about this is that like i've i have a different history of reading like so for me the most revolutionary book you can read right now like you can just go out you can get it it's fucking it's on kindle if you want to audiobook it solo dad brother right if you've ever it's a book about it's a book written in prison by a guy who was going to prison and like or he was in prison and it's like about the horror of like being like a captive in america like in america like and it explains like the rate like the racial injustices that you that you feel being a black man in america but not even like how just like in general the cage of like racism is caging all of us and beyond that like it there's an industrial aspect to it where like there's a there's a paid aspect people get money to to live like this and like that to me was my and like that's how i came to like i guess have a left you know left-leaning worldview was reading that book when i was like 12 because my dad was like a prison guy like my dad like both simultaneously loved prison and hate i don't know it doesn't make any sense but you know like from him so by the time that i got to like nerds talking about like the communist manifesto or like das capital or like bread and circus or not bread and circuses uh bread and roses like um or the conquest the conquest of bread right like yeah yeah uh all of these books i remember like reading them and being like wait you guys didn't know this already right yeah see i'm i'm i'm a person who like if you try and make me read theory my fucking eyes glaze over but if you put it if it's like ursula k le guinn i'm so oh yeah so yeah if so put it make it an allegory that's in outer space and i will digest that shit so hard and then later if you're like if you're like by the way that's about communism i'm like oh fuck do you know about do you know about bio do you know about biocosm like biocosmism do you know about that biocosm that's like right up your alley so the soviets back in the day there was like a group of soviets that decided that like stalin was a little bit too oppressive for them so they couldn't be as utopian as they wanted to be so they decided to write science fiction about like utopias about like soviet style utopias like the world being a better place like we've we've and like one of them is that like they completely abolished death like they figured out no one has to die anymore so like there's a book like there's a pretty famous book i can't remember the name of it but like in the book they're talking about like the validity of bringing back monsters like people like like hitler and all that shit and like is it worth it is it worth like bringing them back to life to give them a second chance at life even though like there's this is really fascinating like really big and the thing was the soviets like stalin especially was like oh these fucking nerds talking about nerd shit yeah i don't right but it was it was wildly effective for like in non-communist countries because like it was science fiction about it's essentially biocosmism is how star trek got like gene roddenberry got inspired to make star trek right which is like the the space luxury communism like it it started with the soviets being like listen if we try and talk about like you know medical advancements and stuff there's a chance that it might step on a concern stalin might have and he might squash us but if we start talking about like curing death and shit he's not going to do anything about it and they were right they were 1000 right and so i i think what this goes to uh kaleb go on and then i'll i'll i was just gonna say like how much of stuff like uh disco elysium which is beloved by all leftists of all stripes basically is like i mean there's a substantial amount of just like the frankfurt school in that game that's kind of like if you've played it and have read those books it's like oh yeah that's like there's like lines from these characters that are from like lifted from the frankfurt school so there's it's interesting how that works i think that that is like another thing a very new example of of like i personally i'll i'll have take the hot take where i think capital and the communist manifesto are can be useful things to read but it has it can have its limits based on the audience and i think that like you brought up marcos the the soviet different soviet era propaganda like you do you need different lanes of propaganda to reach different people like capital is good for a certain type of person where like different sorts of like left-leaning propaganda and i don't use i'm not saying propaganda in a bad like as a bad thing i think there is good forms of propaganda um like we call it lord now it's lord lord like it just depends on the audience and who you're trying to reach and like it's not a one-size-fits-all sort of situation in terms of how different things can reach audiences you know clear about when i was making that criticism of capital specifically is like having read that one of the biggest takeaways i had is like so many of the people in my life could benefit from like socialism but should never read this book there's nothing there's no way that's kind of where i was coming from okay so i have the i knew you were i just wanted to be like yeah because i like i think that's the discussion we were having is like different forms of talking about this is what's important it's there's not a one solution the thing that really solidified my worldview and the reason why i am the way i am and the reason why i figured out a way to make schizophrenia work for me is uh is is morrowind lore right it literally morrowind lore saved my life the actual lore of the game morrowind the elder scrolls 3 morrowind saved my life i okay we got right it's my bible it's i'm not even i've dedicated my life to it dude oh my god it like the the long and short of it is that like essentially in in morrowind the it revolves around a concept called kim or chim depending on who says it but like the idea is that like you achieve so much in your life that you eventually like move up and like go beyond and you meet the godhead like and the godhead looks at you and says like hey you've done a lot of cool shit but you're not real i'm like i'm dreaming you everything you i did it i i actually did all the stuff that you did and here's all the proof that you need and to achieve kim all you have to do is be like hey listen you're the godhead sure i might be your dream but also i'm real like listen i'm real it doesn't even matter i know that i'm not real but i am real i'm a real person i've done enough i've didn't i've i've experienced enough things i am real i'm also you're not part of i'm not part of you you're part of me so being able to flip it back on like the godhead then you like achieve this concept called kim and you get sent back to like earth or or like ward the world and then once you're there you can remake it in any image that you want that quote and you am i a man dreaming i'm a butterfly or am i a butterfly dreaming lousy yeah lousy or lousy i think it's loud i think it's lousy i saw it in chrono trigger the video game i don't know yeah yeah yeah am i am i a homie dreaming yeah am i a homie dreaming is a butterfly or am i the butterfly dreaming he's a homie right but no i think like the like the the idea behind that right is like when you get back sent back to earth the people who achieve kim they have the ability to change the world however they want and like nine times out of ten they don't change anything and the reason why is because they've become they've become they've accepted they've completed like no this was what made me this so like i right absolutely that's like so real i mean not not even in like a mystic sense that's even so real in like a light like a real life experience sense yeah yeah any aspect of your past you will be a different person exactly and like to me the like really it really did help me with like you know growing when i was younger i was like experiencing bad like really bad hallucinations like all the time and i'd like if you talked anytime you would bring it up to like a to a psychiatrist or psych psych psychotherapist the first thing they would do is like okay cool we're gonna up your risper doll you're like come on man i don't want to do that that's i don't want to be a vegetable i want others i want to live life so like learning to accept that they may or may not be real but it doesn't matter really did change how i like my relationship to that kind of stuff which is what got me interested in like it made me really good at being skeptical as shit without being skeptical do you know what i'm saying without being like no you might be right agartha might be real but like we're not there right we're not like you got directions yeah you gotta you got directions to agartha because until until then i don't know what you're talking about so i think i think we're wrapping down but i do want to read just one more section from this post yeah there's also uh one thing that i think is critical after that that we have to talk about i'm sorry oh absolutely i wasn't sure if we were gonna get to that i i'm so okay we have to get to that too so we'll we'll go yeah we'll we'll talk about that too thank god um so this is the last segment from this post and then you can we'll link it you can read through it yourself because there's just so much here and i'm sure there's so much we didn't even touch like the the expanded map that i found in this reply is just incredible oh my it's so good i want to live in that world um so so this this last little segment elon's rockets that are i believe attempting to show people with their own eyes they live under a dome are like massive rpgs that explode on contact then explodes again and again as it keeps pushing deeper maybe he wants to break through but nonetheless that's what you're seeing next time you checked that spot it would be perfectly sealed and smooth again on my wall you will find a post with an image that appears like there was a huge crack in the dome refracting light and a rainbow hue so he's basically like implementing elon musk into this theory like i'm assuming this is a newer development in this theory like elon musk knows about this and he's trying to show the world that we live in this dome that's not new by the way they've been talking ever since space ever since he became part of spacex they had been like when he put the car in space they were saying that that was like a plot to show that the earth is actually flat yeah there's a lot of like shit behind that like yeah that's a whole other hour that's an entire other hour and then actually before we get to the other thing we're going to talk about i'm just going to read some of the outer outer ice walls so there's as far as i'm aware just the two ice walls all the way down frankly yeah endless ice walls so there's a continent called greater lumeria there's one called the sky the lemarian wars the lemarian time war i just activated more schizzo there's one called asgard with the walls of asgard beyond that valhalla there's another one called well drum another one called polybius another one called the dracanic isles another one called aurora morris the garden isles moo there's just there's countless of other continents beyond the first ice wall this is beyond the second ice wall like on some real shit how do they how does this guy know i don't know but i believe it this is some cool shit i'm not kidding it's just genuine all this is just like arg forum posts from since like 2002 or something yeah with like probably some alternative agenda like shifting people to this like schizophrenic right-wing ideology is like always a lot of that always plays an element sure i found uh this is a few years ago and i never did anything with it but i found like a very small community of guys who believe in something called like like spectral time vortexes or i don't know how to explain it it's it's like it has something to do with ghosts and like famous people but like if you dig far enough about it it's literally an arg from nine from a nine inch nails album that they like have completely made a mythology and build into now and they believe it unironically that's cool that's like yeah i think it's a show in some ways of just like yeah dudes rocking online and finding yeah just you know ways to connect with each other to continue rocking yeah it really is cool like these guys are probably they all have schizophrenia now but like they're really they're really tight it's funny to think about that it's like they're just like out there like this this guy is probably like a pepsi delivery driver and one of them's an accountant like they're just for sure one of these guys one of these one of them is a mailman yeah all i know is that this is some cool shit i believe it uh now well you know what one of them is by the way one of them we found out is actually um a crown prince of katar uh yes so you guys are familiar know this uh uh you know maverick my friend yes yeah did you see we talk about him a little bit on the show if you're if you're a long-time listener we've talked about maverick a couple of times yeah maverick is one of those people that just believes in like every so elite gender inversion is so like in the trend uh we did it with ivy is our is our transvestigation episode um we're like there's a group of people that believe just like literally every celebrity is they call them gender diverse but essentially they're trans um everyone even donald trump and and which is very funny i believe that one actually i yeah he's got t-boy swag i'm not gonna lie he's got so maverick is is an interesting character in that like he posts all day every day about like you know donald trump is is secretly uh like about was was born a woman or is is a gender invert and taylor swift i mean like side-by-side photos like pictures with like outlines like john madden doing the x and o's on like their back line and stuff like that you know what i mean just all day every day but like some of my like there's uh uh becca who was in our um our uh live stream for palestine was uh they and i have been been big maverick heads for a few years now and like we would notice some trends about maverick that i always thought were very interesting and that like randomly he would between breaks of like posting his his satanic gender inversion stuff and the mud floods and everything he would post like a picture of like a rolls royce and it's like that's okay you're just lying like you're just whatever um then he would post like a video of like in a private jet or something like that and i kept trying for like a year i've been trying to like reverse search all these photos to prove that he was like stealing them from like some some other place on the internet and i never could ever well he just self-identified he genuinely is a qatari royalty and he's like he's got his own wikipedia page he is like so he says he's got like all these degrees he's an engineer and a cardiologist and all that stuff well yeah that's true actually he's just like he just is he is flying around on these private jets he actually does have his own wikipedia page he actually is has more money than god and he has i uh in his wikipedia page you can see like a list of the cars that he owns and i cross-referenced that to like my my schizophrenic maverick album of like car pictures that he's posted and stuff and it's those are his cars that's him he genuinely has his own wikipedia page and that's how he spends all day is just posting that donald trump was born a woman or cia that's this is cia shit this is what i'm not joking they're they're doing like they're doing cointelpro operation chaos type level shit where they're like getting people they're making people online stupider yeah you know i'm saying mormons it used to be that they would they would send they would send a bunch of like it used to be all of these organizations were catholic right and they would do catholic shit by like we're doing pedophile we're doing like pedophile uh groups and and like network and then you know we'll kidnap a guy and we're working with the mob we do that kind of stuff but then the mormons took over and they're like what we're gonna do is we're gonna bully teenagers we're gonna make them we're gonna bully teenagers we're gonna make them think that they're that everything is wrong and they look look where we are look yeah look at what i'm saying like yeah no it's working it's coming to fruition yeah it's it's insane i'm not even surprised that that this dude is like this royalty like like when when i saw that i i like burst out laughing because it's like what like you expect these people to just be like people living in the hills in like west virginia no the hapsburgs were part of the p2 masonic lodge like this is not like literally like the guys who were like hey you know that uh did you know that like misogy or miscegenation is like a disease and can kill you people who are putting out that kind of like misinformation and shit in the like fucking early 20th century and all that they those guys were literally hapsburgs like they were related to the like they had the jaw and everything and they were hanging out in the in the masonic lodge like i'm not joking like this stuff is it's it's his tale as old as time it doesn't even if you were to tell me he's like oh he's a kurdish you know uh administrator of the public transportation like no yeah dude i get 1000 like you know that makes sense to me you know every time every time you're on here it's like this is this is i feel like the trajectory of every fucking marcos conversation it starts okay but i'm just going to i'm i am going to map a conversation with marcos okay it starts with the fucking ice wall yeah it goes to um to communist literature you always come up with you're always citing theory always midway through and i'm just like where the fuck did that come from and then we end with something completely incomprehensible to me like the p2 masonic lodge what you're saying now is not english as far as i'm concerned i love you for this and i'm so glad that we get to have you on the show okay dude it's it's history dude it like i'm not even making that up like the p2 masonic lodge is it's italian history i believe you with i believe you but that doesn't mean that you are not like i know i'm you are a you are the living embodiment of a wall of a corkboard with red string all over it that's like i know you're personification of that you're our own qatar royalty yeah i'm the worst person to get stuck at a bus stop right that like i because i i believe that too yeah yeah you you will be like why what the fuck was that guy talking about for the like we were on a bus ride it was like a five minute bus ride but i feel 10 years older like yeah my bad dog right okay um can we use that as a segue to to pitch the new show absolutely okay uh marcus and i it's a western kabuki patreon exclusive the cairo mindset um we're going to be talking about this kind of thing every episode it's going to be a little more structured we're trying it's so hard we're trying very hard to be structured and um you're going to learn some things i think uh because you know it's a little more predicated in reality than maybe the ice walls but you know it's all going to tie in i think i'm more or less offering i've been trying to like sum it up because like my girlfriend has been like why are you watching old white guys in suits all day i'm like listen hey that's don't worry about that kind of stuff right like this this doesn't concern you but like the reality of what i'm trying to do is i think i'm trying to offer a history of america that's like the a clandestine history of america i'm trying to offer you a perspective of understanding what's going on like what is like all of these like conspiracy theories and then blow them up a little bit further out like i don't know one of the crazy ones i don't know if that i that i recently fell into was the roswell new mexico yes yes that's good we have to do that roswell episode okay so yeah we're definitely gonna do roswell episode but like i'm i wanted this was a crazy one some people think that the grays and like the pictures of the of like dude the crop the crash site yeah yeah they they think that that was a government cover-up not to like cover up the fact that there was aliens there but to cover up the fact that they like poisoned the groundwater and gave a ton of like immigrant and like uh native american children um hydrocephalitis and they were like look at these aliens and they're like no dude those are children like those are deformed oh wow oh my god so like really dark horrific shit but like conspiracy theorists took that hook line and sinker and then spread it and then everyone now believe you know what i'm saying like the history of it is is now this like you there's no way to get a direct history about it it's all like whispers it's like a people's history of the united states show except if you were like schizophrenic yeah yeah so if you liked if you liked the sound of that if you liked this episode i think that's going to be a lot of in the same vein like of what the chiral mindset on on our patreon is going to be about and i'm really looking forward to it too yeah this is this is i i want to become an information pimp i need to i need to see the chiral chiral uh vectors i'm growing my i'm growing my hair out so i can really get into the information pimp yeah do lifestyle i am like you you're going to start going bald and you're going to have to put it into a ponytail and that's that's just part of the process don't worry i already tent my fingers you can't see them but every time i'm talking just imagine my fingers being like yeah yeah just doing this the entire time you have to get like a 3xl cardigan that's just way too big i'm wearing one right now absolutely dude it just just tent my fingers oh my god i think that we'll announce it separately but we've probably by the time you're hearing this if you haven't heard it will have announced it but um first live show uh western kabuki live at the lincoln lodge in chicago illinois
