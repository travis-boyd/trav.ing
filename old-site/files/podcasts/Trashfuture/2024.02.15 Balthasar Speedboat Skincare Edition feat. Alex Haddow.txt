128.22 144.04 SPEAKER_04  great thing is you know not only getting a clifford you might get a claim on the throne of pomerania exactly yeah yeah well no that's ruled by very small dogs uh-huh and also was actually never hapsburg territory fair enough um yeah more like a southern germany thing okay it was a whole thing
144.04 157.46 SPEAKER_03  well they were imperially in control of it but never really directly you know yeah you don't um you don't often get a rescue clifford because they're so they're so big that if they if the rspca gets them they just have to humanely destroy them yeah in an aircraft they've not got a cave
157.46 178.90 SPEAKER_04  it's like it's like one of those couches that you can't move out of a flat that has to just be chainsaw yeah weirdly they called the saudi ambassador to try to help out with that calling your landlord and being like yeah what's your pet's policy you've got like a 14 foot high dog what's your pet's what's your pet's policy and also what is your large rubbish disposal policy

261.28 272.10 SPEAKER_04  yeah yeah i'm ready yeah sorry do you know jack whitehall was in the clifford the big red dog movie i didn't know that it was a film 2021 live action fantasy comedy film directed by walt becker
272.10 278.60 SPEAKER_01  yeah he was the back half what hasn't jack whitehall been in and that relates to all instagram
278.60 285.14 SPEAKER_04  models as well yeah yeah does he have a reputation as a something of a sex a sex i think he's he's
285.14 289.50 SPEAKER_03  um been quite the swordsman in his time he's got that he's got that jimmy neutron hair women
289.50 295.06 SPEAKER_01  love that yeah he's got had a child now though he's settled down oh his latest show i think was
295.06 306.80 SPEAKER_03  called settled down yeah well i mean always a route one guy jack whitehall like let's not let's not beat around the bush yeah oh yeah i have a question go on what's route one mean like uh
306.80 316.66 SPEAKER_04  straight down the line just like no no subtlety just you're not referring to like a particular like stretch of road with sort of very obvious comedy clubs on it another thing um so
316.66 322.62 SPEAKER_03  there's all these like fucking like incredibly northern comedy clubs and they're all like on
322.62 328.76 SPEAKER_01  the m1 yeah that's always like an m1 comic where i tonight route one oh my god i did sort of think
328.76 334.54 SPEAKER_04  that's what you meant for a second like that there is like a way to drive to be fair my friend
334.54 356.72 SPEAKER_01  so jamie allerton uh he shouts out a shout out to jamie allerton himself exactly also comedian a man who sleeps on your dog as i recall he sleeps on my dog yes um a few days a few days a month that sounds like a sex thing jack whitehall's always complaining about it he calls route one uh he's he says he's very a to b which actually sounds like it could be your
356.72 363.80 SPEAKER_03  theory as well and that sounds like an auto trader list yeah i think the 2004 voxel astra it'll get
363.80 374.88 SPEAKER_04  you from a to b i quite like a to b is one of the comedy clubs on route one you know yes i like that it's like i have a child my life is worse now thank you yeah it's one of those things where you can guess
374.88 385.92 SPEAKER_01  the punchline or the direction they're going in would you say that yeah sort of it yeah there's a lot of that or somebody that even now in the year of our lord 2024 is doing a bit about how
385.92 428.26 SPEAKER_03  there's different milks and you're like oh yeah different there are quite a few my wife's had a kid the size of her now yeah she's like clifford turned her into the sofa i've been sitting on her these these new age pregnancy manuals yeah what are they like it's one option i like the idea of doing a really high budget clifford the big red dog movie but where clifford is like a pantomime horse like it's just two guys everything else about the movie is like very like a24 it's like you know wait it's a24 so it's slightly terrifying uh-huh so everyone's terrified of the pantomime horse dog very cool what's it what's clifford a metaphor for like capitalism yeah that's right
428.26 458.42 SPEAKER_04  that's right yeah disputes with your landlord yeah yeah he's a he's a metaphor for landlordism and he's the big red dog that has to live in your house and like takes up a huge amount of space um but you kind of have to like making this work acknowledge and and and like him and no this is but this is too high concept for a24 because a24 usually it's like um because what i'm describing is a kind of a wacky film essentially ah that was quite wacky i was just thinking about clifford the big red dog
458.42 463.36 SPEAKER_01  and he got a bit scared ah it's too big i feel like you guys know quite a lot about clifford the
463.36 475.86 SPEAKER_04  big red dog sorry did you not get the google dog sorry i didn't get the show notes um okay i guess i'll just have to do some research on the fly as to what clifford the big red dog is doing now
475.86 482.12 SPEAKER_01  how old is it's a very old name for a young dog isn't it clifford yeah i think that the myth
482.12 486.70 SPEAKER_03  of clifford the big red dog has been around for a while sort of an oral tradition you know since
486.70 498.16 SPEAKER_04  the days of homeric greece people have talked about the big red dog with the um with the the troy cycle we only have two of the poems it's actually one of the lost i see yeah sing muses
498.16 503.92 SPEAKER_01  of the smell of the big red dog so the black black dog is depression uh-huh yeah red dog is
503.92 514.28 SPEAKER_03  landlordism yeah sorry yeah landlordism well then you'd get you'd get sued by alexandra burke because she invented the phrase the big red dog in the room oh my god that was incredible
514.28 530.62 SPEAKER_01  i knew that riley would be puzzled by that okay riley this was one of the biggest sort of niche moments of recent pop culture history would you say yeah it's one of the biggest niche moments of all of the small moments because i feel like if you know you love it this this falls into the
530.62 542.56 SPEAKER_03  category of things that people on gay twitter are obsessed with yeah i would say um alexandra burke is someone who won the x factor in like the late 2000s yeah maybe like 2010 what a classic
542.56 549.46 SPEAKER_04  type of person though is like on reality tv in 2009 yeah great probably has made her life's earnings
549.46 555.50 SPEAKER_03  yeah like what if there was another leona lewis like she's the answer exactly yeah yeah yeah precisely
555.50 566.38 SPEAKER_01  and she did she did a duet with beyonce in the final um and she had a pretty good voice out of alexandra burke and then when beyonce started singing it was like oh oh yeah that's why you're
566.38 573.20 SPEAKER_04  in you got here through a show rather than sort of yeah yeah uh-huh but alexandra burke fairly
573.20 582.76 SPEAKER_01  recently last few years yeah yeah was on a was on like a morning show like this morning or something like that with the lorraine or something like that and um she was i think she was talking about
582.76 591.30 SPEAKER_03  something completely arbitrary she's got hasn't she got a song called elephant in the room oh has she i think that might be it yeah and she was explaining why she called the song that yeah and
591.30 601.78 SPEAKER_01  she essentially um she said oh it's called elephant in the room because it's this phrase they have over in the states i actually learned it there no no no she claimed to have invented it that was the claim
601.78 608.82 SPEAKER_03  she was like it's a phrase that i came up with no i mean i imagine i imagine that there would have
608.82 612.94 SPEAKER_04  been a quite unspoken implication when she said that that no one really wanted to acknowledge
612.94 625.60 SPEAKER_01  the presenters were very awkward nicer the presenters were very awkward weren't they because they obviously knew that alexandra burke had not in fact yeah invented the phrase elephant in the room
625.60 630.72 SPEAKER_03  so well because imagine if there was an elephant in the room you know you'd want to talk about it
630.72 634.24 SPEAKER_01  yeah and then she proceeded to like sort of quite literally talk about the phrase and the presenters
634.24 651.70 SPEAKER_04  were like um it's also not one of those phrases that just sort of originated from nowhere like it has a point of origin does it yeah i just assumed it was something it's from a russian fable really yeah it's from a russian fable when you have elephant in room you feed it dried squid and give it beer
651.70 658.66 SPEAKER_03  until it eventually leaves you film it on camera phone you say choy bled хорош if it's there
658.66 667.10 SPEAKER_01  you marry elephant elephant is wife slimmer than my wife actually i use her as sofa
667.10 675.88 SPEAKER_04  elephant easier to clean than dog dog yes more cozy elephant wipe clean i perform at comedy club

693.12 697.56 SPEAKER_04  is political correctness gone mad
697.56 707.52 SPEAKER_03  fuck have we told you the political correctness gone mad story i don't care if we've told this on the show before we're doing it again no so you may or may not know this but i invented the phrase
707.52 712.36 SPEAKER_01  the political correctness gone mad and you've done a song about it yeah that's right yeah basically
712.36 718.98 SPEAKER_03  years ago at the edinburgh fringe i think 2018 um i was doing a mixed bill i have never laughed harder
718.98 725.56 SPEAKER_04  at live comedy than what we are about to hear this is the hardest i have ever laughed is this when you
725.56 731.04 SPEAKER_01  had a weird russian guy in the audience uh not in the audience he was on stage that's where you want
731.04 796.50 SPEAKER_03  a weird russian guy please tell the story again it's insane so yeah so when i was doing the mixed bill with the with the two russian guys yeah they had without my say so booked this other russian dude who happened to be in town because they were like oh he wants he wants to have a go this guy i knew him because he was a promoter from this shit town in russia called vologda and i'm like and not only is he not funny in russian but also he cannot speak english and then they were like it'll be fine he said he's had his jokes translated i'm like he's had them translated and they were like and i was like dude we've got to cancel this like you can't they're like he's doing five it'll be fine and i'm like it won't be he's reading them off of a piece of paper yeah they've got an auto queue um and so then they're like okay well here's a compromise it would be so rude to cancel him because he's a promotion he does book us so what we'll do is you just sit down with him for like half an hour before the show and just like approve his jokes and just like tidy it up and i'm like okay whatever so he turns up sense check yeah he's got these like reams of paper and he's like learned the stuff like by rote basically because he'd got some guy in his town to translate them but who normally does like legal documents you are dancing
796.50 806.32 SPEAKER_04  queen young and lean only 17 perfect age for marriage um clifford big red dog in house couch

859.78 889.30 SPEAKER_03  wallet in his hand not in his pocket yeah um great god now that's salesmanship on the pod right there you're getting value for money here hogs um so yeah basically he turns up with these like reams of paper from this translator and the translation of the jokes is mental like it's like it's switching between british and american english mid-sentence it's like using like completely out of register words like it will use like some five syllable technical word and then like poo poo in the same you know i mean it's like it's all over the place like it's like 15 different people wrote
889.30 894.68 SPEAKER_01  this one line at a time i would be so excited to see this and terrified at the same time yeah i was
894.68 937.54 SPEAKER_03  kind of like oh fuck so i'm going through it and the sort of the main routine of this five minute set was him talking about his seven-year-old daughter and he's talking about how his seven-year-old daughter has a boyfriend and he had this bit where it was like uh and i cannot kill him or even hurt him and then i was like okay at this point you should say it's political correctness gone mad and he was like what does mean i'm like doesn't matter what it means just say it yeah and then so the show happens he's on in the middle so it's like maybe it's been going for like half an hour the show is going well so the audience are kind of like they're trusting the show at this point yeah he goes on and for the first like two minutes he's like barely making sense like he's stumbling through his words so much but people are laughing because the show has been good enough that they think it's a bit
937.54 943.34 SPEAKER_01  yeah like that he's doing some kind of kaufman type and you're like soon the veil will fall exactly
943.34 970.28 SPEAKER_03  and then by about minute three people are starting to be like oh no this guy actually just can't speak english oh shit and then but then this one bit he manages to nail where he's like my daughter has boyfriend she's seven but it's not fair i cannot kill him or even hurt him and then there's like a pause and he goes it is political correctness gone mad i have never seen anything crushed so hard in my life like the sheer shock on the face to do it is riley was stood behind me and he's just like
970.28 976.12 SPEAKER_04  cannot breathe like bent double like falling around the place i will i will listen to this

1304.32 1316.04 SPEAKER_03  like impression of any british indie guitar band from the 2000s it was because when you said stingy the stingy mud mask like a band called stingy mud mask yeah if you ever if you ever look at um
1316.04 1335.42 SPEAKER_01  josh weller's sketches he's got a great one about uh you know fake indie band names but they're so accurate we're stingy mud mask and this is travel and tension we smoke fags we're from spain all those sort of names and then steve lemak even commented on his thing saying we would have definitely had we're from spain in the live lounge like they were all called like i remember i
1335.42 1349.02 SPEAKER_03  actually i used to follow on my space back in the day a band that were actually called we smoke thanks was a real was a real band and they were always getting shit from americans who were like this is disgusting homophobia and then they thought that band was like we kill gay people
1349.02 1362.24 SPEAKER_01  that's a much more of a norwegian vibe yeah and they and they they um apparently had to stop uh hang on this they got like a really redneck following in the states of people that thought
1362.24 1395.86 SPEAKER_04  it was but so they would go to the show having not heard the show and then they'd be like can't wait for some you know george bush era you know homophobia why would they call it george bush era it's now yeah can't wait for some homophobia the iraq war is cool yeah the iraq war will be over soon yeah it will be an unqualified success and we're gonna win a second indie band this is our this is our new song there will never be a territorially based islamic jihadist organization that emerged from the chaos created by the iraq war where we smoke fags and star new single
1395.86 1403.04 SPEAKER_02  anders brevik did nothing wrong two three four yeah yeah but again this is from before he would

1803.04 1821.04 SPEAKER_01  i did actually learn that i shouldn't have eaten some of the things they hadn't been wiped down um no i went there there was a that's a different story there was a like little kiosk of uh bread rolls with a man with an ak-47 guarding them and i was like we're in a
1821.04 1826.32 SPEAKER_03  different zone now yeah no one's this fucking bakery has been burned before it was just like
1826.32 1831.66 SPEAKER_04  if jean beljean comes here i'm fucking killing him yeah it was it was it's like going to a greg's in
1831.66 1837.18 SPEAKER_01  wigan yeah yeah some gregs do have bouncers now the late night ones well i always remember
1837.18 1864.60 SPEAKER_04  that's a terrifying genre of bouncers well we talked last time you were on we talked about the turkish restaurant with the bouncers yes i still haven't been um but my girlfriend and i walked they were like not in those shoes sunshine you know can't get in i'm trying to like right it like find someone cool who regularly goes to the turkish restaurant and try and say i'm with him no you have to look really gay yeah what what donor options are there tonight show him your lack of
1864.60 1871.78 SPEAKER_03  paws well you're in no so you gotta name all of the salad bits otherwise they won't let you in
1871.78 1877.88 SPEAKER_04  adana kebab but there are mcdonald's is with bouncers as well quite a few of them and they're
1877.88 1907.18 SPEAKER_03  the most terrifying the one in cambridge has bouncers cambridge well no you know what's weird about cambridge though is that not due to any of the people that live there right but on a friday and saturday night it's rough because everyone from shit towns in the midlands goes to cambridge for a night out because it's less grim yeah so it's like it's people from corby it's people from kettering we're ruining it it's it's bricklayers who will knock you out um and as a result the saturday night mcdonald's bouncer he was he looked like a viking he was the biggest man i've ever seen
1907.18 1915.28 SPEAKER_01  he had a mohawk um i think you need that mcdonald's can be a very feral place post 1am i think yeah it's
1915.28 1924.56 SPEAKER_04  actually worse than the club i think yeah oh 100 well the club people are on good behavior but mcdonald's it's like all of the all of the beefs that we've been building up overnight there's a lot of beef
1924.56 1957.34 SPEAKER_01  than mcdonald's yeah well not always my after my mates hendu this year me and my pal went to mcdonald's like in central about 3am and this guy tried to chat us up through the glass like we were eating our burger pissed as fuck like sat in the window and this guy just came up to the window and was like pointed at both of us and was like come home with us like he's on a prison phone genuinely like that we were like he put his hand up against the glass like this he would put his face up against the glass that's the come on love yeah go on you slake what a great what a great thing to
1957.34 1967.36 SPEAKER_04  do just to be like all right here's how i'm gonna get these these ladies to abandon their drunk food and come home with me yeah is by like blowing my cheeks out against the glass literally that
1967.36 1970.18 SPEAKER_02  we're mcdonald's window and this is late night chirps in
1970.18 1973.40 SPEAKER_01  god i should call him
1973.40 1980.34 SPEAKER_03  this is like a missed connection show like you just describe him yeah and then we presume he
1980.34 2029.36 SPEAKER_01  listens to balsas if you sing it they will come what was what was the hendu like the hendu was great and i'll tell you for why please i think it's the resurgence you went notably more northern on that like one sentence yeah and i'll tell you what i'd say i'll tell you why and i'll tell you for i'll tell you fucking why right because um it was a one night london piss up ah the good old days minimal admin everybody like just having a great time nobody's worried about spending 800 pounds yeah just you're just doing it yeah and a great reminder of why nobody goes out in central london after the pub stage of the night because we went to this club and it was in a fun way that it was i mean it may as well have been a tiger tiger it was a completely different window into like you're out
2029.36 2034.60 SPEAKER_03  with the people from kent now yeah yeah was it zebrano it was it was very similar you know there's
2034.60 2077.66 SPEAKER_01  a gig that runs very similar to zebrano i'm actually barred from zebrano um because i used to work above it years ago and so there was a door from our office into the back of zebranos so you could get in without going out the building and back into the on the you had private zebrano private zebrano access usually reserved for only men paying for women i imagine does david lewis still run that gig there he does yeah yeah i've done that as well but years ago i it's the same owner i think as well and i was like i hope he doesn't remind me i remember me because i snuck in and went behind the bar at the top that wasn't being in use and uh nicked a bottle of amaretto and then he saw me doing it on the cameras and came up and said don't bother coming back down you're banned from
2077.66 2083.48 SPEAKER_04  you're banned from conveniently entering your office yeah essentially that's what happened yeah so that's
2083.48 2099.70 SPEAKER_03  it that was a low moment well the trick with the office is go in at 8 30 a.m get a stamp then go home have a bit more of a sleep come back at 11 a.m you don't have to queue yeah in a different top yeah yeah and they think you've been in since 8 30 clever yeah it's perfect stuff it works very well yeah
2099.70 2148.78 SPEAKER_01  it was actually loop bar that we went to have you been there loop bar it was it was a it was a proper meat market like we were clearly on a hen do just all having a nice laugh like a massive piss up and then these guys just sort of surrounded us um okay yeah and were sort of like quite insistent on you know dancing with us even though we were like very nicely like oh no you know we're just kind of sort of having a night out with our mate tonight like that's not really that kind of vibe and they would not let it go it was like a meat market in there what was do you recall any of their sort of approaches any of the lines the approaches gen genuinely were like just wedging themselves in between me and like somebody i like one of my pals so what like a flanking maneuver genuine like like killer whales with the uh with the seal it was like that it's it's terrible what they do to
2148.78 2156.86 SPEAKER_03  to sharking men these days you know you can if you go to sea world you can actually hear them crying you know they make them wear socks it's not fair
2156.86 2162.90 SPEAKER_01  nobody was wearing any socks in this club it was you're just stroking the glass at sea world
2162.90 2178.22 SPEAKER_03  you belong in an all bar one free you should be drinking a peroni somewhere talking to a guy called smithy yes exactly that you should be wearing really tight jeans and a tight t-shirt was it tight

2205.02 2225.88 SPEAKER_04  that is your favorite fact because it's so funny it's it's that and joseph fritzel that you can be if i hang on i need to know these two facts well joseph fritzel was covering those table legs there was only room for a certain amount of horniness in that way not stop talking about joseph fritzel the austrian guy who had a basement family yeah yeah just generally because yeah just can't stop
2225.88 2238.72 SPEAKER_03  talking what an insane the craziest thing about fritzel right yeah uh is that subsequently another guy did exactly the same thing in the netherlands and he was austrian as well yes he was exporting it

2370.88 2458.50 SPEAKER_03  in her bedroom but her rent was so cheap that she was like i can't complain because then he might figure out how cheap the rent is she's like this is kind of the tax and then while i was there the catalytic converter got nicked off my car outside i'm like they hate air quality around here they really do they loathe it well if you're breathing in that area it's gonna be bad um yeah so yeah i'm there with this girl all these friends come back and they've brought this couple who they're friends with back from the pub as well and they're all like hammered right and the of the couple the girl i think was was british or maybe some other nationality but the guy was definitely dutch and she wasn't dutch that that's the only important element they've gone into the kitchen uh most of the friends along with this girl that i was sleeping with and um i'm chatting to the dutch guy and somehow i think it was maybe not long after the like the dutch guy who did fritzel thing and come out and then so we were i made some joke about it and we were talking about that then his girlfriend comes back in and then we're both having to explain who joseph fritzel is to his girlfriend who somehow had never heard of joseph fritzel she should go to your show well exactly right um watch my new youtube special um and literally and um then uh uh the girl i was sleeping with comes back in and um and she just walks into the room walks into this conversation and just without missing a beat just goes milo are you talking about joseph fritzel again and it was genuinely one of the funniest things anyone has ever said i'm like wow what a perfect like sitcom line read and also

2470.42 2475.94 SPEAKER_01  understood i heard something about him potentially getting out but that can't be true i think he is i think
2475.94 2481.12 SPEAKER_03  he's he's got like really bad dementia and it's like compassionate i think he's no longer a threat
2481.12 2486.20 SPEAKER_04  the court has ordered him to only live on the third floor i was gonna say yeah yeah yeah that's
2486.20 2490.94 SPEAKER_01  right he's not allowed to base i just love the idea that for years his wife was just sat there and it

2568.48 2629.90 SPEAKER_04  browse around sort of some auction houses i know there's some like in south end and variously around the country just looking basically for people who've like for house clearances where there might be like good paintings sure basically oh okay yeah right so like you can you can i found like some you know quote-unquote name brand art with this it's like a hundred pounds it's like this should not be a hundred pounds okay basically yeah this is an original keep calm carry on this is an original dean coon yeah that's right live laugh quickly undust the last one my god i have to i have to stay calm while i off while i lowball the water indiana jones and the semi-detached in basilton um so fiat 500 rolling down the stairs behind him um i found something in my browsings that i didn't want to bid on right but i want to show to you is it a joseph fritzel keepsake oh oh wow oh wow i don't know what's
2629.90 2640.44 SPEAKER_03  better the title or the picture but i think yeah well that alex designed good lord so erotic walking
2640.44 2652.60 SPEAKER_01  stick is something i never thought i would isn't any walking stick erotic if you're a pickup artist if you try hard enough it can be yeah that's right so this is essentially a dildo walking
2652.60 2661.44 SPEAKER_04  stick hybrid yeah that's from the victoria the handle is a penis it's it the handle is a penis it's carved from elephant ivory it's made from a hippo tuss it's made from a hippo tuss do you know
2661.44 2684.58 SPEAKER_01  what cracks me up is that victorian age is that is supposedly the age where you know everything was kind of prudified that's not really a word but like you know before that we were seemingly a lot more sexually liberal as a society and then the victorians you know took away everybody's fun and yet the doctors were wanking women off just because they had an emotion like you know hysteria all that sort of stuff what a time say i mean you can't even get an appointment now
2684.58 2688.92 SPEAKER_04  you have to call 111 and they just talk dirty to you
2688.92 2695.84 SPEAKER_03  that that was very good that was you know yeah you could get on mock the week with people like that
2695.84 2711.64 SPEAKER_01  yeah but they just like they you know they were so prudish in all these ways and yet all this stuff was going on they've got dildos on walking sticks out in the open like if we'd have just let them live they wouldn't have like suppressed everything until we had these like gargoyle sex toys that were
2711.64 2722.40 SPEAKER_03  everywhere and these kind of i was edging for nine hours in a and e waiting waiting to be finished off well the nurses aren't allowed to do it the doctor had to come through now the consultant's gonna have
2722.40 2727.24 SPEAKER_01  gonna have to crank that hog it is political correctness god mad
2727.24 2764.14 SPEAKER_03  but i also so but i think it's um in a serious response to your question i think the victorian period is a lot like the kind of like the gulf theocracies like where it's like it's actually very horny but it's all under the surface yeah which kind of makes it horny all those like argent provocateur say they sell all their most like outre shit in like jibai yeah and it's to like women who are like full niqab but it's all like it behind closed doors all the gears going on underneath something about the kind of suit that like the out the outwards repression of things and then like the the freaky shit going on behind it it's like the kind of the the frontier of
2764.14 2769.92 SPEAKER_01  respectability yeah and everyone's horned up to fuck also like the victorians were fucking they
2769.92 2781.56 SPEAKER_04  were weird they were they had like this the books of the dead and they were completely fascinated especially american victorians yes but they were fascinated like there was a huge fascination with
2781.56 2800.96 SPEAKER_01  like the occult and death uh there was loads of there's a thing where they can trace why so many women like saw especially women like saw apparitions there was a massive sort of ghost story poltergeist emergence really and then they traced it's like the gas lamps i think like it was basically they were
2800.96 2817.44 SPEAKER_04  being gas lit they were literally being gas lit people were you know it's you know it's people were doing cocaine masturbating medically they were constantly inhaling gas fumes yeah it's the all of the all of the um sort of like repressive prudishness yeah it's just the bit that survives 100%
2817.44 2830.78 SPEAKER_01  yeah you know but you know i think you should get the dildo walking stick is the is basically the conclusion to that i don't want it don't you you've showed us it it's in your mind i'm looking at so i know
2830.78 2841.98 SPEAKER_03  just give it a death old wife it'll be fine in fairness you don't know where it's been it's a circumcised penis though interestingly well it's exactly it's provenance uh is unclear
2841.98 2854.80 SPEAKER_01  it's provenance you don't have a um i guess if you put a little sheath over it you can uncircumcise it or you can put a little condom on it to promote to promote safe sex it's sensible to
2854.80 2859.96 SPEAKER_03  do that before you so i would imagine ivory is quite porous oh i don't yeah what if it
2859.96 2863.88 SPEAKER_01  cracked inside you or something well you'd be upset about that as a hippo wouldn't you
2863.88 2867.42 SPEAKER_03  that's what you're like this is an insult you're going around with one tusk i don't know if that
2867.42 2876.76 SPEAKER_01  was your dad like oh well my dad lived an honorable life as a hippo and now and now in death he's making
2876.76 2882.86 SPEAKER_04  like you know some some like body baronet have a little chuckle yeah if you're a hippo that's like
2882.86 2886.16 SPEAKER_03  one of the options they give you at the funeral director it's like would you like him made into
2886.16 2896.04 SPEAKER_04  an erotic walking stick okay that's that's the construction i'd like to give in my own death i would like some part of me to be made into an erotic walking stick that's right they've used his
2896.04 2906.58 SPEAKER_01  real penis they've taxidermied it yeah i wonder if you could um because you can get kits where you make a a dildo vibrator out of your own penis i thought you'd be like a taxidermy

2967.16 2981.04 SPEAKER_01  so i've literally got a bit at the moment about how my dad is such a tight-ass scottish bastard that he worries that we're going to spend money on his coffin and he's like put me in a box put me in a cardboard box yeah so that's probably why the cheap one has a scottish flag on it yeah yeah yeah yeah
2981.04 3028.10 SPEAKER_03  um and then uh and then i was like joking about it and then the funeral director was like i'll just let you choose in private and then so when he when he came back i was like i was like pointing at the my sisters were like making suggestions i was like no i think we should have this one and i'm like pointing at the scottish flag and he's like and he's like what and i'm like laughing and he's like oh did your did your mother have some kind of connection to scotland or and then i'm like oh no she just hated the scotch i just thought it'd be ironic and then he like looked visibly shocked and i'm like no i didn't no that's not no i'm grieving all right but then at the back it's like would you like i made into a paperweight and i'm like a bit fucking hefty paperweight it's just like mad stuff like they'll like take their fingerprints and make it into a necklace like i'm just like this is this is getting to the point of like i'll put her teeth on a chain why not
3028.10 3038.54 SPEAKER_04  at some point this goes from paying commemoration into trophy yeah i've got like i've got a necklace of

3061.30 3069.50 SPEAKER_01  oh god it's met like it's such a commodification of like oh it's all like four million pounds yeah
3069.50 3084.02 SPEAKER_04  like yeah yeah it's the same thing as like a like a marriage right like it's it's like well i guess i guess i'm well you're you're getting married so you know do you want the do you want the the flowers boo bad flowers or do you want the flowers yeah
3084.02 3095.22 SPEAKER_03  oh and the funeral photographers are a ripoff yeah they're in front of the coffin and they're like right let's do a sad one all right let's do one with just the deceased

3107.48 3112.76 SPEAKER_01  paddington bear on the top of the cake why is paddington now the symbol of royal death what has
3112.76 3127.98 SPEAKER_03  happened there i don't know but i love it i know i'm obsessed with this he's an immigrant they would not have liked him um yeah and uh my my girlfriend works for studio canal and apparently they're not keen on this unauthorized use of paddington but there's nothing they can do about it
3127.98 3143.16 SPEAKER_04  what's it to serve an injunction to like it yeah to like twitter users yeah they serve an injunction to like you know linda 184617 like hey please you must stop associating you must stop paddington mustn't be a psychopath so weird
3143.16 3167.90 SPEAKER_03  well so i was actually talking about this with alice yesterday on twitter because she was talking about how is it that the soviets spent years trying to come up with secular death rituals and somehow paddington has by accident become the first secular psychopomp and i was like well canonically the first secular psychopomp is actually a psychopomp psychopomp is um uh dci gene hunt and i think a meme where it's like come on charlie fire up the quattro would be a lot better like this is also passing you by
3167.90 3169.20 SPEAKER_04  hi i have a question
3169.20 3240.50 SPEAKER_03  yeah what okay so there were there were um two tv series like a like a main show and then a spin-off that ran in like the mid to late 2000s called life on mars and ashes to ashes where they were both about policemen who were in a coma very and they woke and they were like in the coma they were dreaming that they were in the police but in manchester in the 70s and their boss is this guy dci gene hunt so wait wait wait what the spin-off so it's a show about sorry the first series is a guy a guy gets he has an accident as a police and he gets like hit on the head or something and he goes into a coma and he's like having this like vivid coma dream that he is like in the police in manchester in the 70s but it's like you know it's set in the modern day sure but in the coma it's the 70s yeah and the the lead detective is this guy called dci gene hunt and he's like parody british like plain clothes detective in the 70s like you're fucking nicked sunshine like you know they've all got like little revolvers and like you know it's that and like uh anyway and then they did a second series of it where it was like a woman a woman police officer who gets hit on the head and she has a coma dream where it's the 80s but it's still dci gene hunt but he's just older so he's got an audi quattro
3240.50 3271.12 SPEAKER_04  is is is the is the sort of premise that they're like a fish out of water like a king connecticut yankee and kid arthur's king arthur kid arthur kid arthur yo kid arthur round tables 12 nights yo sipping from my king cup kid arthur and these are the round tables uh so king kennedy yankee and king arthur's court basically yeah but instead it's like someone from now going to a little bit ago yeah and it's doing all of that kind of like what the police used to be like
3271.12 3275.72 SPEAKER_02  when they were real fucking blocks and they didn't have hr you know i could do the paperwork where they
3275.72 3281.50 SPEAKER_00  just arrested with people who were sort of quite grievously racist yeah exactly but anyway the the
3281.50 3299.68 SPEAKER_03  basically the twist at the end so sorry spoilers for a tv show from 15 years ago is that like it's like a kind of purgatory for policemen and gene hunt is like a sort of like ferryman figure and his job is to like usher them to the to the other side so like your your gruff cop boss do you know i didn't know
3299.68 3304.88 SPEAKER_01  that i've watched like a few of them do you know what i mean yeah like i was never i think you only find
3304.88 3330.90 SPEAKER_03  out at the end of the second series which i didn't watch that's amazing i didn't know that um credit to my girlfriend for informing me yeah that's a great show she's a big fan of ashes to ashes which i didn't watch um but yeah so the other the other cops are all also like kind of like soul stranded between this world and the next but dci gene hunt is like a kind of like angelic figure apparently but also who's a racist police man that would be funny if all the angels were racist
3330.90 3341.46 SPEAKER_01  you know yeah yeah i have to i have to go in a sec i think that's probably actually all we have time gene hunt is ushering you to the other side of the podcast gene hunt is calling me from a white light
3341.46 3359.30 SPEAKER_03  at the end of a tunnel he's fired up whatever he would drive now um oh what would he drive now what is the equivalent i mean literally the equivalent of the audi quattro is probably like the audi s3 yeah i was gonna say it's not a million miles away no close enough uh have you got
