0.00 33.44 SPEAKER_05  making the Gary Neville noise there oh yeah um hello and welcome to Britainology the podcast about Britain and why it's like that I am Milo Edwards someone who's lived in Britain his entire
33.44 106.70 SPEAKER_04  life and I'm joined as ever by my co-host neighbor Thay hi it's me I'm back uh it's finally happened I finally had to move out of my house because they're ripping out the floor so Temples Water can fix the collapse sewer because everything in this country is just fucking ridiculous and obviously we were going to do Britainology no matter what but you you you mentioned this topic today and I was excited because uh while I haven't been following all of the furore on social media I live in South London land of proud XL bully owners and a recent phenomenon that I would describe as a dog shit protest like dog shit civil disobedience in which uh more so than normal the XL bully owners are out with their XL bullies and having them shit just leaving it so South London is now a bit more of a minefield uh and in one case I was uh I was grabbing my bike out of a bike locker watching people have a a loud extremely fuck off you twat kind of argument in extremely South London accent uh and had to very gingerly navigate my bike wheel around the minefield of XL bully shit right in front of the bike locker and I was just like god's own country
106.70 123.68 SPEAKER_05  yeah I had a kingdom there are two dangers that you have to avoid in South London one is the XL bully and two is the late middle-aged West African man driving a 2002 Range Rover that has not been serviced in the last 15 years do the brakes work let's find out there's also the
123.68 154.64 SPEAKER_04  phenomenon of two-way street that has become a narrow one-way street because of everyone parking wherever the fuck they want but there's a guy with like a like equilibrium gun caught a sense of the fucking left and right limits of his ice white Range Rover who can just has total confidence whipping that thing down the nearest road on earth and it's it's it's terrifying to behold but if you're riding your bike or walking or whatever it's even worse so yeah you're not allowed to have emotions in South London everyone's on the pill that is that is that's North London let's be real that's
154.64 160.36 SPEAKER_03  yeah I've never I've never South London is the more passionate of the two yeah absolutely yeah I would
160.36 165.40 SPEAKER_05  probably agree with that the the um the Range Rover Cata is like a fun thought experiment
165.40 173.10 SPEAKER_04  yeah Range Rover Cata is just basically yeah driving driving around where I live juggling all
173.10 177.52 SPEAKER_05  of your Starbucks keep cups without taking your eyes off of the road I would I mean I would disagree
177.52 308.84 SPEAKER_03  about as a cata because like the cata sort of implies that like there's an art to it but you sort of know instinctively and the thing about new Range Rovers and like the new kids like they all have senses so I actually would argue that part of the arrogance that comes with it is this sense of false security that the Range Rover gives a driver which it advertises like you know it does sort of say that oh you know we're actually a really safe car we've got all these things that will keep you inside your like military tank uh safe um but they also gives because like I had an interaction with uh with one uh the other day albeit in my new headquarters in uh in in northwest London um where I had to go so to go to our sort of like local dump we have to go for a country road um and that country road obviously like narrows and so you know you know that like someone's got to stop uh and uh every time I see a Range Rover or like a 4x4 in front of me um I just absolutely know that not only are they not going to stop even though it'd be far easier for them to do that than it would be for me but they'll actually like increase the speed of which they're driving down this road and that doesn't make any sense as to why other than this sense of just like they have this big car and a sense of false security and so I think that's much more of like it could be like a London thing it could be a British thing I don't think that's necessarily like a South London thing but however the reason why I brought this up was because I do have the South London story of the Range Rover which was when I was back in uh back in Southeast London uh uh you know about the real neck of the woods my favorite thing to see was um because you know both of you have been to my old house before so you'll know that all the weird stuff that happens there my one of my favorite things were Range Rovers drivers who were trying to like oh so we lived in a place where like there were lots of travelers like a traveler there was a quite an abundant traveler community so you would see like horses like sort of going up and down the streets like all the time um and the Range Rover is trying to um overtake the horses but not quite being able to do it and then that leading to altercations where the Range Rover driver comes out and like tries to like scare the traveler uh by sort of threatening to fight and then the traveler being like okay go come come fight me come fight me like you know and then
308.84 312.90 SPEAKER_05  I was gonna say of all of the groups in the UK that I would threaten to fist fight I think the
312.90 350.58 SPEAKER_03  travelers would be pretty low down the list it was yeah it was like one of the funniest things that I saw from my because I could see it all from my window and it was like one of like this driver like comes out of his car like you know this sort of like ethics bars guy who like you know thinks that he's really hard and like probably does kind of because of again because of what the Range Rover um feeds into you uh and like feeds into your sort of sense of ego only to then be humbled by like a shirtless man uh in the British winter in the British winter like who has probably like gone into like actual like you know bare knuckle fights just regularly throughout his life if not
350.58 359.92 SPEAKER_04  yeah if you took every every affray charge he'd gotten in his life it'd be like the domes day book I mean it's just fully like it's a whole documented history the domes day book the book that tells
359.92 370.58 SPEAKER_05  you where you can get the best head in Norman England am I saying it wrong the first blow job was given out in the village of Royden in 1064
370.58 374.78 SPEAKER_04  well I mean am I am I saying it wrong or is that what is because I mean it's spelled like that but
374.78 383.36 SPEAKER_03  it's pronounced the doomsday book is it no I've I've heard I've heard it I've heard it pronounced for domes day I've heard it pronounced the other way it is it's written the domes day so it is
383.36 397.18 SPEAKER_05  sometimes people do sometimes mistakenly say like that but yes the domes day book is just a very funny riff I'm not even ripping on you for saying it like that it's just it's a very funny idea William the Conqueror arrived and he was like we need to know where the best sloppy top is in this
397.18 427.02 SPEAKER_04  god forsaken nation yeah look I mean you know y'all yeah I thought I had gotten out of the wilderness you don't fuck me up with place names as much anymore like I I know that it's pronounced Darby I know that it's reading and not reading all that shit that's that's that's baby shit but I just didn't reading is the one thing they do not do I I didn't know that it was the doomsday book so you know what fine however we're not we're not even here to talk about about ice white range rovers although they are a critical element of understanding this country because the only thing I wanted to add
427.02 456.14 SPEAKER_03  to that and very quickly was more just like um in up in north london like up in like other parts of the uk and up in north london like you sort of tolerate yeah you tolerate the range rover driver but in south london they've developed the ways and this is where the xl bully comes in I feel like they've developed like the way in which like that the only way that you can fight this new class of people um and that might be through like bare knuckle boxing but it might also be um deliberately breeding a very particular kind of dog and the only type of dog who would probably
456.14 469.62 SPEAKER_05  be able to tear apart a range rover that's right I'm breeding a dog the size of a range rover and we're getting into a kind of clifford the xl bully situation so so my uh my experience my my sort of
469.62 618.66 SPEAKER_04  uh apotheosis of ice white range rover experience was I was going for a run in burgess park and saw someone driving a range rover with like a full-size union jack strapped to the back of it except it was the thin blue line blackout union jack and I was just like I feel as though this person has something they want to say and my my apotheosis of xl bully experience so far has been before I even knew it was a thing cynthia and I before our daughter was born were trying to visit a bunch of like make it a thing once a week to like go out to some of the parks that are perhaps further out from where we live to get a chance to see like all these different spots around south london and one day we went to crystal palace park which is big and nice but strange because it has the big athletic training facility and all the old like football facility stuff and then the the sort of foundations of this you know world wonder of engineering that they let burn down and now it doesn't exist anymore the crystal palace how does a building made of glass burn down question one but I mean how only in britain how does a country where it's fucking raining all the time be like oh sorry the train can't run today there's wet leaves on the tracks you tell me but all I'm saying is walking around crystal palace park in some areas in the built-up parts looks like just disco elysium in real life and nothing was more of a bizarre disco elysium experience than happening upon an xl bully owners meetup where there was easily 40 to 50 guys all guys couple of women with huge fucking dogs on gigantic chains all just kind of hanging out and drinking tins in like and you'd think that would be imposing but because the proportions of all the things of crystal palace park are meant for like you know huge football crowds that don't come there anymore because I don't believe that the that facility there at the park is is the current one or if it is then it wasn't in use that day and so instead it was just like I'm in the the the endless barren concrete kneel you know like brutalist plains and here's just 50 guys with gigantic dogs just kind of hanging out just doing their thing and I realized like ah this is this is a cultural phenomenon that I just simply don't know about um but then the government decided they were going to ban xl bullies and uh as such everyone got mad yeah we've got it we've got to talk about the xl bullies yeah I've so I don't know
618.66 660.60 SPEAKER_03  whether we're going to come to this at some point we'll have time to come to this but like they got mad but I think one of the interesting things is also the way in which like the politics of dog owners kind of changed as a result of that um only because like it wasn't this thing so I think I've always had this sort of understanding that Britain is like a dog country in the sense that like you know there are actual in the Australian sense well there are actual stories so like a story that I've told on my I don't know a couple maybe a couple of times um but I've said I've said I've talked about it a few times online is that like a friend of mine who I grew up with um he when he went to uni uh his parents like made uh turned his room into the dog's room
660.60 667.70 SPEAKER_05  and so when he came back what is more British than hating your children and also giving their
667.70 707.96 SPEAKER_03  room to a dog when he when he came back he was like well could I like go sleep back in my room because like obviously you don't live at university the whole time like you come back and they were like well no it's the dog's room so he was like okay so where am I supposed to sleep he's like well there's an airbed like you can sleep in the airbed downstairs and so he's like really upset because he's like well no it's my fucking room like why can't I stay here over Christmas break like this doesn't make any sense in his bed and it was like yeah but you can't this if they actually said they said you can't disturb the dog while sleeping um and so I always like understood it in that way whereas I was like okay like this is a country that just prefers dogs to human beings and I still think that's like broadly true but one of the interesting things that I found well we all remember
707.96 717.50 SPEAKER_05  fucking uh pen pen farthington or whatever the fuck his name was who like was rescuing all the dogs from afghanistan the only afghanistan refugees that the british people were happy to let in
717.50 762.32 SPEAKER_03  one of the interesting things about this and like whenever you look at like excel bully content and I was like you know you've been looking for it like while doing this episode I was looking for some in the run-up to doing this but just on your own time and in my own time as well um shaking my head to show that I disagree with it but um what uh what I found was that there was a lot of like beef between dog owners um and so there were like some dog owners that were just like oh you know the excel bully owners they're sort of like making it difficult for everyone else they're gonna like muzzle all our dogs soon what's gonna happen to like my fucking like poodle sausage or whatever um and like there were others who basically I think I was very surprised about like the lack of sympathy among like the broader dog community not to be confused with the dogging community who have their own
762.32 766.70 SPEAKER_05  issues with dogs previously of saying kazani appearances on this podcast that's right I am
766.70 803.64 SPEAKER_03  like the dog expert despite the fact that I I neither dog or dog um uh but you're dogged by the accusation that is correct but yeah like you know so like the beef between owners and like that's really exposed a type of politics of like pet ownership and dogging but I didn't quite know was there and I think that's sort of been really fascinating about this as a sort of like subject into looking into the British psyche like this isn't a country where it's just like universally they love all dogs it's like actually no like they prefer certain dogs over others and uh you know there are like classist elements to it as well I'm sure we'll get into it but yeah that's kind of what I was
803.64 889.84 SPEAKER_04  thinking all I can say Hussein is that I thought you would find this very funny as a complete aside if my buddy Saf sent me this it was a one-star review on Amazon uh sales site for a children's book called Ramadan uh and the person says I don't recommend this book there are some Islamic concerns in this book like women showing women leading salah dog in the house under the table when having sahur few characters in the book eating with left hand this book is published by mainstream traditional company Simon & Schuster not sure if this is done by the author with lack of knowledge and I thought to myself I'm like what could be more offensive than dog in-house and I realized I was like Britain as you said is it just a dog is a dogging country and a dog country and people Americans are also this way where I think we I don't I don't think other European countries are as much of like dog sleeps in bed and I kiss it on the lips every day uh as Britain Americans at least white Americans are very much like this and so there's a strange kind of rhyming here if you will because some of the stuff we've talked about on this show is so unbelievably foreign to me that even if like god forbid I could never leave Britain ever again I'd never get used to it but people being I don't know if this is the right word and I sound like like like tiktok psychologist here but like kind of over familiar with their dogs you know what I mean like and and and and as generally assuming that everyone wants to kiss their dog on the mouth as much as they do like that's very much an American thing too well I actually pulled up
889.84 900.78 SPEAKER_05  the stats on this according to a survey conducted by bizarrely Myra showers they found that 1.6 million Brits admit to kissing their dog on the mouth I have I have another story about this a second-hand
900.78 957.58 SPEAKER_03  story from a buddy of mine who like um he so I uh I went I uh went with him to uni and uh there was this girl in uh that uh we also went to you like it was in the same kind of halls as us and he had this huge crush on her um and she was very attractive and like you know just sort of very conventionally out of this league but uh he tried for a very long time and in the middle of our second year she finally agreed to sort of like hang out with him during the easter holidays and they lived like fairly close by so um he went to her house to like go pick her up and she had that kind of relationship with a dog and he I remember him telling me that like so she like basically had like a full-on like tongue kiss with her dog um that he saw and then so the whole time that they're there this is a fucking curb he hasn't he's trying to figure out like well he wants to like make a move he wants to kiss her but he's just like that girl fucking like mouth kissed her dog and so it was this thing about like no this
957.58 968.12 SPEAKER_05  is a Jerry plot line in Seinfeld 100 it would be like an absolute dime piece of a woman but she kisses the dog on the mouth and Jerry has to break up with her this is basically it uh yeah and so like the
968.12 1002.36 SPEAKER_03  whole time he's like it was the worst day of my life because like she looked really hot and I really wanted to like just kiss her and like I've been thinking about it for a year and a half but all I could think of was that she fully mouth kissed her dog and hasn't wiped her mouth since that point um and then I think at the end of the day I had to go straight to eating the ass at the end of the day uh in his version she like tried to kind of lean in to kiss him but what ended up happening was that he like was so did not want to kiss her lips so he so she ended up giving him like
1002.36 1017.52 SPEAKER_05  a weird like peck on his cheek situation um and I know this is this is so a Seinfeld plot line like I cannot this is like b for b this is exactly like a like an elite tier Seinfeld plot like dodging the
1017.52 1084.42 SPEAKER_04  kiss and then her being like what the fuck look man some folks just like to kiss their dogs on the mouth and it's weird oh I I just I've never really weird uh my parents off and on sometimes had dogs sometimes didn't have dogs but when we lived in Indiana they got a rescue standard poodle that was like had been abandoned and they and she was a great dog except she likes to eat shit and then throw it up inside the house and sometimes I'd come home from school and I'd be the first person home and I would have to clean up the dogs they had apparently she'd been rescued by like people whose first name was spain first not first name first first language is spanish and they had named her felice and felice the lucky dog yeah she I would be like ah felice has eaten shit and thrown it up in the house and I have to clean it up and stop her from eating the poop vomit and so knowing that that's just how dogs are there's like that's like a common enough thing there's like how to you know dog obedience training stop your dog from eating shit I just simply wouldn't kiss the dog on the mouth it's just no that's like all they do all day is lick their balls in their asshole like it's just and apparently eat shit and everything everything other gross thing they can find
1084.42 1100.36 SPEAKER_05  yeah wouldn't do it my girlfriend had a dog for a while and it used to have to wear a nappy when it was on its period and then sometimes she would like like the washing machine would be like full of the dog nappies and I'd just be like I'm not I don't I hope we're not putting any other laundry in with
1100.36 1107.56 SPEAKER_04  those I'm sorry but I just I just wouldn't yeah it's like look and dog people just think it's fine
1107.56 1112.56 SPEAKER_05  like that it's a certain type of person it's just like oh yeah the fucking the dog period
1112.56 1145.76 SPEAKER_04  yeah oh yeah your dog I didn't you know I haven't gotten my dog neutered so he just humps your leg and blew a huge fucking wad all over you that's normally no cute dog no having a dog come on you is not cute I'm sorry like and those little bastards are fucking like they're like like one minute champions I swear like if you don't stop them from humping something they will jizz on it fast like yeah they have that opportunistic buster they have no concept of like holding out for the long game okay like it's it's a bad idea yeah so we should we should talk
1145.76 1199.82 SPEAKER_05  about XL Bullies I pulled up some just some other primer facts on the Brits and dogs uh 31 percent of UK households own at least one dog a total of 12 million dogs the most popular breeds being Labradors and French Bulldogs which is really a land of contrasts um yeah uh dog acts have won Britain's got talent a show which has been on the air since 2007 like one season per year uh a total of two times and have reached the final four times you can imagine what a dog talent show act is like and the British people have decided that was the most talented person in Britain twice um so yeah I wanted to start with a little bit of history on the XL Bully so I I the first thing I've included in the notes is this image which I feel is the first thing that we all heard of the concept of an XL Bully yes that's true yeah the the two times pimpy three times bape um creating the world's widest dog
1199.82 1206.92 SPEAKER_04  Doughboy yeah my mindset exotics with a z yes I did yeah I did see this image yeah yeah you've got to
1206.92 1236.50 SPEAKER_05  have the the mindset the exotic mindset um I I think this dog isn't technically an XL Bully it's like another very closely related dog called like it's it's called something really stupid I can't remember the name but it's like the uh like a like a traditional XL Bully is like a taller and there's like another term for these like very short and wide ones I think they still count as an XL Bully in terms of the government uh well because that's what I will determine that the it's such a vague
1236.50 1250.32 SPEAKER_04  definition in terms of like breed and that like it could get lumped into the legal guidelines even if it's not I think even if like deliberately if the real heads out there know it's not an XL Bully
1250.32 1365.24 SPEAKER_05  the government doesn't yeah yeah so basically I've um uh I've included some stuff about the law itself but the the the TLDR about that is that it seems as though it's it's sort of deliberately based on the characteristics of the dog rather than the genetics of a dog to kind of like basically pin down what makes the dog dangerous in terms of its like size and muscle mass and stuff um so it could apply to things that aren't technically an XL Bully but are in that kind of like Pitbull attack dog neck of the woods um so uh I took this from the Guardian this is like just a little bit of history about the XL Bully the American XL Bully is a modern breed of dog developed in the 1990s the largest variation of the American Bully breed that also includes the Pocket Bully and the Standard Bully it's thought to have been bred from a number of breeds including the American Pitbull Terrier which was banned in the UK in 1991 it has a heavy bone structure and stocky muscular body fully grown adult males can weigh more than 57 kilos and grow to 53 centimeters in height first introduced to the UK in about 2014 the dog has soared in popularity in recent years with puppies selling thousands of pounds however as it is not officially recognized as a breed by the Royal Kennel Club there's little data on how many there are numbers are believed to be in the thousands according to Bully Watch a group that has campaigned for the breed to be banned they account for less than one percent of all owned dogs across the country um I've also included this uh like it's like a genealogy chart from the uh from the telegraph uh where it talks about the how they're all descended from this dog called um UKC's most wanted Kimbo also known as killer Kimbo who in turn was was sired by a couple called Castro's Bull and Castro's Diva the the names that XL bullies have is like a great no it's it's it's tremendous yeah unstoppable juggernaut is another famous XL bully uh and of course Frank Sinatra cookie dough EKG Scarface and
1365.24 1420.16 SPEAKER_04  the Joker I mean I I wouldn't I if I had to put up with a huge dog I suppose it should be named the Joker I mean I dealt with big I mean my parents they were working dogs that my parents had two um what do they call great Pyrenees now they they lived in a dog hutch outside they were meant for herding sheep they kind of look like big furry golden retrievers don't they yeah I mean they're if you haven't seen them before they're big they have a sort of like when you actually do you encounter them in person they have a sort of like bear-like aspect to them but they were they were perfectly friendly they just were like 140 pounds so they were gigantic dogs um but I wouldn't want to they were they weighed the same as like a Brooklyn barista yeah I wouldn't want a dog that big in my house and I think the thing with the uh with the XL bullies that I've seen is often they're like very very muscular so like they're like compact but heavy as hell I don't
1420.16 1424.40 SPEAKER_05  know I I would be a little bit worried about the um yeah they're built like the guys at the at the
1424.40 1540.70 SPEAKER_03  gym at Bethnal Green you know like like short but wide so my former neighbor um who was very nice guy and uh absolutely did deal drugs but it was very nice guy uh he had an XL bully um he dealt very good drugs uh I don't know whether they were the community I don't know whether they were very good but um you know he was he was he was he was a nice guy and it was very clear why he had the bully in the sense that like obviously he had shit and like in his house or like just somewhere ever and he needed and he saw that as like a protection dog um and I could see like the garden of his house from like my little balcony and so I would see this XL bully like quite a lot and like my god I feel like at one point I did see the XL bully doing press-ups like I you know just like the way that it was like sort of getting up and getting down and because you could see the muscles I was like holy shit he it's doing it's doing press-ups but the reason why um my main memory of the XL bully is uh the time when the but when uh he took he took that dog outside um and uh he didn't realize that there were other people like you know coming out as well and so this dog like hears me coming and you know immediately runs and I know like oh fuck this dog's coming so I'd like go back into the house close the gate and that dog like um before he gets stopped by his owner um like puts his paws onto the door and uh when I come out and after the but after the dog is gone like like the bottom parts of my my old like garden door like are just completely chipped off so like and this is like the bully isn't sort of like it's this it wasn't like it attacking in any way it was just like putting its paws up like you know because it wanted someone's attention right this was like the bully sort of being friendly and it and like it took out like a chunk of my door ah it was it was it was normal stuff yeah I think like you don't you can see the pictures of it and it's obviously like oh this is brutal but I think like when you actually see it and when you sort of like see its effects it really does yeah well that's that's like that's really something else
1540.70 1583.24 SPEAKER_05  it really reminds me of um like uh insane gun guys in the states where it's like you all bought the most dangerous gun you could find because you thought it was cool and sick nasty and now you're having to pretend that there's some reason you bought that gun that wasn't that like you know ah there's like a million coyotes that live in my basement or whatever well it's the same with the XL bullies it's like the only reason you buy that particular dog rather than any of the other millions of different types of dog you could get is because it's like a hard dog is because it looks dangerous it is dangerous like aesthetically that's what you want and or you own a junkyard in the 1950s I would I would say like you can't take my XL bully I need it to keep their waves and
1583.24 1593.64 SPEAKER_04  straight I was gonna say in a gang of four you know grade school boys are having a sort of illuminating coming of age experience going to see a dead body in the middle of the woods and they get chased by it
1593.64 1598.88 SPEAKER_05  that's just simply your your name is heroin gym you carry a flick knife and you wear like a suit
1598.88 1672.62 SPEAKER_03  I would say like one of the one of the differences in my mind between like the gun owner analogy and the dog one is that like and and Nate like correct me if I'm wrong here um but with the gun guys that I've sort of like had some interactions with whenever I've been in the states uh it is usually been that they'll always sort of say like oh like we have got the guns as a form of defense and their thing is like oh you know the fucking AR-15 or whatever like you know we're still using it for defensive reasons so even though this is a gun that you absolutely don't need to like for the simple purposes of defense they will still kind of claim that like it's made its functionary purpose is to be shot it is to be shot at people but it is to be shot at people for defensive reasons the the difference with the XL bully is that even though it's very clear that the people who buy them or the people who like um get them are doing it for their own kind of logical like logic of defensive reasons and like the videos that you sent me have like different reasonings for that but ultimately even though that exists like the defense of the XL bully has been kind of bizarre because these like a lot of these owners are just denying that these dogs are in any way malicious so like you'll like hear some interviews where they're like oh yeah he's so soft he wouldn't touch a fly but it's like okay but why does why does he have like roaring fucking biceps then like why and then
1672.62 1682.84 SPEAKER_05  quite often the video will like smash cut to it like destroying a football like them throwing a football in the air and the dog biting out of the air and instantly rupturing it into like four
1682.84 1721.82 SPEAKER_03  pieces like yeah yeah it seems like like these owners are just like they're sort of like claiming that their XL bullies are really no different from like the fucking sausage poodles or whatever and that to me is more absurd because it would make i would i would have a lot more respect for them if they were like yeah we got these dogs because they're fucking massive they can tear people apart and that makes me feel safe right we can sort of like debate whether that you know we can sort of like you know think about stupid logic or it's unnecessary like but but you can have a conversation from that point but i feel like a non-starter the dog is also called like hitler's revenge for some reason it's like it's a non-starter to just be like oh yeah this dog actually is just a fucking poodle it's like come on man be like be please please just be serious
1721.82 1732.28 SPEAKER_04  please just be serious look at it for two seconds what if you gave an XL bully like a Tory dog name though what if the XL bully was Mufti oh there we go yeah you could make it british you know you could
1732.28 1742.90 SPEAKER_05  you have no the dog would have to be called like jessica the mom would the owner would be called Mufti yeah that's right we're gonna get the king's road XL bully yeah exactly yeah walking walking
1742.90 1833.24 SPEAKER_04  down the street and you're in your barber coat with a yeah with a dog named gingerbread that's 19 stowed and rips humans to shreds look man my dog's built like lennox lewis it's gonna fucking tear you apart i i i to answer your question hussein i think that um american dog owners are similar to this like people who own pit bulls and XL bullies as well because i mean that's that's it's an american breed i guess i didn't know that uh but i mean the bulldog is we would just kind of call them bulldogs like some kind of bulldogs or pit bulls like that's uh the the the i it's possible that that turned that the explicit expression XL bully is something that's caught on i don't know because i mean i don't live in america anymore but when i think about that stuff like a lot of it in america is to do like you said with looking hard the notion of defense uh dog fighting stuff like that uh you also had dogs like was like rottweilers and doberman pinchers and stuff like that that were also sort of considered attack dogs um but with guns i think it's it's just it's it that's a specifically weird cultural thing in america um because ultimately like there is an advantage to having a gun that's that powerful and it can hold that many rounds but like at the end of the day my argument has always been and it's just for me for me here like i can't like speak for anything is it like like yeah it's better to have it's nice to have that many rounds but if you can't defend your home with like a revolver then you're just you just suck at shooting yeah you know what i mean like it's just one of those things where it's not really the argument doesn't make sense
1833.24 1856.98 SPEAKER_05  well i tell you what you can't defend your home from with a revolver is an XL bully exactly because uh quoting from the telegraph here there was a dog that killed a child in louisiana in 2014 and it took the louisiana state police 12 rounds to bring down well that's because they had to shoot every other dog in the neighborhood that's what i said it's like you know it's bad when the american cops are struggling to kill a dog something they've had a lot of practice yeah because they
1856.98 1958.28 SPEAKER_04  actually fired 350 shots and every one of those bullets killed another dog except for the 12 that killed that one and they weren't actually targeting those other dogs they just they're they also suck at shooting yeah i mean um it's an odd one but i i think that that argument of oh this dog wouldn't hurt a fly and it's like right but a regular dog getting mad or upset or stressed for some reason and freaking out and biting is dangerous it's very dangerous uh because it's a fucking animal it's a it's an animal and they can do they can they can harm yeah i mean i've i got if it's a sausage dog your chances of being seriously injured are quite small my uncle had uh a kind of i cannot remember exactly it wasn't like a weimaraner but it was it was a similar dog and i hadn't seen him in years and i went to visit him at his house in virginia uh and he was like hey what's up and you know gave me a hug when i came in the room and the dog didn't know me and saw me hugging my uncle and thought i was attacking him and jumped up and fucking bit me and it left like cheese bruises and a puncture wound on the side it was like it wasn't like massively bleeding but like it was painful and that was like a not particularly aggressive bite from a dog so i think about that sometimes like you if you've got a little kid and you've got one of these dogs that like if they get pissed off they do this like there is danger there's danger also i think more more likely although these dogs are you know famous for attacking people is more likely they'll kill other dogs yeah yeah because that's a really common thing you know the dogs play and it's like oh we're both descended from wolves it's like yes but one can fit inside a slipper and the other one is basically like you know like like like if you showed this to the average middle-aged peasant they think you summoned a demon like it's you know that like they they they they think that like i don't know that
1958.28 1968.36 SPEAKER_05  the it's been a tough day for that medieval peasant first of all he had to drink a can of dr pepper and shat himself and then he was shown an excel bully yeah exactly himself again yeah and and he was he
1968.36 1979.84 SPEAKER_04  was only able to be uh to be lifted from his malaise by a single cool ranch dorito which unfortunately gave him an aneurysm yeah r.i.p to that guy i think this is also at the hub this is also at the heart of
1979.84 2096.60 SPEAKER_03  like this kind of um uh friction between like dog owners and the sort of like new kind of politics of dog ownership that we've seen like as a result of this um because and again this is all like anecdotal evidence but like i grew up in a place where like you could probably like or like in the area of south london that i spent quite a lot of my childhood in and that i lived in until very recently um this was very much a place where like people cared a lot more about their dogs than like other people in their lives um and you know i like did paper rounds in like estates where there weren't like excel bullies but there were like pit bulls and like i remember i again i think i may have told the story before but i remember when i was doing a paper round uh the first time i got chased out of an estate by a dog was uh because i had gone into like so if you imagine like the estate like where how the estate is laid out um i went to like the left side of it and apparently that was like a territory for like these two dogs that like just roamed around the estates without like being leashed or anything and so as a result they were like oh fuck this guy is like you know why presumably like oh this child is like gonna rob some houses and so they're like running at me and like barking and you know just so you can see like the sharpness of their teeth and stuff and i ended up like just like dropping the papers and running and then what i was told afterwards was like oh you needed to go around the other side so the dog could watch you go around and then it would let you in if you were like on your on like doing good behavior like if you if it sort of didn't see you as a threat um and like so i've grown up in an area where like this stuff is like fairly common and which was why it's really so it was really surprising that like i saw a lot of dog owners like actually complaining about the excel bullies and so much of it came with like oh when i take my dog out to the park and by the way that dog is only is not leashed i'm never gonna leash it it keeps getting like attacked by like these pit bull breeds like the excel bully and stuff and so i actually i support the ban and i think all of them should be executed and i think their owners
2096.60 2177.58 SPEAKER_04  should be executed as well you know i i think about there's there's a certain kind of self-delusion disconnect from reality that i think all dog owners i mean to some extent parents are also just guilty of this in the sense that they have a completely detached uh concept of eugenics to breed my gigantic sons yeah exactly uh they have a like a kind of unrealistic perception of how other people interact with their dog and or child but i mean i think this particularly manifests with dogs because i mean if you're if your child runs up and rips the face off of a smaller child then like people are like okay this is a crime there's a problem whereas with dogs damn that kid's hard no they're just they're just having fun um but i would say i recall this it's it's unrelated but i think it speaks to this mentality of just the the detachment from the detachment from the real world that you'll perceive with with these people sometimes and that is i remember seeing a video of people being like oh isn't it funny our little yappy dog fucking terrier loves basically barking at an alligator this is like in florida and everyone's like you know at the backyard there's the alligator the little yappy dog's like haha it barks and they're filming it like haha it barks it barks it's like it's chasing down prehistoric killer lizard chasing chasing down barking barking harassing this alligator and the alligator just fucking eats the goddamn dog and just jumps into the basically grabs it and you hear one last yelp and it goes very quickly under the water and everyone screams smash cut
2177.58 2216.86 SPEAKER_05  video ends and it's like this is like my fantasy whenever someone has one of those really annoying yappy small dogs like at the pub or something like your dog should not be a london pub i'm fucking sorry there needs to be a london alligator service yeah exactly like every every london pub especially in like the fucking the bougie postcodes we're talking like your hackney zero islington's there needs to be a fucking pub alligator that will eat your fucking annoying french bulldog because it's pissing me off i once saw someone brought a french bulldog into a pub on broadway market and then like all these like annoying people were like going like oh it's so cute everyone's like coming out of the dog and then the dog did a fart which like cleared out the entire pub that's one of the reasons why i
2216.86 2278.80 SPEAKER_04  hate it with people like have their like uh you know emotional support whatever animal you know if it's not like a thing that's actually like when people use it as an excuse to not pay the uh the fee for transporting a pet i'm not talking about when people have the trained dogs that are like guide dog that's a completely different thing but in america in particular there's this tendency and people would try it with like emotional emotional support rabbits and peacocks and whatever the fuck animal they wanted to bring in a plane emotional support peacock when it fans out the feathers full in coach is that it uh is that they'll like fart and shit and throw up places and like it's disgusting it smells awful and sometimes throw up shit yeah sometimes well yeah exactly i i i i i remember seeing a guy years ago whose parents were lebanese talking about like i don't really like my dad and i don't really get along with him but the one thing that i agree with is dogs are disgusting and don't belong in the house i don't hate dogs to that extent but i i'm not like broken up that we don't have a dog because like they are gross and it's just it's just a fact of life they'll do gross things you're not even allowed a peacock yeah exactly but i imagine having a south london peacock would be just a bridge too far
2278.80 2319.60 SPEAKER_03  he's a fucking peacock if you are i mean if you yeah if you are gonna like find a londoner with a peacock like it will probably be there my my former neighbor had used to have down right lane not up where i live i'll be real with you my my former neighbor had like a pet monkey apparently this was before i moved in um but she had a pet monkey you live next door to riley's grandfather that's right yeah there's a monkey called barba um no she had a monkey and the reason why i know this was because my parents store was near where i used to live and um when i was a child and i don't remember this but the customer used to come in with her pet monkey like on her shoulder um and my dad was really annoyed by it because the monkey would like nick like steel sweets and like chewing gum and stuff
2319.60 2331.02 SPEAKER_04  from like the counter monkey nicked me chewing gum sounds like an american doing a particularly inarticulate parody of life in britain i've heard of paying peanuts which is fucking ridiculous
2331.02 2337.26 SPEAKER_03  um yeah so like yeah if you are going to find like weird animals in this in this in this great
2337.26 2347.14 SPEAKER_04  city like normally when you see like cheeky fox nicks man's mobile that's like a pair that it's a real headline but it gets shared by americans to make fun of britain yeah but yeah it's monkey
2347.14 2351.98 SPEAKER_03  this monkey nicked me nicked me chewing gum and me wife he said all the poppers off the top shelf
2351.98 2359.46 SPEAKER_05  and all the copies of max power is that i think mr patel's fuming is that this
2359.46 2441.66 SPEAKER_04  the disconnect between perception and reality that many pet owners and dog owners particularly have i think britain is not i don't know if it's unique in that regard in the sense that i think that americans definitely do this but i think that here i i don't want to say that it's because it's like a monoculture but i just think that like there's a lot more there's a combination of like what's the right word here like kind of implied consent and and a culture of like passive aggressive bullshit where people just just sort of do stuff and like in the same way that i tried to explain to my american friend who's a bartender that like on numerous occasions when recently when i've been in pubs in britain someone has just come up to my table and put their empties like their empty pint glasses on my table and walked away and the the person who's lived in britain in me is like well fucking whatever whereas the american me wants to be like this is going up your ass you know what i mean because we just wouldn't fucking do that yeah like yeah get the fucking pub alligator i've got a job for it exactly exactly it's like find that man the puffy coat who thinks he's farting subtly and surreptitiously and is not at all eat his ass not that way no what what i'm trying to say though is that yeah i think that i think that americans are like this too but but i i am not aware also because the fact that this isn't really a thing that correct me if i'm wrong here i'm not sure this isn't the kind of thing that even if the federal government did it in america that it would attract this level or maybe it wouldn't have in the past maybe now it would i don't know everything becomes a
2441.66 2445.94 SPEAKER_01  co-celeb because of like boomers on facebook well these bullies they're very they're very large
2445.94 2451.52 SPEAKER_05  we're all looking into it says that is that is that this is biden's xl bully that's just bill
2451.52 2471.24 SPEAKER_01  clinton no bill bill would be different that would be oh i've heard of these xl bullies they got it yet now i've heard of a big dog in my time this is a pretty big dog i'm here trying to get a blowjob there's a dog licking my balls i mean look it's pretty weird
2471.24 2477.72 SPEAKER_04  once again this is just drifting off into a reality that's got folks have you heard of these bullies
2477.72 2520.20 SPEAKER_02  they're very very large they're very big you thought the regular bully it was big but then they got the xl bully they didn't want the medium size no they don't they got a very big dog it's so big it's bigger than joe it could eat him it could eat him oh they gotta keep him away he's not allowed in the same room no no everyone's just screaming should we bring it out folks clifford is he still allowed they don't know they won't say that is it gonna be put down it's gonna take a very large syringe to put down clifford the big red dog they're making it right now in china they're bringing it over on a special train it's a syringe as big as a house
2520.20 2557.66 SPEAKER_05  anyway yes so on the there was all this discourse starting about maybe banning xl bullies in the uk and and that meant on 23rd of september we got the save our xl bullies march where all of the xl bully owners said uh we're gonna prove that it's the the owner not the dog and so we're gonna get everyone together all the xl bully owners uh without the dogs and they sort of proved the point in like the opposite way to the way they were intending to where it's like because yeah look at because i was responsible xl bully owners and then everyone looked at the xl bully owners and we were like i'm not sure how responsible these people are well it was also
2557.66 2691.16 SPEAKER_03  because initially when the ad went out it was like oh no yeah definitely bring your xl bully because again we're trying to prove that this is not a dog issue this is a owner issue until someone pointed out that oh my xl bully might freak out if he's like around loads of other dogs right and people or people or just like being outside alligators yeah and so and and i think and though other people they're like yeah i'm not sure if it's necessarily a good idea and then again this was a very interesting choice of language i remember what reading some of the comments where it was just like oh i trust my xl bully to be on their best behavior but i'm not sure about other people's xl bullies and i'm really worried if i bring my kids someone else's xl bully or like someone else's bully dog will like attack my child and so it was still very basically like gun owners if the gun was alive i think yeah uh basically um but there was also i think also this sort of like you're not this suspicion may not be the right word but this sort of being convinced that actually you're a really good gun owner like you're a really good dog owner um and that actually like this issue is everyone else's problem and you are being punished for someone else's problem and this is where i thought it was really interesting in terms of like trying to understand some of the problems like a lot of these sort of issues in britain where i think the tendency especially like among quite a lot of people like or at least like a non-significant amount of people is this insistence that like i'm not the problem other people are and i'm being punished for someone else's problems without sort of recognizing that like either you are contributing to the problem just by like the nature of doing what you're doing or that no this is sort of like a collective problem more broadly that does require some sort of policy like based solution that does impact people i think you can see that a lot with like ulez related stuff you can see that with like um you know even even like even sort of like low you know local local sort of like nimby like some nimby stuff where you know the tendency will be like oh like i'm doing fine and if other people are having problems then like they should fix it themselves but i shouldn't be inconvenienced by that except in this case like the inconvenience that these owners have is like i shouldn't have to like put a leash or a muzzle on my xl bully it should be allowed to just roam freely because i personally am a good think that i
2691.16 2732.78 SPEAKER_05  am a good person and because this is one of the big misconceptions with it like you know because we'll get into the videos but they're posting all these videos with like fucking arms of the angels playing and they're like yeah i'm having to put a muzzle on my dog look at him imprisoned in this muzzle it's like you have to put him in a muzzle for half an hour a day when you take him outside of your house for a walk the rest of the time he doesn't have to be in a leisure or muzzle because he's in your fucking house like they're acting as though like the government is doing like some fucking nazi program of like you know forced sterilization on all these dogs or whatever i mean they do actually well they do actually have to be neutered but that's quite common for dogs you should neuter your dog really um but like you know they're making it out to be this incredibly sinister thing when it's like you just need to have it on a lead in the muzzle when it's not in your house it's hardly like you
2732.78 2765.40 SPEAKER_04  know 1984 further to my argument that while it's primarily concentrated in the economic domain britain is actually the world's most libertarian country in so many ways because hey you know what this is the kind of thing this is this is this is this is not too many steps removed from you know my my girlfriend shouldn't have to wear a seat belt or a booster seat like level of libertarianism like it's just it's wild it's like it's a big dog they are dangerous because they're big and they're dogs it's like if you want to have the big dog you kind of have to whatever like libertarian guys hate the
2765.40 2771.90 SPEAKER_05  axel bully because it does pose a serious threat to their girlfriend i was gonna say in that photo
2771.90 2796.30 SPEAKER_04  that you've got from the protest that has the rishi sunak with the mask on his face and says muzzle rishi don't bully our breed i'm just looking at it because from a distance at an angle they've given rishi a face tattoo it looks like that mask looks like it's the silence of the lambs mask that hannibal or looks like half of the mask or something regardless it's the hardest photo of rishi sunak ever rishi sunak just needs to become bane and then he'll just win crushing majorities forever
2796.30 2801.84 SPEAKER_05  this is like rishi sunak's like pen and pixel cover right like rishi sunak he needs two xl bullies
2801.84 2826.82 SPEAKER_04  on leads stood in front of alexis it's very difficult to make rishi sunak look like physically threatening yeah like just no he's in the danger zone for xl bully attack i mean he's like five foot five if they fuck having a like a day of action mass protest just find rishi sunak and unleash the pack of xl bullies on him like uh legally do not do that oh i mean if like hypothetically speaking
2826.82 2832.44 SPEAKER_05  like if if one if you if you were trying to do the xl bully insurrection that would probably be the
2832.44 2865.16 SPEAKER_04  most efficient way we're not personally happy it's very frustrating that like due to just the the the lack of the lack of understanding that we can talk about china importing a huge syringe on a train to put down clifford the big red dog and the idea that pubs should have alligators that eat your dogs and or you and that's fine but then when you suggest that xl bully hunters should unleash their dogs on the prime minister then you're like oh actually like special branch might come and kick down our door with the big red dog shocks chinese restaurant owner by ordering in perfect manner
2865.16 2894.78 SPEAKER_03  well like i can imagine like if someone if someone was to sort of like take their time to listen to this in order to do like a kind of hit piece over like this socialist podcast is uh is that all this communist podcast is uh is um encouraging uh encouraging attacking the prime minister and then they're like looking for other examples of like you know uh instances that are like outrageous and it's all just like insane bits that like none of us remember that like milo came up with on the fly yeah i'm trying to think of like what would be the good ones but i think i think actually like
2894.78 3028.90 SPEAKER_04  that would be very entertaining what's interesting to me too though because i've experienced this also is that um certain things that are like uh animal either animal welfare or animal control tend to become like little pet issues for otherwise completely unknown members of parliament and so on and so forth and some of these issues wind up coming through so milo was pointing out uh there is in fact a new law that's starting starting now in this in the start of this came into effect this like the start of this year that uh it is against the law to sell an xl bully dog abandon an xl bully dog or let it stray give it give away an xl bully dog breed from an xl bully dog have an xl bully in public without a lead and muzzle i mean so for all intents and purposes they this they have banned this breed once again i think the you know the the specificity of it is such that like people could probably argue like no this dog isn't descended from like you know not descended from pimp babe or uh yeah it's not descended from alaskan thunderfuck or fucking mr worldwide a dog named keifer sutherland so it's just it's simply it's not an xl bully but i'm reminded on a side dog is only tangentially related to himless passion i i i i'm reminded of the fact that the the uk actually for example banned glue traps to catch mice uh unless you are a licensed exterminator you're not allowed to use them like it's you can get six months in prison for putting down glue traps to catch mice uh and because they say they're inhumane because the mice will either die of exposure or starve to death or uh you or you what you're supposed to do is take the trap and close it and then fucking hit it and crush the mouse and it's like i understand people are squeamish about this um but to to to riff on as someone who's when they were ripping up part of the outside the house try to fix the broken sewer pipe it mice started appearing someone who has dealt with mice in their house not for sanitary reasons just because fucking they they made a perfect little channel for the mice when people talk about you had to get your xl bullet exactly exactly and the pub alligator was booked up forever you can't get fucking shit in this country you know everything's always waitlisted but here's my thing when people go on about like oh it's so inhumane and to riff on a famous milo bit it's a fucking mouse
3028.90 3037.96 SPEAKER_05  yeah people watch stewart little and they all got very sentimental about mice
3037.96 3042.18 SPEAKER_00  oh do you know a mice it's actually very intelligent it knows how to fly a plane
3042.18 3051.84 SPEAKER_04  and it can drive a car the size of a shoe yeah it also apparently loves finding bags of coffee and chewing them open and then eating exactly one coffee bean and shitting everywhere
3051.84 3068.36 SPEAKER_03  then it shit makes great coffee that's unfair because one coffee bean might seem like you know very minuscule to you but so that mouse it is basically like downing like 10 10 espressos in one go and if i don't if i had 10 espressos in one go i would also probably shit uh that mouse was so
3068.36 3111.24 SPEAKER_04  fucking productive after that though yeah i mean in the same way i i look at this stuff and it's like i don't want to be too sanguine about it but like it's a dog it's a dog that is in fact dangerous no matter what because all dogs can do they are animals and can can freak out or if they get sick or something like they their behavior can change and like as milo pointed out a small dog you basically pet it too hard and its spine breaks but they can still hurt you and just in the same way that like a fucking ferret can hurt you god knows i wouldn't want to deal with a goddamn ferret especially if you put it down your trousers angry ferret you know what i mean bad bad idea um and so i guess i just point this out that like the the level of of outrage and sentimentality about it is what always
3111.24 3143.00 SPEAKER_05  kind of weirds me out but it's so funny i mean we'll get into the videos in a sec but the contrast of just like the music and the like look look at my dog you wouldn't know fly and it's just like an image of the most terrifying dog you've ever seen like just like growling at the camera um yeah so a crucial detail is that this law only applies in england and wales so xl bullies haven't been banned in scotland so according to the bbc one man called sammy wilkinson has been driving van fulls of xl bullies to scotland oh my god this is the new fault line in british politics scotland is
3143.00 3154.30 SPEAKER_04  like a refuge for the xl bully oh no someone left a pack of cheese slices in the back of that van the dude staggers out of it in scotland like fucking mutated like the dude from the first robocop
3154.30 3189.44 SPEAKER_05  exterminated by dog farts yeah um so uh i wanted to get into the the insanity portion uh so this is from uh indy 100 talking to tiktok an xl bully owner recently posted a video taking their muzzled dog out on a walk on a lead with one of the owners wearing a muzzle to support the dog 31st of december 23 our first walk with rollo with the new restrictions and laws against xl bullies daniel rose wrote aiden supporting rollo today by wearing a muzzle and making conversation with passers-by to show our animals should not be demonized by a muzzle or the law this is just
3189.44 3199.76 SPEAKER_04  that that great british images account photo the getty stock photo of the guy basically bathing or bathing inside a huge english breakfast to protest some sense of agreement about english breakfast like
3199.76 3219.00 SPEAKER_05  she added it's a sad sad day for dog communities so um if you want to watch the video i linked it i linked it in the show notes um i'm gonna play it for me and nate in the studio of course it's got some kind of like uh soft house music it is sort of borderline kink isn't it like walking around in a muzzle with
3219.00 3232.62 SPEAKER_04  your dog i mean get a big sandwich board and wear it otherwise yeah it just looks like i mean from a distance it just looks like someone wearing a mask because of because of covid or because of preventing illness and then when you get up close you're like oh you're also a bane cosplayer
3232.62 3246.56 SPEAKER_03  yeah because like well i was gonna add but like if you're gonna like my issue with this and i know i understand this might be like somewhat specific but if you're trying to like show that your dog has been like victimized and a prisoner and anything and everything like it should really look a lot less like bane
3246.56 3254.48 SPEAKER_05  my dog has to wear a muscle because it blew up an american football stadium
3254.48 3339.76 SPEAKER_03  it's like on a purely aesthetic level i feel like yeah there are probably better ways to sort of show and maybe this is it like i feel like a lot of the content that i've seen which is really trying to convince you that like these dogs are being victimized they sort of come off as this kind of weird because it's not they're not really doing a particularly good job of it and i feel like part of that is just because they are only really talking to like other dog owners um and so like and again like they're talking to a very specific kind of dog owner because as we've sort of established like you know the xl like the xl bullies are not wild like widely loved by other dog owners they're like you know you can find like other dogs like you know staffies uh like other types of bulldogs or whatever well like even if someone doesn't own that kind of dog they will sort of see it as this collective like you know we are dog owners and stuff but they don't really do that with the xl bully and so in some ways like the xl bully owners have this license to feel like further victimized because they can be like oh you know the public doesn't support us the government doesn't support us and other dog owners don't really support us either but then that really only means that they are just talking to themselves um and it becomes like more and more absurd as you try to sort of like cast yourself as a victim bearing in mind that like the rules in place have not been like we're going to execute every xl bully you know the rules have really been like very despite what tiktok might tell you exactly well you know and just and just like you know or despite like what these owners have said about oh they're going to like euthanize the dogs and everything using the big injection that they're
3339.76 3344.98 SPEAKER_04  flying in from china um they're going to be fed to clifford the bit right now no they're just doing
3344.98 3360.26 SPEAKER_03  managed decline on the xl believers like they're not even so yeah but they're not even like sort of like the blood thirstiness isn't there they're just like oh can you keep your like insanely dangerous dog like on a leash please and they're and they see that as like being like the ultimate form of
3360.26 3391.62 SPEAKER_05  victimization um so uh now i want to move on to some screenshots i took from facebook um uh hasain would you like to open up in the in the folder of images uh there's one that's about uh it's the fourth one down called mxlk so that's this one so this is a picture of an xl bully dog in black and white and in sort of comic sans this is also incredibly deep fried like every single one of these has been screenshotted and reposted a thousand times i have a dream that one day i will not be judged by my
3391.62 3406.90 SPEAKER_03  appearance but by the content of my character you want your dog to be judged by the like the reason you buy the dog that's the reason you buy them is because they look a certain way and that's not just what the xl bullies that's for like basically every kind of dog i mean i'll be
3406.90 3485.74 SPEAKER_04  real with you growing up in indiana i used to mow pastures as a job like after school and in the summer and one of the people i mowed pastures for they had this problem they loved irish wolfhounds but they also had barn cats to keep mice etc out of their barns problem with irish wolfhounds is they love playing with cats and killing them because when an irish wolfhound chases a cat and catches it it shakes the fuck out of it and basically breaks every important bone in its body and it's like irish wolfhound and tiny little purse size yappy dog probably shouldn't rough and tumble play and xl bullies not an irish wolfhound i think there is there is certainly a classism element here but like both those like both those dogs are going to be dangerous and i think the idea that i don't think that it's one particular owner group is this way because i feel like lots of dog owners this way but like unwillingness to accept like like like you said earlier milo they're not euthanizing these dogs they're just they're making it so you can't buy more of them it's not that restrictive like anything in the uk like will it actually be enforced probably selectively because that's just the way this country is like because in this country the cops don't the cops are dickheads don't get me wrong but they also basically don't get paid anything and so like it something has to be pretty serious
3485.74 3505.20 SPEAKER_05  for them to do anything at all and yeah and also i don't know i don't know what this is like in the in the states but just to just to head this off at the past some people have suggested there's like a racial element to this every single person i've seen posted about this is white i have not seen a single non-white person doing insane xl bullet posts at any point and i would make the point
3505.20 3552.32 SPEAKER_04  that in america i think it is racialized but in the sense that pit bull owners pit bulls are seen as a dog black people own um the immediate association between pit bulls and dog fighting uh is also something where people see like if you're familiar with the whole story with michael vick who was i believe the quarterback for the atlanta falcons and uh he um oh yeah he killed a bunch of dogs he was doing dog fighting in his house and got i think got convicted like yeah it was it was you know it smell crazy in there uh yeah for and so um i don't but yeah as milo pointed out here in the uk at least this is 1000 a white people thing yeah um um has saying can you can you open the
3552.32 3565.94 SPEAKER_03  photo labeled put down sunak uh i love that there's one called put down sunak and then one put down the nonsense um we'll get there put down sunak so yeah this is him and he looks like a cat boy yeah
3565.94 3587.40 SPEAKER_04  they tried to draw devil horns on him but it made him look like a cat boy this is the only xl bully in the uk that needs putting down for all our safeties i also like the fucking thomas paines common sense ass capitalization that people always use like why is putting and down capitalized but the rest isn't like it's just it's just a facebook boomer affect i feel like you can yeah you can call you can
3587.40 3594.14 SPEAKER_03  call rishi sunak many things like he'll xl probably is not no he's the excess bully excess bully yeah i
3594.14 3633.90 SPEAKER_05  think we can now open the one i've called put down the nonces uh this is what i think probably my favorite facebook post that i found um this is a woman who says why not give all the xl bullies a life in specialized kennels creating new jobs for people to look after them in terror bang and then get all the pedophiles and use the injections the poor xl bullies were getting and get rid of the whole damn lot of them these are the real animals the ones who destroy lives give them the injection not a poor defenseless dog who has no clue what's going on and are labeled monsters because of how they look i'd happily sit in a room full of xl bullies over sitting in a room with a certain disgusting scruffy wanker of a pedo hashtag just saying so we should send all the pedos to the vets to be put down
3633.90 3703.76 SPEAKER_04  but also what if we just muzzled the pedo what if yeah what if you could only walk your pet pedophile around with them i mean i just that that is such a i don't know the the immediate jumping to like you know either we have homeless veterans therefore why can't we x or what about the pedos because of y is i'm not going to say it's unfamiliar to me as an american but maybe it's just the funny spelling of how they spell pedophile here i can't believe i said it the british way uh or maybe it's just the fact that it seems to come up so much in a country that's like that's why i've got an excel bully to hunt pedos with it well also a country that's just sort of like everything about it is built head to toe on just like systematic child abuse it's always very funny this comes up as the kind of like co-celeb uh people are scared of an excel bully but comfortably allowed a pedo to walk the streets makes you think yeah we sure we sure do live in society what what comfortably allow i mean there's not there's not like a like a like a special you know bred by by science a bed by dr yakub fucking physiognomy that shows that someone you know what i mean like it's just it's very strange
3703.76 3761.60 SPEAKER_05  there is there is no more opprobrium life available to someone than being a convicted pedophile in this country there is no there is no subgroup of people that people openly hate more um like so i don't i don't understand where they're coming from with this um yeah there's also there's this image i've called dog centaur which is where we start getting to the really weird ai images oh my fucking god this was posted by a romanian man who lives in the uk it says human canine bonding is the relationship between dogs and humans this relationship can be traced back at least 15 000 years to the bon overcastle dog who was found buried alongside two humans for centuries dogs have been considered a man's best friend this is most evident in western countries such as the us where over 48 percent of households own a pet dog and then it's got a picture of like an anthropomorphic dog like the head of a dog like kind of like anubis but it's like a ripped man but his left leg is the body of a dog which is so he has like five legs like one human leg and then the body of a dog and
3761.60 3781.76 SPEAKER_04  then four dog legs yeah and it's it it's a floppy eared dog too i can't remember what breed that is but it's just it looks a bit like a boxer maybe me yeah i what it's just but the human side body is like makes brad pitt in fight club look out of shape like it's the most jacked dog human what if there
3781.76 3787.48 SPEAKER_03  was a jacked dog man what what about then yeah and what if that jacked dog man had five legs whenever
3787.48 3805.68 SPEAKER_04  i see a really disturbing anthropomorphic dog i always think of the the japanese uh potato chip company was a consume a ponchi and those very strange videos with the dog um but that figurine looks like it would you'd have to go to a special shop in japan to buy it and it would have orifices
3805.68 3809.66 SPEAKER_05  some other honorable mentions uh hussein please open up the file called giant bully
3809.66 3816.18 SPEAKER_03  uh i'm looking forward to this giant bully this is an ai image of like a 30 foot high excel bully
3816.18 3821.60 SPEAKER_05  presiding over like a kind of garden of eden of cherubs and toddlers and small excel bullies
3821.60 3828.92 SPEAKER_04  he's in he's in heaven with all the children he killed and like there's like a kid there or like
3828.92 3834.50 SPEAKER_03  on the right hand side but the kid sort of also looks like he has a dog face so presumably this is like
3834.50 3841.04 SPEAKER_04  one of the dog wow yeah look on the right oh yeah oh that's awesome that means that he's fucked some
3841.04 3854.40 SPEAKER_03  of the humans and he's created yeah human hybrid this is this is both baby they're not humans they're children so this implies that like in this heaven the dogs are kind of nonsense so so so basically oh
3854.40 3860.28 SPEAKER_04  yeah and also this is actually a dire warning to the consequences of kissing your dog on the mouth
3860.28 3882.02 SPEAKER_03  because eventually this happens well there's also like some really fucked up baby so like it looks like also also some of the babies are like are dead in this like yeah yeah so so what we've established so what from what we've established in this photo the dogs fuck the babies and also still kill the babies in this in this heaven it's amazing again not necessarily the best pr like like a rabbit eating
3882.02 3900.20 SPEAKER_05  it's young but it's an exo bully so also an honorable mention to the one called sunak hell which is near the bottom of the list which is where they photoshopped it so then it looks like rishi sunak is in hell but the devil is like thanos and it just says enjoy your fate this was posted completely seriously
3900.20 3906.30 SPEAKER_03  and he looks like mildly disappointed but like not sort of not really not really phased by it
3906.30 3912.98 SPEAKER_04  yeah again hard album cover rishi sunak in hell but also with like the default stock text you can
3912.98 3952.20 SPEAKER_05  add on to shit in whatsapp oh yeah 100% um and then i just wanted to add this because this was the one like really funny like everyone was doing insane posting on this excel bully group and then i found this one guy who was just like on a lighter note it's like perfect like boomer like this post it has like the um so this is one at the bottom where it's like says like barbecues or whatever this guy uh has got has done the like the graphic memoji with a with a megaphone 2024 i want to see the uk bully scene stand back up on its feet don't let the excel predicament kill our momentum bully fam let's get back out there with our productions where's the linkups and barbecues i mean look at
3952.20 4021.40 SPEAKER_04  the end of the day i have no idea how to comprehend this maybe just because it's not a thing i mean like you know taking care of friends dogs my parents had dogs i loved when i back when they were still alive when i'd go my parents are still alive back when i'd go see my parents in indiana and their dogs were still alive the big fucking uh great pyrenees i'd hang out with them get knocked over by them it was fun you know kind of gross because they'd lick you and you get mega slobbered on but like whatever but i'm just taken aback by this level of vitriol i suppose i mean because notionally here if you own an excel bully the only thing that changes in your life here is you have to put a muzzle on the dog when you take it outside and you can't get more in england you can go to scotland but you can't in england and you can't breed you want to fuck your dog you have to go to scotland yeah and you can't breed from them thereby thereby creating siring more bully excel bullies so you you can still keep your dog you can still if you like your dog you can keep it you can still have the dog and so this isn't a situation where they're going to euthanize them as i am unless i think ones that are in rescue
4021.40 4039.96 SPEAKER_05  kennels might end up getting euthanized but that that happens with loads of dogs that are in rescue kennels anyway regardless of their breed and if you really cared about the fate of dogs in rescue kennels why wouldn't you rescue a dog from a kennel rather than buying an excel bully for four grand from a dog because dog breeders are famously the reason why so many dogs end up in fucking rescue
4039.96 4086.80 SPEAKER_04  shelters and get put and i don't know if legally you could rehome a dog that was in a shelter that was an excel bully in scotland i have no idea what that loophole is but i do like the idea that i've never rehomed an excel bully i imagine it might be quite inconvenient i'd love the idea that you you you you you're driving you're driving north getting clear out of england you know i can't remember what is it is it uh barrow the the town what is it the border that's right on the on the border uh barrack on tweet yeah barrack on tweet and uh barrow in furnace is up there as well yeah yeah barrack on tweet and uh then you cross over and as soon as you cross the border it's just roving gangs of excel bullies they've all got like the soul tire like yeah yeah yeah fucking like the video game music turns scary and minor key as soon as you get up there like yeah it's just can't get away from
4086.80 4098.16 SPEAKER_05  them yeah that's right um so bad news for scotland's toddlers uh watch out if you're north of the border um right i think that is i mean there's there's more we could say about the excel bully but i think
4098.16 4173.36 SPEAKER_03  that is about tears it there were a lot of there were a lot of tiktoks which like i know we haven't talked about but maybe worth like putting into like you know yeah like extra extra content uh because those tiktoks extra large to content the tiktoks and videos are really like i did just want to like make one very last comment about the protest that i think joe uh the the website joe went to and that was really funny uh just because they were obviously like again it sort of speaks to how people are trying to sort of triangulate this problem with them knowing that like they have these dangerous dogs but they're like desperately trying to convince themselves that like other people are the problem and not them and that one guy who like was going to take his excel bully but decided not to so decides to just bring his leash instead but his leash looks like a um you know one of those like but those like title belts that you win at but like in boxing and stuff yeah yeah yeah and like that's the thing that he puts around the neck it looks like yeah it looks like one of those sort of title belts but it has like the spikes on it as well it's just like yeah again it's like you know if you're gonna like if you're gonna make the case of this dog is just innocent like everything else you've gotta gotta like soften the aesthetic a little bit right add a bow add a bow or two onto it or onto it like you know um like put it in some like sort of pastel like instagram back like backdrops yeah but i gotta
4173.36 4221.76 SPEAKER_04  be weird though i gotta be real with you some of those are always really weird looking like when people try to do like all these dogs are cuddly here's here's my my pit bull you know next to a baby it to me it just all i mean they're i just never found them to be particularly cute dogs it looks like you've just given up your child as sacrifice to jabba the hut in those photos like it's just weird but i don't know like some people like those dogs great i just think that it's you know none of this none of this feels like like it has to be as big of a thing but i i take your point points milo and hussein that people in this country who own dogs or love dogs are insane about them in a particularly intense way um i do think that if they were trying to do something that affected all dog owners it would be like instant electoral suicide kind of thing yeah i think that would possibly be a
4221.76 4226.04 SPEAKER_05  kind of like insurrection i think we'd have a kind of storming of the winter palace and i think that
4226.04 4242.06 SPEAKER_04  was a good point about the the pen farthing thing or whatever that like no no afghan no afghan civilians can come over uh we're a little bit hesitant on the afghans who were like our interpreters that uh we're absolutely leaving to be killed but uh yeah and we don't want the taliban are gonna re-home
4242.06 4248.84 SPEAKER_05  the xl bully is this like an xl bully and a kufi in kabul alhamdulillah i mean i'll be i'll be honest
4248.84 4274.62 SPEAKER_04  with you the dogs that afghans use for protection for their homes they keep on chains they don't let them inside but they there's a kind of herding dog that kuchi people uh the the sort of like migrant like like nomadic passion people keep with their herds that could probably do a number on xl bullies like it's fucking big as hell so i do actually like the idea that the the taliban re-home the xl bullies so that their dogs can kill them yeah i mean well look if you want to defend
4274.62 4279.80 SPEAKER_05  your home get a donkey they're very territorial they famously they use them to protect sheep no no
4279.80 4313.80 SPEAKER_04  no no if you want to defend your home get a fucking rabbit apparently because like they were gonna be like get a revolver yeah get get a rabbit they for some reason now rabbits obviously easy to fall victim to other animals so get a ferret to kill the other predators that are trying to kill your self-defense rabbit i'm just saying this just feels like a kind of group psychosis and i don't know i i uh uh i'd be a little bit more sympathetic if um if as we talked about in the beginning of the episode my uh my beloved home adopted home of south london wasn't also the place you step in xl bullies
4313.80 4327.70 SPEAKER_05  shit yeah exactly so anyway um i don't know if you've got anything else milo i don't think so no i think this is about it we had some more tiktoks but i think we just we can't get into that we'll be here another 45 minutes um so i think this is about you know all it remains to do is thank hussein very
4327.70 4336.54 SPEAKER_03  much for joining us yeah thanks for your time hussein it's always a pleasure to be on and to talk about my favorite thing but i know loads about both dogs and dogging yeah well i mean at the end
4336.54 4347.70 SPEAKER_04  of the day i know you love dogs you love being around them nothing makes you happier and less stressed so what better topic to uh to bring you on i mean like one yeah i mean one thing i was going
4347.70 4370.92 SPEAKER_03  to bring up but i'm not going to just because of time but it was a whole other segment of just like unleash dogs as like a general british phenomena and the fact that like last year i was working in an office or i was working in a we work where they had a sort of bring your pets to work thing all the time and so like you could not be in any sort of communal space without someone's fucking dog just like because you didn't have the we work alligator and that's why they went
4370.92 4374.64 SPEAKER_04  bro you should have you should have brought in your pet alligator and be like yeah well you said bring
4374.64 4388.40 SPEAKER_03  your pets it wasn't specific adam newman with music for alligators so yeah all i was gonna say is like yeah i think i think they're like the bigger issue here is just like the unleashing but that maybe you can do that like some other time or unleash the alligators but either way
4388.40 4415.40 SPEAKER_05  if you listen to this thank you very much for being a patreon subscriber we're going to be coming at you with more britonology later in this month on the ten dollar tier so keep your eyes peeled for that um yeah and check out 10k posts you know who hussein is yeah do that um do that yeah we we've never met before is that right we don't know him at all we're just we're just we're just weirdly over yeah he's not an audience plant um yeah um okay cool and we'll see you all very soon bye
4415.40 4416.12 SPEAKER_04  bye bye
