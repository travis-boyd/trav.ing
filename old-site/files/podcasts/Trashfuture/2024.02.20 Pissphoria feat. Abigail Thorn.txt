88.08 88.98 SPEAKER_02  You inherit it.
89.18 91.28 SPEAKER_02  Home taping is killing podcasts.
92.40 98.14 SPEAKER_02  And I want to introduce our guest. It is Abby Thorne once again. Abby, how's it going?
98.22 100.90 SPEAKER_07  Hello, hello, hello. It's nice to be here. Always a delight to be on TF.
101.16 105.28 SPEAKER_02  So we've got a few news items to cover. One of which is something...
105.28 106.94 SPEAKER_02  Those keep happening, for fuck's sake.
106.94 110.74 SPEAKER_02  Some of which is going to be a little bit of UK politics.
111.12 113.08 SPEAKER_01  That keeps happening too, for fuck's sake.
113.92 120.50 SPEAKER_02  Mostly today what we're going to be talking about is transphobes continuing to be viciously anti-normal.
120.74 122.96 SPEAKER_01  You know what? That keeps happening as well.
123.48 124.02 SPEAKER_01  More and more.
124.88 128.06 SPEAKER_02  Time is a flat circle, I feel. Strongly.
128.36 130.76 SPEAKER_02  However, before we do that, a couple of news items.
130.76 146.72 SPEAKER_02  Number one, finally, Keir Starmer, after announcing that he promises to not have an industrial strategy, to respect any kind of mad tax cuts that Jeremy Hunt puts through, because he's going to try something new, Jeremy Hunt. He's going to try...
146.72 149.38 SPEAKER_02  There's only one mad Jeremy that Keir Starmer will respect.
149.94 150.40 SPEAKER_05  It is.
150.60 151.42 SPEAKER_05  And let me tell you...
151.42 152.06 SPEAKER_01  Clarkson.
152.30 153.16 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, that's right.
153.58 156.24 SPEAKER_05  I think what he's doing with that farm is very admirable.
156.24 161.02 SPEAKER_05  It's great for the economy of Oxfordshire, and it's great for blokes who enjoy machinery.
161.34 167.06 SPEAKER_02  So, what Hunt is doing is he's doing an experiment in governing the British state.
167.20 169.70 SPEAKER_02  This is pushing the frontiers of what it's possible to do.
169.96 174.74 SPEAKER_02  He will be cutting funding to pay for tax cuts to stimulate growth in the economy.
175.32 176.90 SPEAKER_07  Wow, we've never tried that.
177.32 185.60 SPEAKER_01  Well, the thing is, right, this is also the thing that, if we recall, mere moments ago, under Liz Truss, like, crashed the economy instantly.
186.24 191.32 SPEAKER_02  Oh, no, but they're going to be funded this time, because it's going to be tax cuts plus spending cuts.
191.32 192.38 SPEAKER_02  It's going to be great.
192.50 195.48 SPEAKER_05  Don't worry, we're reducing the UK to one cop.
196.04 197.70 SPEAKER_05  He's going to be so busy.
198.10 205.80 SPEAKER_02  However, however, looking at this, Keir Starmer has stood up and bravely said, The one cop should be a woman.
206.10 206.74 SPEAKER_02  No, he has stood up...
206.74 210.04 SPEAKER_01  See, I interviewed for this, and it's nice to have that support.
210.04 211.38 SPEAKER_02  Not that kind of woman.
211.38 217.20 SPEAKER_02  He has stood up and he has bravely said, No more energy drinks for under-sixteens.
217.52 218.38 SPEAKER_02  That's right.
218.58 222.06 SPEAKER_00  Getting to grips with the real issues of our times.
222.36 223.04 SPEAKER_00  The big problems.
223.12 227.78 SPEAKER_00  There is a monster haunting Britain, and that monster exists on every corner.
229.08 231.64 SPEAKER_05  I don't think children can be trusted with wings.
232.64 234.42 SPEAKER_05  Some of them are too young to drive.
234.42 252.54 SPEAKER_01  The thing is, right, energy drinks are legitimately terrible for you, and it is kind of bad, as one of about a million ultra-processed food things, that now you can't be a teenager, or an adult for that matter, anymore, without being extremely caffeinated all the time.
252.96 269.54 SPEAKER_01  But I tend to view this mostly as a return to old labour instincts, but it's like the dead hand of power, because when Blair or Brown did this, they needed a sort of a Jamie Oliver figure, right, to pilot this mecca, to drive this thing through.
269.54 270.02 SPEAKER_01  A Jamie Oliver mecca!
270.02 271.46 SPEAKER_01  An Anthony Warrell Thompson!
271.58 274.56 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, get in the mecca, otherwise Anthony Warrell Thompson will have to do it again.
274.92 278.36 SPEAKER_01  But, like, this time, it's just purely off their own bat.
278.42 284.60 SPEAKER_01  It's just like, what can we do to, you know, make society a bit more repressive and controlling?
284.60 289.98 SPEAKER_01  Let's just do some nanny stage shit, let's ban kids from drinking horrible energy drinks they get off TikTok.
289.98 292.46 SPEAKER_01  Anthony Warrell Thompson's shoplifting Eva.
292.46 293.52 SPEAKER_05  Shoplifting cheese in America?
293.72 297.22 SPEAKER_05  Giant, giant, stop me now, security guard!
297.58 301.70 SPEAKER_07  It's not really shoplifting at that point, it's kind of escalated to mecca-armed robbery.
302.36 311.34 SPEAKER_02  I like to imagine Starmer as a kind of loose Roman emperor, just sort of throwing figs at what he's going to ban next.
311.48 314.04 SPEAKER_01  You know, too much sugar in figs, you can't be doing that.
314.04 324.88 SPEAKER_01  If you want an easy-to-understand, normal metaphor to understand what this means, imagine Starmer as a Roman emperor throwing figs at a mecca piloted by Anthony Warrell Thompson.
325.40 326.06 SPEAKER_01  That's right.
327.06 329.12 SPEAKER_06  Are you following along at home?
329.44 334.68 SPEAKER_01  Please subscribe to the Patreon so we can finally get some carbon monoxide detectors for the studio.
335.78 337.34 SPEAKER_02  But he has to be one of the later ones.
337.44 338.60 SPEAKER_02  You know, I don't mean, like, Nerva.
338.82 340.98 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, no, we mean, like, Septimus Severus or something.
341.14 342.42 SPEAKER_02  But you can't spell Nerva without Nerv.
342.42 344.74 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, so, not Elagabalus.
345.22 354.48 SPEAKER_02  Anyway, this is, like, yes, it is, as you say, Nerva, it is clearly bad for children to be, like, giving themselves cardiac episodes.
354.74 354.98 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
355.36 358.64 SPEAKER_02  By, like, drinking, again, by drinking sort of sweet things marketed to them.
359.00 367.18 SPEAKER_02  But, again, like, when you think about what the priorities are, what he wants to use the power of the state to do, it's just to take stuff away.
367.80 376.26 SPEAKER_01  And, yeah, and kids aren't only drinking these because they're available, they're also drinking them to take the edge off everything else about being in Britain, being insanely stressful.
376.34 382.16 SPEAKER_00  I was going to say that, like, you know, I'm currently in a stage in my life where I'm sort of having to work in a shop for a little bit.
382.16 390.30 SPEAKER_00  And, like, so I've had my first attempt, my first-hand experience of selling these awful products to children as if I am, like, a legal drug dealer.
390.96 392.16 SPEAKER_00  And, like, you're right.
392.20 396.48 SPEAKER_00  I think in the sense for, like, you know, a lot of these kids just buy these things, like, and vapes included as well.
396.48 401.90 SPEAKER_00  It's because, like, they're bored and there is literally nothing else to do except for, sort of, like, get high on whatever you can.
401.90 411.46 SPEAKER_00  And, like, in Britain, that has sort of always been kind of the culmination of, like, what I would sort of define youth culture as, just whereas nothing to do in your shitty little town.
412.02 418.60 SPEAKER_00  And so until you have the money to move into London to go buy more expensive drugs, you have to sort of deal with what you have right now.
419.76 421.64 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, until you ascend to, like...
421.64 431.10 SPEAKER_00  And if you're in a shitty little town, your drugs of choice are caffeinated drinks, over sweet vapes, and, like, if some guy, like, has, like, the worst weed you've ever smoked in your life.
431.40 441.78 SPEAKER_00  All of which is to say, I feel like Keir Starmer is really looking after the little man here, and that is, like, the guy in your school that will sell you the worst weed that you can imagine.
442.34 445.66 SPEAKER_01  Well, that's the last business left in Britain now.
446.54 451.30 SPEAKER_07  Hussein, I'm imagining you trying to give a lecture on structural causes of malaise to, like, a 15-year-old.
451.42 453.24 SPEAKER_07  You say, no, you don't want this monster.
453.40 455.98 SPEAKER_07  You think you do because of austerity.
455.98 460.42 SPEAKER_00  I had this debate with a child because they wanted to, like, they wanted to buy...
460.42 461.96 SPEAKER_00  It gets worse.
462.04 462.50 SPEAKER_00  It gets worse.
462.56 462.98 SPEAKER_00  It gets worse.
463.06 464.94 SPEAKER_00  I had a debate with a child because...
464.94 465.76 SPEAKER_00  Did you win?
465.90 467.12 SPEAKER_00  Did you win first?
467.20 467.64 SPEAKER_00  No, I lost.
467.84 473.64 SPEAKER_00  They wanted to buy this cheap energy drink, and I was like, look, dude, you want to go for, like, go get something a bit more premium?
474.12 476.52 SPEAKER_00  Have you looked at, sort of, the monster fruit punch?
476.84 477.18 SPEAKER_00  And they were like...
477.18 479.36 SPEAKER_00  You're upselling a child on monster?
479.54 480.22 SPEAKER_00  I was like, come on.
480.24 482.80 SPEAKER_05  You're like, nah, nah, boost is not going to cut it, my G.
482.92 484.96 SPEAKER_00  No, the margins in the monster are so much better.
484.96 485.90 SPEAKER_00  Please buy that.
486.32 487.46 SPEAKER_00  Like, you know, please do it.
487.58 488.34 SPEAKER_00  And they didn't do it.
488.52 489.32 SPEAKER_00  And so...
489.32 489.68 SPEAKER_00  Are you...
489.68 490.34 SPEAKER_00  Are you...
490.42 492.16 SPEAKER_00  I once again lost the debate to a child.
492.70 497.14 SPEAKER_05  But you had the last laugh because you swapped that out for a savoury vape at the last minute.
497.76 501.66 SPEAKER_05  He thought he was getting blue razz and then, boom, a hit of roast chicken.
502.54 505.20 SPEAKER_01  You'd hate a savoury energy drink.
505.44 507.86 SPEAKER_02  Just like the red wine flavoured Red Bull.
508.12 511.74 SPEAKER_02  Are you saying that you are a kind of energy drink sommelier?
511.74 511.94 SPEAKER_02  Yay.
512.82 513.30 SPEAKER_00  I did.
513.30 513.48 SPEAKER_00  I love that.
513.48 516.18 SPEAKER_00  I feel like I did try that as a bit a long time ago.
516.30 517.40 SPEAKER_00  And you didn't quite, like...
517.40 517.76 SPEAKER_00  I didn't...
517.76 518.46 SPEAKER_00  It didn't quite hit.
518.52 519.12 SPEAKER_00  But I bought...
519.12 525.86 SPEAKER_00  I did buy, like, a wine glass somewhere for the purpose of when I was bored during lockdown, doing the monster energy sommelier thing.
525.86 528.82 SPEAKER_02  But to bring it back around, right?
528.82 531.68 SPEAKER_02  We mentioned earlier that, like, they're not doing their...
531.68 534.40 SPEAKER_02  Any of the green investment, any of the industrial strategy, right?
534.40 534.54 SPEAKER_00  No.
534.54 541.24 SPEAKER_02  The strategy for governing Britain is not even the one that was a giveaway to industry that industry wanted.
541.56 548.16 SPEAKER_02  Because that's adapting to the climate crisis in the way that capital wants to adapt, which is, hey, here's some investment.
548.26 549.72 SPEAKER_02  It's been completely de-risked.
549.98 550.38 SPEAKER_02  Congratulations.
550.78 551.42 SPEAKER_02  You go build it.
551.48 551.58 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
551.88 556.74 SPEAKER_01  Literally, the Inflation Recovery Act of, like, here is infinite free money...
556.74 557.08 SPEAKER_01  Yes.
557.44 559.22 SPEAKER_01  ...to go and, like, do solar panels.
559.34 561.52 SPEAKER_01  Please do solar panels and grift it for all your worth.
561.72 563.98 SPEAKER_05  Sends the caffeinated children into the mines.
564.04 564.78 SPEAKER_05  That's what I say.
564.78 569.72 SPEAKER_01  The thing is, and I identify with Keir Starmer a little bit here, because he's too submissive for his own good, right?
569.72 574.26 SPEAKER_01  He's given them everything that they want, and they're like, yeah, this is perfect.
574.66 575.14 SPEAKER_01  Cheers.
575.32 576.82 SPEAKER_01  Wait until the next election.
577.24 586.58 SPEAKER_01  And that wait is driving him insane, and so he is just offering more and more things that no one wants or needs, because he's like, please, you know?
587.60 592.32 SPEAKER_01  It's important that you are entirely on side with me, so I'll give you anything.
592.60 593.48 SPEAKER_01  Absolutely anything.
593.48 602.36 SPEAKER_05  It's that interrogation strategy where you just don't say anything, and you just let Keir Starmer monologue until he's like, shall we abolish the Navy?
603.60 604.76 SPEAKER_05  I'm open to it.
605.62 606.10 SPEAKER_05  Okay.
606.28 616.30 SPEAKER_05  What if all of the energy drinks were given to the Navy in order to reduce their staff by 50% in order to fund a tax cut on capital gains?
616.40 617.00 SPEAKER_05  How about that?
617.70 619.06 SPEAKER_05  They're just still not saying anything.
619.22 620.84 SPEAKER_05  He's like, he's talking to a rubber doll.
621.72 622.52 SPEAKER_01  One ship left.
622.58 623.72 SPEAKER_01  HMS Relentless.
624.12 624.86 SPEAKER_02  That's right.
624.86 625.14 SPEAKER_02  Hey.
625.14 628.08 SPEAKER_05  But if you want to- HMS Monster, which is a tugboat.
628.08 649.38 SPEAKER_02  If you want to talk, though, about a perfect example of the absolute decrepitude of the governance of this country, the disease that has taken hold of the governing class, you must look no further than the charts describing the price action of ARM, which was like Britain's only important tech company in any sense of the word.
649.38 651.10 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, who are they? What do they make?
651.20 653.60 SPEAKER_02  So ARM is a microchip designer.
653.88 655.96 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, they make microprocessors, right?
656.14 656.36 SPEAKER_02  Okay.
656.50 661.40 SPEAKER_02  But they design microprocessors and work with everybody else who makes them.
661.58 661.78 SPEAKER_02  Okay.
661.78 663.66 SPEAKER_02  It's an incredibly important company.
663.78 671.12 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, it's sort of like- Okay, so they're a British company, which exists because the University of Cambridge spun off a tech thing.
671.26 673.42 SPEAKER_01  That's part of what the University of Cambridge still exists for, right?
673.42 679.22 SPEAKER_01  It's to create companies like this as like a- I guess you could fashionably call it a tech incubator, right?
679.50 679.86 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
680.12 683.10 SPEAKER_01  And long-suffering stand-up comedian podcasters.
683.22 683.82 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, exactly.
683.84 685.52 SPEAKER_07  The two things that Cambridge makes them.
685.52 692.84 SPEAKER_01  But so, yeah, they had this company, ARM, that is tremendously valuable, tremendously strategically important.
692.84 709.00 SPEAKER_01  And what any government that was interested in governing should have done many years ago was park a tank division on their front lawn and go into the head office and say, if you try and move any of this shit out of the UK, we'll fucking kill you.
709.58 716.56 SPEAKER_01  That's like, legitimately, that kind of protectionism is the only valid method of governing here.
716.56 719.06 SPEAKER_01  And what they've done instead is not do that.
719.20 721.72 SPEAKER_01  And surprise, surprise, a bunch of it is being offshored.
721.92 727.90 SPEAKER_01  And like, this has been in the offing for years that ARM cannot wait to get out of the UK and into the US.
728.16 730.02 SPEAKER_01  So, specifically what happened, right?
730.04 737.96 SPEAKER_02  And by the way, that thing of parking tanks on the lawn and saying, you will not move the technology out of this geographical area is what the US did.
738.12 738.78 SPEAKER_02  And again- Yes.
739.20 743.14 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, you have a shitload of stuff like the Defense Production Act that you can use to do this.
743.46 744.86 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, it worked for their purposes.
744.86 752.56 SPEAKER_02  Now, what happened in 2016 is that after the Brexit vote pushed down the- I'm sorry, I'm going to put on my Steve Bray top hat here.
752.98 753.46 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
753.48 764.18 SPEAKER_02  After the Brexit vote pushed down the value of sterling, Masayoshi Son walked into ARM and said, hey, I see that you're now selling at a discount because of sterling.
764.48 768.54 SPEAKER_02  I'm going to take out a bunch of loans to buy you and put you in our Saudi investment vehicle.
768.90 772.66 SPEAKER_02  And then it was just allowed to go ahead, right?
772.66 777.36 SPEAKER_02  It was allowed to go ahead by Philip Hammond and Theresa May to make Brexit look good.
777.76 777.86 SPEAKER_02  Cool.
778.00 779.30 SPEAKER_07  How does this make Brexit look good?
779.70 781.74 SPEAKER_02  Because people wanted to invest in a British company.
781.86 784.48 SPEAKER_07  So, you're telling me that ARM is based on Newcastle United?
785.34 789.42 SPEAKER_07  We sold it to the Saudis and now everyone makes fun of them and just chants at them.
790.24 792.58 SPEAKER_05  It's actually owned half by Sports Direct.
792.58 808.90 SPEAKER_01  I mean, what it sort of is, is like, if in the early years of the Industrial Revolution, we had taken the first steam engine made in Britain and dumped it on cinder blocks outside the factory and gone, does anyone want to buy this and take it out of the country?
808.98 810.34 SPEAKER_01  Because I'm sick of looking at it.
811.08 814.62 SPEAKER_02  It's as though we sold the first steam engine to the Meiji Emperor.
814.62 821.40 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, if you're listening at home and you want an easy to understand metaphor, it's as if we sold the first steam engine to the Meiji Emperor.
821.58 824.40 SPEAKER_01  There's a mecca with Anthony Warhol Thompson inside in there.
824.60 825.92 SPEAKER_07  Keir Starmer's got some figs.
826.28 828.66 SPEAKER_01  It's a lot like if Suleiman the Magnificent, right?
828.98 837.26 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, so the reason that we bring this all this up at the same time is, if you are to have, it's not again, it's not saying AI is great, right?
837.32 837.78 SPEAKER_02  None of that.
837.78 856.38 SPEAKER_02  But if you are to have an industrial strategy, if you do believe that it's important to have like AI capabilities and stuff and have lots of data centers and be able to at least, if not to fabricate, then at least design chips and be important in the global economy, then keeping that company in the country would be super important.
856.72 856.84 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
857.12 861.92 SPEAKER_02  Just as, for example, would be building wind turbines, adapting to the climate crisis.
861.92 874.18 SPEAKER_01  I have a second piece of kind of like national security thing here, which is that this is going to segue into or tie into a later segment, but I will point out that ARM as like an architecture was co-designed by a trans woman.
874.44 880.44 SPEAKER_01  So if you want Britain to be a sort of competitive economy in the 21st century, two things.
880.72 883.66 SPEAKER_01  One, you have to stop technology companies from offshoring.
884.04 887.46 SPEAKER_01  And two, you have to be fucking nicer to trans women.
887.70 892.74 SPEAKER_07  This is what I'm fucking saying about Kim Patris, because like we are so obsessed in this country with like-
892.74 893.64 SPEAKER_01  Can we cut her mic? Yeah.
894.32 897.14 SPEAKER_07  We're so obsessed in this country with like trying to stop children transitioning.
897.58 900.44 SPEAKER_07  And it's like, Kim Patris was a child of transition.
900.44 902.20 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, we're falling behind in the transition race.
902.38 903.38 SPEAKER_07  We are! We literally are!
903.50 906.44 SPEAKER_01  China's trans kids are fucking mogging our trans kids.
906.68 907.46 SPEAKER_07  They literally are!
907.56 911.70 SPEAKER_07  Like Germany is decades ahead of us on like, she's like a massive trans pop star.
911.84 914.10 SPEAKER_07  Look at the Americans who are like producing people like Hunter Schaefer.
914.22 916.28 SPEAKER_07  Like we are falling fucking behind.
916.62 920.86 SPEAKER_01  Britain can only produce such rudimentary transsexuals as November Kelly and Abigail Thorne.
920.86 927.12 SPEAKER_07  And me! Like what have we got? It's you and me and Paris Lees and Yasmin.
927.82 931.48 SPEAKER_05  It's like the Sten gun in World War II. Like, you know, it was functional.
931.56 935.06 SPEAKER_07  We're still doing cavalry charges and they're fucking building the A-bomb.
935.06 937.82 SPEAKER_07  Like, I'm sort of, I quite like this. I'm sort of proud of this.
937.82 941.04 SPEAKER_04  Our boys have only got access to trans women that are just a couple of pipes welded together.
941.52 942.92 SPEAKER_04  But they're still fighting, Jerry.
943.06 943.18 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
943.32 950.86 SPEAKER_01  The closest thing I have to patriotism is that my gender is effectively two steel pipes welded together in a dying country.
951.52 953.10 SPEAKER_01  That still somehow works.
953.24 953.60 SPEAKER_01  You know?
953.60 955.42 SPEAKER_07  You're the Spitfire of trans women.
955.42 958.14 SPEAKER_01  That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said about me. Thank you.
958.72 959.38 SPEAKER_01  That's all right.
959.64 961.30 SPEAKER_07  Change your name to Spitfire, is it you?
961.58 962.22 SPEAKER_01  Sure, maybe.
962.30 963.88 SPEAKER_07  No, not again. I just got used to the new one.
964.78 967.40 SPEAKER_02  So let's flip the order around a little bit, actually.
967.56 977.40 SPEAKER_02  Rather than talking about the ongoing, I'd say, Labour Party falling apart because it has received a homeopathic amount.
978.06 978.96 SPEAKER_02  Of its own medicine.
979.12 979.50 SPEAKER_02  Yes.
979.50 979.94 SPEAKER_02  Indeed.
980.24 984.50 SPEAKER_02  I want to skip directly to our core topic, which is...
985.08 987.12 SPEAKER_02  Fucking be nicer to trans women.
987.42 988.18 SPEAKER_02  Indeed, yeah.
988.38 1002.94 SPEAKER_02  I've picked three stories, I think, that are, again, will spark some interesting conversation here, which is just stuff that's happened in the last week or so about just the viciously, vicious campaign against being regular.
1003.12 1003.28 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1003.40 1005.30 SPEAKER_02  Being waged by transphobes.
1005.30 1014.34 SPEAKER_07  It's back to business as usual. We had, like, I think less than 24 hours of people being like, maybe transphobia is bad, actually. And then we were just like, nah.
1015.46 1018.78 SPEAKER_01  Well, we had the, like, dead kids bad, make us feel upset.
1019.14 1024.46 SPEAKER_01  That immediately got diverted, in ways I've previously talked about, into we have to ban kids from being on their phones.
1024.64 1024.82 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1024.88 1028.02 SPEAKER_01  And so now we're, as you say, back to business as usual.
1028.02 1031.08 SPEAKER_07  The next day we had, well, should we just ban them from sports?
1031.08 1038.78 SPEAKER_07  And then now the NHS are doing another fucking consultation that's just like, should we allow trans children to exist or should we fire them out of a sort of cannon?
1039.84 1041.00 SPEAKER_05  At the Germans.
1042.68 1046.62 SPEAKER_02  Well, so, the, but they have V2 trans women.
1047.24 1054.58 SPEAKER_01  Well, see, the German dependence on, like, individually impressive but hard to maintain trans women is ultimately going to be their undoing.
1054.88 1055.18 SPEAKER_01  You know?
1055.18 1057.18 SPEAKER_01  It was all just cheap Russian gas.
1058.12 1061.44 SPEAKER_05  These German neo-pussies seized up in the cold of Stalingrad.
1062.44 1067.16 SPEAKER_05  Whereas the poorly engineered Russian pussy continued to function due to its high tolerance.
1067.32 1068.18 SPEAKER_01  Exactly, exactly.
1068.30 1075.04 SPEAKER_01  The German neo-vagina has a lot of, like, finicky, not user-replaceable parts that are going to break down in quite a long supply chain.
1075.28 1078.62 SPEAKER_01  Whereas the Soviet neo-vagina doesn't matter that it's cheap.
1078.66 1080.06 SPEAKER_01  It comes out of the factory unpainted.
1080.16 1082.80 SPEAKER_01  There's two million more of them in Siberia moving west.
1082.80 1088.92 SPEAKER_07  To be fair, like, some of the NHS neo-vaginas that I've encountered are fucking phenomenal.
1089.30 1091.30 SPEAKER_01  Oh, I've seen, I've seen the binder.
1091.82 1092.88 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, they'll nearly kill you.
1092.88 1095.14 SPEAKER_05  Alexander Kontashnikov presents his new invention.
1095.16 1100.02 SPEAKER_07  You might well be killed at the operation, but I've seen some that are fucking, you wouldn't believe it.
1100.14 1102.20 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, it would be nice if they let me have one one of these days.
1102.20 1103.92 SPEAKER_01  I've seen places you people wouldn't believe.
1104.18 1106.36 SPEAKER_01  Literally a thing that can be true, yes.
1106.36 1107.04 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1107.12 1119.68 SPEAKER_02  Like, so, um, what, one of the, one of the, uh, uh, sort of items that we're discussing is actually a, a row, a complete, again, invented controversy.
1120.50 1123.80 SPEAKER_02  All of these, by the way, two of these three things are invented controversies.
1123.86 1125.36 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, we still invent things in this country.
1126.14 1126.54 SPEAKER_02  Controversies.
1126.60 1127.12 SPEAKER_02  There are others.
1127.12 1129.00 SPEAKER_02  We no longer design.
1129.10 1129.68 SPEAKER_02  The trunky.
1129.84 1136.74 SPEAKER_02  We no longer design sort of the single most important commodity for what most people believe will be the global economy going forward.
1136.74 1139.78 SPEAKER_02  But we do stir up a lot of controversy and pay call them.
1139.80 1141.26 SPEAKER_07  We don't even design controversies.
1141.36 1142.76 SPEAKER_07  We import most of them from the US.
1144.12 1144.56 SPEAKER_02  Terrible.
1144.66 1147.20 SPEAKER_02  They closed down the controversy factory in Port Albert.
1147.58 1148.94 SPEAKER_02  This is this lend-lease, you know?
1149.28 1158.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, so the, um, basically the, uh, there was a proposal, uh, put forth in Parliament, um, for people to be able to be not misgendered on death.
1159.48 1168.74 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, this is, so, basically, right, of the two documents that the state has in relation to, the two most important ones are birth certificate and death certificate, right?
1168.98 1179.58 SPEAKER_01  And so, if you don't get a gender recognition certificate to amend your birth certificate, your death certificate will match the sex, it says, on your birth certificate, right?
1179.64 1182.20 SPEAKER_01  And this is a focus of particular cruelty, right?
1182.20 1194.02 SPEAKER_01  Because whenever a trans person dies, if they don't have a gender recognition certificate, which very few of us do, because they're a pain in the arse to get, then the state is sort of, like, legally obliged to misgender you.
1194.10 1195.82 SPEAKER_07  Let's mention why it's a pain in the arse to get.
1195.94 1197.50 SPEAKER_07  Firstly, it's, uh, expensive.
1197.92 1199.00 SPEAKER_07  Secondly, it's humiliating.
1199.36 1206.44 SPEAKER_07  Thirdly, you have to submit one piece of evidence from every two months that you have lived in what they call your acquired gender.
1206.44 1208.00 SPEAKER_07  They all have to be different.
1208.28 1212.86 SPEAKER_07  They all have to have your name, address, and a gender title like Ms. or Mr. on.
1213.20 1215.44 SPEAKER_07  So, just, listen, imagine if you've been living...
1215.44 1216.16 SPEAKER_01  Oh, another one.
1216.28 1219.08 SPEAKER_01  You have to get your spouse's permission or get divorced.
1219.24 1219.40 SPEAKER_07  Yes.
1219.72 1226.04 SPEAKER_07  So, listeners, imagine if I asked you to submit one piece of evidence from every two months of the last period of your life for, like, I don't know, ten years.
1226.16 1228.26 SPEAKER_07  It's a fucking impossible administrative task.
1228.26 1228.94 SPEAKER_02  Mm-hmm.
1229.28 1235.16 SPEAKER_02  And this, in this case, right, the response to this quite reasonable...
1235.16 1240.02 SPEAKER_02  Oh, yeah, this reasonable bare minimum of, hey, maybe we should just...
1240.02 1243.42 SPEAKER_02  At least let's allow dead people to self-identify, basically.
1243.98 1246.28 SPEAKER_02  They're like, no, it's too dangerous.
1247.00 1250.58 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, self-identification by the back door is the objection to this, right?
1250.74 1250.94 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, which...
1250.94 1256.32 SPEAKER_05  What if the dead start identifying as the living and then we'll be in some kind of Shaun of the Dead situation?
1256.32 1264.44 SPEAKER_01  And this is the thing, like, so many of the objections to self-ID just melt into the ether when you're applying them to dead people, right?
1264.48 1270.32 SPEAKER_01  Because you can't be like, what if someone uses this falsely if what they're using it to do falsely is decompose?
1271.52 1277.40 SPEAKER_07  But also, no, even then, I think that's being slightly too generous to them, because they also melt into nothingness when you apply them to living people.
1277.72 1285.24 SPEAKER_07  The objection has always been like, what if you could, like, self-ID and then enter a women's bathroom, which is completely defeated by the fact that you don't need to show your birth certificate to enter a fucking toilet, right?
1285.24 1286.20 SPEAKER_07  Wait, what?
1286.64 1287.10 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, I know.
1287.38 1288.84 SPEAKER_07  You've just been showing it every time.
1288.86 1290.80 SPEAKER_07  I've been carrying it around for no reason.
1291.14 1296.94 SPEAKER_07  So, like, I think this is what Innuendo Studios' Ian Danskin would call trying to control the conversation, like, what they want.
1297.04 1303.74 SPEAKER_07  So there's a quote here from Lucy Marsh, who's the spokesperson from the Society for Making Life Worse, or whatever it's called.
1303.86 1304.96 SPEAKER_07  Some right-wing think tank.
1305.06 1309.84 SPEAKER_07  She says, It's extremely concerning that Labour appears to be pushing towards introducing gender self-ID through the back door.
1309.84 1317.40 SPEAKER_07  If coroners are allowed to lie on public record about the sex of deceased children, this will surely be a slippery slope towards self-ID becoming normalised in the NHS, right?
1317.40 1321.26 SPEAKER_01  Getting more and more perverse wanting to know the sex of deceased children.
1321.26 1321.88 SPEAKER_01  It is.
1321.88 1327.60 SPEAKER_07  But they want us to get tied up in these conversations about who can change the legal documents and when and what the documents allow you to do.
1328.08 1335.92 SPEAKER_07  While the core lie that transphobia rallies around remains intact, which is that they maintain that human beings cannot change sex.
1335.92 1339.76 SPEAKER_07  And, like, my response to this is just an absolute, like, Chad meme, yes we can.
1339.94 1341.14 SPEAKER_07  Like, you can change sex.
1341.34 1341.86 SPEAKER_07  It's easy.
1342.12 1345.04 SPEAKER_07  It's fun to do if other people will fucking get over themselves and let you.
1345.28 1347.70 SPEAKER_07  And legal documents need to fucking reflect that reality.
1348.28 1350.48 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, I mean, this is the thing, right?
1350.76 1353.42 SPEAKER_01  It's not a difficult administrative thing to do.
1353.52 1359.08 SPEAKER_01  What it is for transphobic people and institutions is a conceptually difficult thing to do, right?
1359.08 1363.76 SPEAKER_01  It is not difficult to make a field editable, right?
1363.76 1369.18 SPEAKER_01  But it is difficult to, like, think of that specific field in order to make that change, right?
1369.50 1370.82 SPEAKER_01  And, yeah, absolutely.
1371.44 1381.84 SPEAKER_02  And so the responses from various, like, MPs and campaigning groups have been saying, as you've been saying, Abby, it's like, oh, this will allow people to self-ID through the back door.
1382.02 1383.82 SPEAKER_02  Let's see, wait, the back mortuary door?
1383.88 1388.06 SPEAKER_02  Are they concerned about, like, a Night of the Living Dead situation where they don't respect changing rooms?
1388.06 1394.76 SPEAKER_02  Or, but also, again, the idea that, no, we must never bend truth to accommodate the extreme and dangerous ideology.
1395.12 1398.62 SPEAKER_02  And that will allow us to misrecord the sex of dead children.
1399.18 1410.44 SPEAKER_02  And what I always, what I enjoyed, this whole sort of segue into the next sort of news item that we talked about, which was, of course, the one that was also had a, I think, a very sort of good article in The Guardian written about it by Jonathan Liu.
1410.44 1413.76 SPEAKER_02  Because I imagine the sports section didn't get the same memo the op-ed section did.
1414.32 1415.02 SPEAKER_02  Legitimately, yes.
1415.08 1419.22 SPEAKER_01  It's just not, it's fully not being accountable to the same couple of people.
1419.56 1419.78 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1420.74 1444.78 SPEAKER_02  That basically, hey, how come this, again, the policy exchange seems to have declared, I don't know, kind of war, sort of, on Park Run, which, if you're not British, is an event that's been happening in Britain for a while, where it's just a group of people running around a park where you don't, there's no winners, they record a finishing time if you want, and you can do it on a...
1444.78 1445.80 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, on like an iPhone.
1446.20 1449.36 SPEAKER_01  Like, it's not rigorous in any sort of way.
1449.44 1450.68 SPEAKER_01  It's meant to be a bit of fun.
1450.76 1452.82 SPEAKER_01  It's, like, extremely casual.
1452.92 1475.08 SPEAKER_01  And again, like, I have a similar objection to Abby's about death certificates, right, about this, which is that I don't want to concede the idea that, like, the value of records in professional sport is something that can be threatened by the existence of, like, trans people competing as our gender in the thing.
1475.46 1481.02 SPEAKER_01  But this is still a case where it doesn't matter anyway, because it's nothing like that.
1481.26 1483.26 SPEAKER_01  It is purely casual.
1483.42 1485.36 SPEAKER_01  There is no reason to be rigorous about this.
1485.36 1495.22 SPEAKER_01  There is no possible way you can expect a loose organisation of park runners to try and, like, be sequencing people's fucking genomes or whatever the fuck, like the IOC.
1495.78 1496.86 SPEAKER_01  It's just...
1496.86 1510.48 SPEAKER_01  What it is, is it's an attack on, like, human dignity of trans people in a way that is completely impractical and intended to, like, scare, you know, some quite nice people who like to run in the park into line.
1510.48 1515.30 SPEAKER_07  Also, the threat is that government funding from Sport England would be withdrawn, right?
1515.36 1515.56 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
1515.56 1516.24 SPEAKER_07  I understood that correctly.
1516.64 1532.44 SPEAKER_07  Is that if, oh, this right-wing think tank, like, the exchange of absolute batshit nonsense institution, have been like, oh, if you don't start sequencing everyone's genome and recording a faulty understanding of what biological sex is to reflect our mad fantasies about it, then we'll withdraw your taxpayers' money.
1532.54 1533.30 SPEAKER_07  And it's just like...
1533.30 1539.60 SPEAKER_07  But I really loved it, though, that the news went down to interview the people who do park run, and they were all just like, no, actually, I think it's fine.
1539.94 1540.58 SPEAKER_07  It's just a bit of fun.
1540.58 1542.86 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, it's a bit of fun.
1542.96 1546.64 SPEAKER_01  I think it's nice that sport's more inclusive, things of this nature.
1546.72 1566.20 SPEAKER_01  Like, you actually ask people about this, and particularly you ask them about this on the level of a sport that they can and do actually participate in themselves, rather than some, like, elite sort of athletics thing where people's instinct is maybe, oh, people work really hard on that, so, you know, it's important to preserve the imagined sanctity of it.
1566.20 1571.46 SPEAKER_01  In this case, it's fully just like, no, it's a bit of fun, therefore, why are you asking me about this?
1572.42 1577.14 SPEAKER_05  Wait until you hear about their plan to let trans women participate in tossing the pill about with Chugsy.
1578.14 1579.86 SPEAKER_06  That's really going to attract some controversy.
1580.20 1587.16 SPEAKER_01  I mean, it's that, and then trans men are getting the rights to participate in getting shirtless and hitting each other over the back with chairs.
1587.16 1591.76 SPEAKER_01  Which is going to be a huge moment for them, you know, I'm very happy for them.
1591.76 1616.48 SPEAKER_02  And this comes back to, I think, whenever these sort of media and political obsessions that make perfect sense between columnists and MPs when they talk to one another actually break containment and reach the world of people with actual concerns doing actual things, again and again, they are met with, at best, confusion.
1617.04 1618.00 SPEAKER_02  Which I find quite hard.
1618.00 1627.18 SPEAKER_01  One of the best determinants of whether or not someone holds transphobic attitudes is whether they say that they know a trans person, right?
1627.50 1637.48 SPEAKER_01  Like, having actual exposure to trans people makes you aware of the fact that we aren't, in fact, sort of acid blood-having monsters.
1638.72 1639.26 SPEAKER_01  Some of us are.
1639.26 1647.46 SPEAKER_01  Well, yeah, of course, naturally, but, like, in general, I, for one, am two bits of steel welded together in, like, a shed in wooden basset.
1647.72 1647.94 SPEAKER_01  But no.
1648.12 1648.80 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1649.04 1650.02 SPEAKER_01  Dads love her.
1650.40 1651.18 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, exactly.
1651.64 1664.30 SPEAKER_01  But, so, yeah, it's, I think it's this thing where this kind of transphobia flourishes in isolation and, like, radicalization and watching GV News or being on the fucking internet all the time.
1664.30 1671.14 SPEAKER_01  And those are things that do not correlate very well with going out and, like, having a run in the park.
1671.36 1672.44 SPEAKER_02  Literally touching grass.
1672.46 1672.48 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1672.48 1681.60 SPEAKER_01  Legitimately, what they've done is they've gone to the, like, All England Touching Grass Association and gone, hey, have you seen our weird online beefs?
1681.68 1683.54 SPEAKER_01  You have to get in on these or else.
1683.54 1695.68 SPEAKER_05  Park Run is, like, the perfect lab brat for this because it is, like, the most, like, head-empty, pure vibes, people who have been on 10,000 hinge dates and think junkyard golf is awesome level of people who aren't online.
1696.62 1706.60 SPEAKER_01  Because fucking Shazza and Dino, right, who live for curry night at Weatherspoons, are not habitually driving themselves insane on the internet about trans women.
1706.74 1710.16 SPEAKER_05  You ask Dino what he thinks about trans women and he'll go, some of them are fit.
1710.16 1714.82 SPEAKER_05  And there endeth the lesson, you know?
1715.04 1716.16 SPEAKER_02  There's nothing more to it.
1716.20 1716.96 SPEAKER_07  And that's a king.
1717.88 1729.02 SPEAKER_02  And, you know, this is, if you go back to what the policy exchange is saying, they say it's important to do this because they have to say, they have to have a fig leaf justification other than just, it's important to do this because we're mental.
1729.02 1736.84 SPEAKER_02  Their fig leaf justification is, it's important to do this because women and girls are now self-excluding and our achievements are denied a public record.
1736.86 1741.98 SPEAKER_01  But, Doctor, I am women and girls and I self-exclude from shit constantly because of all of this mad bullshit.
1741.98 1755.88 SPEAKER_02  And also, if you're talking about cis women and girls, this is a time when, like, national legislators, if they see a, like, tall cis woman with a short haircut, will start a panic about her in the press.
1756.06 1756.86 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, absolutely.
1757.42 1759.28 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, Tilda Swinton, you're on fucking notice.
1759.28 1762.58 SPEAKER_02  Again, like, this happens.
1762.96 1763.64 SPEAKER_02  This happens.
1764.34 1779.08 SPEAKER_02  Where, like, I think it was Klein in the US, who's mentioned in the Guardian article, says, like, created a national panic because, like, she saw, like, a, just a tall cis woman going and, like, competing in a sport.
1779.46 1779.78 SPEAKER_01  Oh, yeah.
1779.82 1784.82 SPEAKER_01  I mean, this is insanely sadistic and, like, very racist, by the way.
1784.82 1790.64 SPEAKER_01  Like, particularly in, sort of, like, professional sport or, like, there's really, like, higher levels of sport.
1790.76 1802.96 SPEAKER_01  You saw, like, athletes, like, former Olympians talking amongst themselves, speculating about which, specifically black athletes, they thought had, like, elevated testosterone levels because they were secretly men.
1803.14 1807.86 SPEAKER_01  Like, Caster Semenya was, like, sort of patient zero of this, but, like, well, not even.
1807.98 1811.12 SPEAKER_01  Like, it goes back way before her, but it's absolutely repulsive.
1811.12 1818.98 SPEAKER_01  And it's so, so strange to see it sort of, like, out of, if you like, its element and now fully in the realm of fun runs.
1819.46 1821.40 SPEAKER_07  Well, it's already been in school sports as well.
1821.50 1828.42 SPEAKER_07  Like, there's dads in the US who've had to be removed from, like, school sports games because they just start yelling about how some nine-year-old on the opposite team is trans.
1828.90 1830.90 SPEAKER_07  And it's just like, sorry, you're mad.
1831.00 1831.56 SPEAKER_07  You're mad.
1831.90 1836.40 SPEAKER_02  Well, it is a kind of, like, a memetic disease.
1836.88 1837.02 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1837.02 1840.46 SPEAKER_02  You know, you become unable to perceive the world of brain worms.
1840.66 1842.32 SPEAKER_02  The anti-woke mind virus.
1842.78 1848.94 SPEAKER_02  And the third item is, I think, my favorite one of the three.
1849.40 1849.72 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
1850.52 1853.94 SPEAKER_01  This is, in some ways, the most depressing because it's the most mental.
1854.32 1854.46 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1854.50 1859.66 SPEAKER_02  Well, it's the most strain, right?
1859.66 1866.26 SPEAKER_02  It's the, it is, because this is, like, ultimately most transphobic arguments come down to something like this.
1866.38 1866.58 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1866.84 1874.90 SPEAKER_02  Which is, yeah, which is a, this is, this woman has been being threatened with a fine by her council, whereas the Daily Mail calls them council bureaucrats.
1875.30 1875.48 SPEAKER_06  Mm-hmm.
1875.48 1882.48 SPEAKER_02  Over, like, posting images of, like, top surgery to her front door, being like, I am making a point.
1882.50 1883.22 SPEAKER_07  Posting to your front door.
1883.80 1885.72 SPEAKER_02  Physically posting, like, in her window.
1885.88 1886.68 SPEAKER_07  Printing them out.
1886.90 1887.04 SPEAKER_07  Yes.
1887.04 1889.70 SPEAKER_07  Like, like, scars of, of top surgery and, like, breast removal.
1889.70 1891.72 SPEAKER_07  I'm posting this and not in a horny way.
1891.86 1892.04 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
1892.68 1892.90 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1893.12 1895.70 SPEAKER_01  But, why, though?
1896.22 1896.54 SPEAKER_01  Well.
1896.60 1898.66 SPEAKER_01  In God's name, why do this?
1899.58 1901.82 SPEAKER_02  Well, thank you for asking, November.
1901.82 1909.14 SPEAKER_02  Um, that's because, uh, she, well, she wasn't just as well, um, photographs of, uh, of surgery.
1909.62 1910.02 SPEAKER_02  Uh-huh.
1910.32 1914.18 SPEAKER_02  It was also an advert for, uh, a book by Helen Joyce.
1914.60 1915.64 SPEAKER_02  Of course.
1916.18 1917.14 SPEAKER_02  Irreversible damage.
1917.30 1917.40 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1917.40 1918.90 SPEAKER_07  No, sorry, that's, uh, Abigail Schreier.
1919.04 1920.94 SPEAKER_07  Uh, allow me to fill you in on who Helen Joyce is.
1921.22 1927.04 SPEAKER_07  Helen Joyce, former editor of The Economist, uh, caught on camera saying that we need to reduce the number of trans people who exist in the world.
1927.36 1931.10 SPEAKER_07  Every single one of these people is a problem for a sane society, I think is the exact quote.
1931.10 1931.82 SPEAKER_07  Oh, cool.
1931.82 1932.86 SPEAKER_07  Even the ones who are happily transitioned.
1933.26 1941.90 SPEAKER_07  Also, much of her book, uh, which is called Trans, where when ideology meets reality, uh, is actually lifted from anti-Semitic conspiracy theorist Jennifer Billick, uh, without attribution.
1942.08 1943.12 SPEAKER_07  Oh, you mentioned, yeah.
1943.22 1944.12 SPEAKER_07  Which made Jennifer Billick extremely upset.
1944.44 1945.32 SPEAKER_07  And, uh, Joyce has repeatedly.
1945.32 1946.60 SPEAKER_05  Oh, not plagiarizing your anti-Semitism.
1947.02 1951.72 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, uh, Joyce has repeatedly recommended that people go and read Billick's anti-Semitic screeds.
1952.12 1952.32 SPEAKER_06  Hmm.
1952.50 1952.74 SPEAKER_06  Cool.
1953.32 1959.74 SPEAKER_02  Uh, additionally, uh, she also posted an anonymous handwritten letter supporting her gender critical views.
1959.74 1962.14 SPEAKER_02  She says, see, everybody likes me.
1962.52 1962.84 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1963.20 1964.90 SPEAKER_07  I regret sending that now.
1966.10 1966.80 SPEAKER_01  I'm kidding.
1966.80 1970.98 SPEAKER_01  It's just, it's so strange and abnormal.
1970.98 1991.76 SPEAKER_01  And I think, time and again, whenever you get into what we are now sort of, like, obliged for impartiality reasons to call gender critical views, they are so much more in conflict with, if you like, a sane society than the weirdest, most, like, outré, insane trans person I've ever seen.
1991.76 1997.08 SPEAKER_01  Like, it's genuinely repulsive, alarming people, you know?
1997.32 2002.70 SPEAKER_07  Yeah, because she's sticking up pictures of, like, gore and medical photographs on, like, where the public can see them.
2002.78 2004.94 SPEAKER_07  And it's just like, what do you think's gonna happen?
2005.18 2005.94 SPEAKER_07  It's a medical procedure.
2005.94 2018.98 SPEAKER_01  It's like, it's like me posting a photo of, like, mid-hip replacement on my front door and being like, this is, you are irreversibly, like, lowering the number of healthy hip bones in the world.
2019.30 2022.48 SPEAKER_07  And also, statistically, you're more likely to regret that than top surgery.
2022.60 2023.90 SPEAKER_01  That's significantly so, yeah.
2023.90 2035.72 SPEAKER_02  Also, it's like posting a picture of a, sort of, as you say, a mid-hip surgery and then saying, anyway, now that we've all looked at some surgery, would you care to come inside and listen to my views?
2035.94 2038.26 SPEAKER_01  Or just walk past my front door?
2038.60 2048.04 SPEAKER_01  Like, would you like to have your experience of walking down my street enlivened by, like, seeing a bunch of, like, scalpel incisions just in your day?
2048.04 2053.64 SPEAKER_07  If I saw that pinned to somebody's front door, my first thought would be, like, oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Bloggs, like, someone's playing a nasty joke on you.
2054.06 2055.74 SPEAKER_07  They're trying to scare you by picking this up.
2056.52 2059.24 SPEAKER_07  Somebody's posted something horrible on your door, Mrs. Bloggs, are you okay?
2059.68 2065.20 SPEAKER_07  And then she's like, no, actually, it's the transgenders that are trying to take away all precious girls' fertility.
2065.48 2067.66 SPEAKER_07  And I'll be like, oh, I'm sorry, you're mad.
2068.26 2068.40 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2068.68 2071.26 SPEAKER_03  Don't fuck with a surgeon's mafia or we'll be back.
2072.04 2076.00 SPEAKER_03  We'll be posting pictures of appendectomies all over your front windows.
2076.00 2080.56 SPEAKER_01  Oh, you don't want to know what the gender surgeon's mafia leaves in your bed if you wrong them.
2081.88 2083.50 SPEAKER_01  A delightful German pussy.
2084.88 2086.32 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, but very finicky.
2087.18 2090.50 SPEAKER_02  But to bring all these three items together.
2090.68 2091.56 SPEAKER_07  A finely machined pussy.
2092.42 2093.20 SPEAKER_05  That's right, yeah.
2093.30 2094.28 SPEAKER_05  Very fine tolerances.
2094.40 2097.12 SPEAKER_05  That's what the Bergheim piss guy manufactures all day.
2098.18 2103.48 SPEAKER_01  No, he works in the factory that, like, creates the machines, that machines some of the parts in it.
2103.80 2104.74 SPEAKER_02  He does the tooling.
2104.74 2106.38 SPEAKER_02  Once again, didn't see him.
2106.78 2108.60 SPEAKER_02  I went last weekend, didn't see him.
2108.94 2112.28 SPEAKER_02  It was a hard week at the pussy machine tooling factory.
2112.86 2116.02 SPEAKER_07  So they didn't talk about it so much, but they did make pussy for the Nazis during the war.
2117.18 2118.70 SPEAKER_07  No time for piss this week.
2118.78 2122.70 SPEAKER_05  I'm too focused on machining the tooling for the urethra machine, ironically.
2122.70 2128.34 SPEAKER_05  I do see the cruel, cruel ironies.
2129.68 2131.40 SPEAKER_05  Not such a cruel irony, I suppose.
2131.40 2134.24 SPEAKER_05  Not as I'm into women's piss anyway, so I guess it's academic.
2134.24 2134.66 SPEAKER_01  Is he not?
2134.70 2136.82 SPEAKER_05  Is he genuinely sexist about piss?
2137.28 2138.18 SPEAKER_05  Well, he's in the men's toilet.
2138.18 2138.76 SPEAKER_01  Can he tell?
2139.00 2139.30 SPEAKER_01  Oh, yeah.
2139.66 2141.36 SPEAKER_01  Are the toilets of Bergheim even gendered?
2141.36 2142.84 SPEAKER_05  No, he's by the urinals.
2143.20 2144.70 SPEAKER_01  Anyone can use the urinals.
2145.18 2145.28 SPEAKER_01  Okay.
2145.78 2147.32 SPEAKER_05  But I guess it's typically men.
2147.38 2151.46 SPEAKER_01  I'm going to need to, like, go to Bergheim and do some, like, field research in this.
2151.56 2153.52 SPEAKER_01  You know, like, I'm here to do two things.
2153.58 2157.64 SPEAKER_01  I'm here to have, like, alarming lesbian sex in a sort of crowd of bewildered gay men.
2157.64 2161.90 SPEAKER_01  And I'm here to find out what the piss guy's deal is about female piss.
2162.24 2163.70 SPEAKER_01  Bringing in the field recorder.
2163.92 2165.28 SPEAKER_01  But then having it taped over.
2165.72 2166.08 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, yeah.
2166.10 2167.40 SPEAKER_07  Just doing a blind taste test.
2167.46 2168.36 SPEAKER_07  Can he tell the difference?
2168.74 2172.34 SPEAKER_01  Remember what I said about the weirdest trans women not being as weird as TERFs?
2173.82 2175.18 SPEAKER_07  Well, it's true, though.
2175.22 2178.20 SPEAKER_07  Yo, does my piss taste like an HIV?
2180.36 2182.06 SPEAKER_01  New thing to be insecure about.
2182.14 2183.12 SPEAKER_01  Getting piss dysphoid.
2183.66 2184.22 SPEAKER_01  Pissphoria!
2184.38 2184.82 SPEAKER_01  Fuck!
2185.08 2185.74 SPEAKER_02  Ah, yeah.
2186.74 2187.56 SPEAKER_02  Episode title.
2188.08 2191.84 SPEAKER_02  Anyway, but to bring all three of these different stories.
2191.94 2193.24 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, just from the last week.
2193.42 2194.36 SPEAKER_02  By the way, just from the last week.
2194.38 2194.66 SPEAKER_01  Oh, yeah.
2195.04 2195.74 SPEAKER_02  All together.
2195.88 2200.56 SPEAKER_01  Being trans in Britain is like, you wake up and some new shit like this has just dropped.
2200.86 2201.26 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2201.48 2205.54 SPEAKER_01  And you still have to go to work, you know, or do whatever the fuck you're going to do with your day.
2205.60 2208.42 SPEAKER_07  We all have a sanity meter and it's training fair.
2209.80 2211.82 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, you're losing D6 every day.
2212.54 2224.72 SPEAKER_02  But to bring it, I think, back all these things together, these three items, is in every case, these are people defending something that is increasingly, well, it's always very indefensible.
2224.72 2238.26 SPEAKER_02  And what is, as it gets pushed further and further and further, as it sort of steadfastly takes positions against like, for example, we have to guard against dead people invading like women's spaces.
2238.26 2245.98 SPEAKER_02  Or like, we have to make, we have to install a kind of penis detector on just like the bit of fun run through the park.
2246.78 2251.88 SPEAKER_02  The penis detector, the inflatable penis detector arch at the London Barrett.
2251.88 2257.82 SPEAKER_02  Or like, I am wallpapering my house in surgery photos and the council cannot stop me.
2258.12 2264.30 SPEAKER_02  In all cases, this is just a relentless commitment to being as weird and off-putting as possible.
2264.96 2265.02 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2265.10 2271.42 SPEAKER_01  And I think the thing is, like, I sort of, I go back and forth on the, like, be normal thing that we do sometimes, right?
2271.42 2276.88 SPEAKER_01  Because, like, I like abnormality and I think we should make room for more abnormality in public life.
2276.88 2279.70 SPEAKER_01  What I think it is, is cruelty, specifically, right?
2279.74 2290.06 SPEAKER_01  And I think the thing that people are responding to when someone from Sky News comes to their park and is like, do you think we should be, like, pulling down everybody's shorts to figure out what they've got going on under there?
2290.40 2296.12 SPEAKER_01  They're mostly experiencing that as a kind of strange, cruel thing to do, right?
2296.20 2300.88 SPEAKER_01  And I think most people want society to be kinder.
2301.72 2306.42 SPEAKER_01  And that is something that has been rigorously opposed by every political tendency in Britain.
2306.42 2324.22 SPEAKER_00  I was also going to ask, like, is this, and, you know, you would, like, know more about this than I would, but my sort of feeling from the outside is that the sort of weird behaviors that seem to emerge come out, it seems like they become weirder as they sort of realize that the political energy behind them is very much on their side.
2324.66 2344.12 SPEAKER_00  And so, like, in order to sort of, like, maintain, or in order to sort of maintain the fantasies that, like, trans people are this sort of existential danger, you know, you can sort of begin with, like, you know, the sort of, like, the sort of, you know, the bathroom bullshit is stuff that, like, pretty much every British political party has sort of taken on as being, like, you know, receptive to.
2344.22 2364.40 SPEAKER_00  And so in order to sort of maintain that movement of some kind, it has to become weirder and it has to become much more invasive, because how else are you going to sort of, like, present yourselves as being underdogs or being, like, the misheard or, you know, the sort of confluence with these sort of, like, anti-woke movements and their whole, you know, we are sort of the malign class and no one listens to us.
2364.44 2368.02 SPEAKER_00  Whereas, like, the government and the opposition parties do very much listen to you.
2368.06 2371.34 SPEAKER_00  In fact, if anything, they are too receptive to you.
2371.34 2373.72 SPEAKER_00  They don't refuse to meet with gender critical groups.
2374.16 2376.44 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, I think that's very perceptive.
2376.64 2384.30 SPEAKER_01  Like, and I think, like any radical group, there is always this drive, as you say, to be more extreme, to hype each other up and to get more attention.
2384.44 2387.94 SPEAKER_00  And it feels like this is sort of going to be, like, an interesting long-term trend to observe.
2388.08 2403.08 SPEAKER_00  Interesting also being, meaning horrific, to the degree that, like, it seems like the political parties kind of are receptive to the TERFs and everything on the basis, partly on the basis that, like, well, if you listen to them now, then, like, maybe, like, you can sort of quell their extremities.
2403.18 2404.34 SPEAKER_00  Like, you can sort of contain them.
2404.62 2408.52 SPEAKER_00  But, like, the reality is, like, no, like, when you listen to them, they become more extreme.
2408.74 2425.98 SPEAKER_00  Like, the whole, the nature of their movement is one that demands, like, you know, the one that sort of demands its followers to become more and more extreme to the point where, you know, even, like, there are sort of, I don't know, I don't know whether, like, there is, like, within TERF movements, there are people like, oh, guys, I don't know whether, like, we're sort of being a bit nuts on this one or...
2425.98 2426.64 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, this is the thing.
2426.76 2428.44 SPEAKER_01  This is, it happens sometimes.
2428.44 2432.48 SPEAKER_01  And what happens is that the movement very quickly, like, internally cauterizes those.
2433.42 2444.14 SPEAKER_01  And this is absolutely the thing about, like, radical, about radical groups like this, is that, like, if you do express doubt, you are, like, very, very quickly, like, forced back into line or forced out, right?
2444.20 2448.02 SPEAKER_01  And so you see this happen and you see people get de-radicalized this way.
2448.40 2460.34 SPEAKER_01  But just in general, in terms of the, like, kind of treadmill of things getting more radical, this is something that trans activists warned people about, including the people in both parties.
2460.64 2468.48 SPEAKER_01  Like, you hate to hand it to people, but there were trans people in the Conservative Party telling the Conservative Party that this was going to get out of control.
2468.90 2471.22 SPEAKER_01  And neither party listened.
2471.48 2473.08 SPEAKER_01  No one, more or less, listened.
2473.16 2474.36 SPEAKER_01  And this is the result.
2474.46 2475.36 SPEAKER_01  This is where we're at now.
2475.54 2478.10 SPEAKER_01  You know, it's going to be that much harder to eradicate.
2478.10 2495.74 SPEAKER_07  And it becomes more conspiratorial as well, because as, well, if they say they want to, like, debate and to examine the evidence and so on, but the more they realize the evidence simply does not support their positions, the more they have to say, oh, well, like, the reason every major healthcare body in the world internationally is now condemning NHS England is because they've been infiltrated by trans activists.
2496.18 2503.14 SPEAKER_07  And, like, the reason that, you know, every think tank who, like, knows what the fuck they're talking about says that we're mental is because, you know, they're secretly woke or whatever.
2503.50 2505.54 SPEAKER_02  Well, Stonewall, they've all been taken over by Stonewall.
2505.54 2506.60 SPEAKER_07  They've all been taken over by Stonewall.
2506.60 2508.98 SPEAKER_07  And, like, they're being funded by Jewish billionaires.
2509.08 2510.18 SPEAKER_07  It's not that people disagree with us.
2510.26 2512.48 SPEAKER_07  It's like, you know, our opposition is secretly being bought.
2512.76 2524.44 SPEAKER_07  And eventually you arrive in a place where you're just, like, saying the shit, like, the UN is Hamas, because, like, you've reached that same sort of point where it's like, everyone can see you're full of shit, but you have to, like, double down and say it's some kind of fucking conspiracy.
2525.10 2527.88 SPEAKER_02  I'll use that, in fact, to transition to our next segment.
2528.92 2529.50 SPEAKER_02  Thank you.
2529.58 2531.54 SPEAKER_02  Which is something I did, I wanted to put first.
2531.54 2533.32 SPEAKER_02  A process that could take a few years.
2533.32 2533.36 SPEAKER_01  Yes.
2533.88 2539.92 SPEAKER_02  Well, which is, of course, before we do a quick, we'll see if we have time for a quick article at the end.
2540.14 2558.60 SPEAKER_02  But I think it's worth talking about something I alluded to earlier, which is that the moment Keir Starmer receives, I would say, a modicum of any media coverage less than fawning, then he completely falls apart and starts looking very weak and feckless.
2558.60 2567.66 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, I mean, this is another example of things that people told the Labour Party would happen and things that the Labour Party did not listen about.
2568.12 2584.78 SPEAKER_02  So what has happened is there are a number of by-elections for, again, you listening in the States or outside of the UK, where Labour candidates had been secretly recorded at what was very, very strongly referred to as a community cohesion meeting last October.
2584.78 2592.68 SPEAKER_02  Or again, recorded those recordings given to the right-wing press and then just allowed to be released like months later.
2593.26 2599.60 SPEAKER_01  Going through to like increasingly mask off Islamophobe and anti-Semite Guido Fawkes.
2599.94 2600.10 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2600.56 2604.38 SPEAKER_01  Who essentially were people at this meeting.
2604.66 2614.78 SPEAKER_01  If he wants to sue us on either of those, I have seen the tweets he posted and then deleted where he said that Labour was trading unsophisticated Muslim votes for sophisticated Jewish ones.
2615.28 2620.72 SPEAKER_02  At this meeting were multiple prospective parliamentary candidates, including two, one called Azhar Ali and one called Graham Jones.
2621.22 2626.98 SPEAKER_02  And this was all happening while like mass resignations were occurring in the party regarding the stance on Gaza and so on.
2627.32 2632.08 SPEAKER_02  What first came out was Ali, a candidate in the by-election in Rochdale.
2632.64 2640.04 SPEAKER_02  It basically said that it was recorded saying Israel in a quite literal sense, like wanted the events of October 7th to happen so they could have a free hand in Gaza.
2640.46 2650.60 SPEAKER_02  And my understanding is that this wasn't meant in the kind of like Hamas is beneficial to Netanyahu politically kind of way, but more like the stupid Facebook post conspiracy theory kind of way.
2650.78 2650.98 SPEAKER_02  Yes.
2651.12 2651.24 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2651.32 2652.42 SPEAKER_02  Like false flag shit, right?
2652.52 2653.24 SPEAKER_02  That's what he was alleging.
2653.24 2668.16 SPEAKER_02  And then this other guy, Graham Jones, was then a recording of him came out the next day, again, all via Guido Fox, just being frustrated with Israel, which in the States is being something Biden claims to be every day.
2668.86 2669.02 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2669.24 2670.76 SPEAKER_01  Calling Netanyahu an asshole.
2671.16 2671.28 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2671.28 2674.22 SPEAKER_01  In this case, he said fucking Israel, I think.
2674.58 2674.78 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2675.12 2675.72 SPEAKER_01  That's it.
2676.18 2676.36 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2676.68 2686.34 SPEAKER_02  And then he also said that he also said that people, that Britons who go fight in the IDF should be locked up, which is, I believe, kind of the law, but kind of not based on some
2686.34 2686.86 SPEAKER_01  like loopholes.
2687.12 2696.94 SPEAKER_02  It's not, but largely because we want it not to be. Any case, and what I think is very instructive is that both of these guys are on the right of the party.
2697.56 2697.64 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2697.74 2697.96 SPEAKER_02  Right.
2698.34 2699.64 SPEAKER_02  Graham Jones, especially.
2699.84 2701.60 SPEAKER_02  I mean, Graham Jones is an interesting character.
2701.74 2708.18 SPEAKER_02  He's, he has, let's say, very pro the Saudi bombing campaign.
2708.26 2711.30 SPEAKER_02  He's the one guy who was like pro the Saudi bombing campaign in Yemen.
2711.64 2711.80 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2711.94 2713.78 SPEAKER_02  The member for Riyadh Central.
2714.00 2714.14 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2714.26 2714.42 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2714.54 2715.84 SPEAKER_02  No, he's a member for Neom North.
2718.20 2720.36 SPEAKER_05  Neom North is weirdly a Lib Dem constituency.
2720.36 2721.36 SPEAKER_05  Neom North is a member of the United States.
2721.36 2721.38 None  Yeah.
2721.38 2721.44 None  Yeah.
2721.44 2721.94 None  Yeah.
2721.94 2722.38 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
2722.38 2723.32 SPEAKER_05  Le Dem's winning here.
2723.44 2726.26 SPEAKER_07  It's a very thin constituency, but a very long one.
2726.44 2726.98 SPEAKER_07  That's right.
2726.98 2728.18 SPEAKER_02  Neom Alam.
2728.30 2728.58 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2730.44 2731.60 SPEAKER_02  So basically, right.
2731.70 2732.30 SPEAKER_02  It's a, yeah.
2732.30 2735.38 SPEAKER_02  He's like, this is someone who's on the right of the party, right?
2735.38 2735.50 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2735.50 2737.06 SPEAKER_02  Someone who supported Owen Smith, right?
2737.12 2737.56 SPEAKER_02  This is.
2739.20 2739.32 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2739.36 2739.64 SPEAKER_07  Sorry.
2739.72 2740.80 SPEAKER_07  I just remembered Owen Smith.
2741.28 2742.48 SPEAKER_02  He loves a frothy coffee.
2742.58 2742.72 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2742.98 2743.16 SPEAKER_02  So.
2744.92 2746.06 SPEAKER_02  Damn simpler times.
2746.42 2748.50 SPEAKER_02  So these are, these are two guys on the right of the party.
2748.50 2751.52 SPEAKER_02  Let's look at like the defenses that, that first come out.
2751.52 2751.74 SPEAKER_02  Right.
2752.04 2759.90 SPEAKER_02  Which is number one, the defense for Azar Ali from Nick Thomas Simmons was a front bencher said, look, those comments are totally wrong.
2760.26 2766.34 SPEAKER_02  However, we should look past them as the counselor has clearly only fallen for an online conspiracy theory.
2766.80 2767.42 SPEAKER_02  Oh, okay.
2767.42 2768.90 SPEAKER_02  So he's just stupid.
2769.30 2780.64 SPEAKER_07  The quote it says is he fell for an online conspiracy theory and that does not represent his view, which is like philosophically incredible that he both fell for it and doesn't believe it.
2780.74 2780.98 SPEAKER_07  It is.
2781.08 2784.08 SPEAKER_07  He said it and also fell for it, but also that's not his view.
2784.26 2787.28 SPEAKER_01  Like he has perfect cognitive dissonance about it.
2787.28 2789.68 SPEAKER_07  He both believes and does not believe this.
2789.90 2791.84 SPEAKER_05  It's clearly true, but I don't believe it.
2791.98 2793.64 SPEAKER_05  He's a blindside vampire.
2793.78 2794.98 SPEAKER_05  I can't believe it's not Israel.
2795.08 2797.40 SPEAKER_07  He believes it and it's true, but it's not justified.
2797.40 2803.92 SPEAKER_02  Our candidate is just simply is very easily tricked.
2804.28 2806.46 SPEAKER_02  He did not think he was espousing that view.
2806.66 2812.40 SPEAKER_02  He thought he was saying a magical incantation that would bring a beanstalk out of the ground.
2812.58 2814.34 SPEAKER_01  This is not a political view.
2814.48 2824.60 SPEAKER_01  And again, not to make the obvious point, which we're going to hammer home for the rest of this segment, but like people got kicked out of the party for a lot less than this.
2825.10 2825.18 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2825.54 2829.32 SPEAKER_01  Very recently in relation to accusations of anti-Semitism.
2829.74 2829.86 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
2830.06 2830.26 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2830.48 2833.28 SPEAKER_02  This is, yeah, like Facebook likes 10 years ago.
2833.44 2833.86 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, exactly.
2834.00 2845.14 SPEAKER_02  You know, and, you know, again, this is, they, everyone rushed to his defense until again, more leaks came out about him talking about like, quote unquote, the media triple brackets.
2845.32 2845.96 SPEAKER_02  Oh, dear.
2845.96 2848.08 SPEAKER_02  Again, this is what the implication of what he was saying.
2848.08 2849.12 SPEAKER_02  And then they were like, okay.
2849.12 2851.64 SPEAKER_02  And he got sued for plagiarism because that was someone else's theory.
2852.16 2853.62 SPEAKER_05  So then we, um.
2853.62 2854.90 SPEAKER_05  Jennifer Billick, furious.
2856.42 2856.86 SPEAKER_01  So.
2857.08 2858.48 SPEAKER_05  He's ripping me off.
2858.74 2861.68 SPEAKER_01  Just one anti-Semite, everyone else is a plagiarist.
2862.16 2863.00 SPEAKER_01  That's right.
2863.10 2864.44 SPEAKER_01  Just no original thinking.
2864.62 2865.52 SPEAKER_02  Just really lazy.
2866.78 2867.02 SPEAKER_02  No.
2867.34 2867.54 SPEAKER_02  No.
2867.72 2867.90 SPEAKER_02  Right.
2868.20 2871.40 SPEAKER_02  And then, of course, he gets disassociated and so on and so on.
2871.58 2871.84 SPEAKER_01  Now.
2872.20 2881.08 SPEAKER_01  Although it's now too late for Labour to unendorse him, which is sort of hysterical because Keir Starmer is being forced to endorse him against his will.
2881.30 2881.52 SPEAKER_07  Yeah.
2881.68 2882.98 SPEAKER_07  So is he in or not?
2883.02 2883.48 SPEAKER_07  Is he the candidate or not?
2883.48 2883.66 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2883.66 2884.98 SPEAKER_01  He's running as a Labour candidate.
2884.98 2888.22 SPEAKER_02  Well, Keir Starmer is both endorsing and not endorsing him.
2888.50 2888.94 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2888.94 2889.30 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2889.70 2889.94 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2889.94 2890.22 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2890.22 2890.54 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2890.54 2899.42 SPEAKER_02  And also, like, number one, I do hope he wins just so I can start really influencing- I want to own one member of Parliament with Facebook, like, ad buying.
2899.78 2900.28 SPEAKER_02  That's all.
2900.70 2904.82 SPEAKER_01  Just one extremely gullible MP you can sway into sort of anything.
2905.26 2908.16 SPEAKER_02  I think we can get a full import ban on natural wine.
2908.24 2909.18 SPEAKER_02  I think we can do it.
2910.22 2910.62 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2910.66 2912.22 SPEAKER_02  Just say that it's causing chemtrails.
2912.34 2912.52 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2913.14 2924.12 SPEAKER_02  But Graham Jones, the other guy who's involved here, who, again, like, just was clearly very frustrated with Israel in this meeting in the last October, right?
2924.32 2927.02 SPEAKER_02  Why would anyone be frustrated with Israel in the current climate?
2927.20 2927.68 SPEAKER_02  I don't know why.
2928.06 2930.00 SPEAKER_02  Again, we reported what he said.
2930.10 2931.10 SPEAKER_02  That's all that's being reported.
2931.10 2938.94 SPEAKER_01  And being, like, hoist by your own petard, right, because it's something that you only have to be frustrated about privately if you don't have the spine to be frustrated about it publicly.
2939.36 2942.88 SPEAKER_02  And so this is- but again, like, he is a very, very weird guy.
2942.96 2956.24 SPEAKER_02  His own electoral history is full of, like- his history in Parliament is, um, is, like, mostly about getting revenge against another guy from his town who he hated.
2956.74 2957.98 SPEAKER_02  I do support that.
2957.98 2958.76 SPEAKER_02  Uh-huh.
2958.90 2961.50 SPEAKER_02  Like, he is, uh, it's- it's very amusing.
2961.90 2963.86 SPEAKER_02  Or this guy, uh, Peter Britcliffe.
2964.18 2965.96 SPEAKER_02  He's just, like, constantly gets it.
2966.16 2968.16 SPEAKER_02  Peter Britcliffe was his conservative opponent.
2968.44 2972.30 SPEAKER_02  And mostly they just got in, like, side yard disputes with one another.
2972.50 2973.92 SPEAKER_02  It's very, very amusing.
2974.22 2974.82 SPEAKER_06  Mm-hmm.
2975.16 2975.60 SPEAKER_02  Harassment.
2975.74 2976.44 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, essentially.
2976.90 2978.02 SPEAKER_01  Like, it's very, very amusing.
2978.02 2989.16 SPEAKER_01  So, so, so, so, so, so, like, the in-the-loop thing where, like, you are doing, like, consequential matters about, like, foreign policy in the world and also in a dispute about a guy's garden wall.
2989.36 2990.68 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2990.98 3008.46 SPEAKER_02  This is, this is, um, reported in the Lancashire Telegraph, like, I was just looking into this, is that, like, when he was replaced by his ancient enemy in 2019, uh, the, the enemy, this guy, Britcliffe, then, like, went to a nightclub wearing a picture with Graham Jones's face printed on it.
3008.92 3011.22 SPEAKER_07  Like, they fucking hate each other.
3011.46 3011.88 SPEAKER_07  Like, what?
3012.06 3016.00 SPEAKER_07  Replaced by his ancient enemy, like, the Horned King won the Biden election.
3016.24 3016.70 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, yeah.
3016.70 3020.18 SPEAKER_01  I mean, Lancashire elections are kind of not too far off from that, I suspect.
3020.18 3020.48 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
3020.74 3022.26 SPEAKER_05  He's a fucking Yorkshireman.
3022.64 3031.58 SPEAKER_05  They went, he went to a nightclub wearing a picture of, uh, Graham Jones's top surgery as a stark warning to other potential parliamentary candidates.
3032.16 3035.22 SPEAKER_05  No, like, Graham Jones has got a serious pair of Bolton's these days.
3035.22 3035.36 SPEAKER_02  It's so funny.
3035.52 3038.10 SPEAKER_02  These two guys have hated each other since 2010.
3038.90 3040.02 SPEAKER_02  I mean, wow.
3040.16 3042.62 SPEAKER_02  I love this, you know, it's a sort of romance for the ages.
3042.74 3045.90 SPEAKER_02  Anyway, but, so getting back to it though, right, Jones, yeah, this weird guy.
3046.30 3049.68 SPEAKER_02  Weird guy caught on a hot mic being, like, fucking Israel.
3049.68 3050.04 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3050.42 3052.34 SPEAKER_02  Weird, but least weird thing.
3052.64 3052.84 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3053.12 3057.14 SPEAKER_02  Ed Balls then goes on TV and says, let's get, stand back and get some facts.
3057.44 3061.42 SPEAKER_02  Graham Jones, he's not a Corbidite, he's not hard left, and he's not anti-Israel.
3061.42 3063.90 SPEAKER_02  You could all imagine saying, fuck America.
3064.46 3066.98 SPEAKER_02  No right winger could ever be anti-Semitic.
3067.58 3069.88 SPEAKER_01  That's a tendency exclusively of the left.
3069.90 3072.84 SPEAKER_07  That's interesting because he's kind of given the game away there, isn't it?
3072.86 3076.80 SPEAKER_07  Because not Corbidite, not hard left, absolutely not anti-Israel.
3077.02 3081.62 SPEAKER_07  Like, there's a kind of, like, non-sequiturs, but you can see the sort of associative reasoning taking place.
3081.66 3085.26 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, the meaning there is, like, not fair game for these sorts of attacks.
3085.26 3094.94 SPEAKER_01  And you've been seeing briefing from within the Labour Party that has been sort of, like, frustration at, you know, the Board of Deputies or the Jewish Labour Movement.
3095.16 3096.46 SPEAKER_01  I'm not sure if it is the Jewish Labour Movement.
3096.54 3107.98 SPEAKER_01  But, like, against, like, certain Jewish organisations that have been, like, publicising these and critiquing these things as evidence of anti-Semitism, being like, no, you're not supposed to do it to us, right?
3108.30 3121.20 SPEAKER_01  And sort of, like, taking what was an unacceptable line under Corbyn of, this is clearly pure factionalism, is completely baseless and exists only to kind of discredit the Labour Party.
3121.58 3124.72 SPEAKER_01  And I simply go, interesting, when did that come in?
3125.06 3130.28 SPEAKER_01  You know, when did that start being a thing that it was possible to say, you know?
3130.28 3133.36 SPEAKER_07  Seems like you've constructed this incredible petard here.
3134.40 3136.08 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, nice petard.
3136.08 3143.18 SPEAKER_05  It's just you've made this very nice bed, and yet you find yourself increasingly reluctant to line it.
3144.50 3149.20 SPEAKER_07  As it's being hoisted, you might look down and notice that this petard is hauntingly familiar.
3151.14 3152.50 SPEAKER_03  My God.
3153.14 3154.48 SPEAKER_02  Now, my own petard.
3155.28 3160.86 SPEAKER_02  And you come back, and yet now the demand is, well, everybody at this meeting should be suspended and investigated.
3161.38 3171.64 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, because it's running out of control, again, because you've had this kind of, factional weapon that bears very little overlap with real antisemitism.
3171.64 3195.64 SPEAKER_01  And now it's simply rolling through the Labour Party going, okay, well, anybody who even dares to critique Israel or the IDF or Zionism as an ideology is inherently antisemitic and has to go.
3195.94 3201.08 SPEAKER_01  And it's only a matter of time until they find something Starmer's said in the past, and that's going to be a funny moment.
3201.94 3206.20 SPEAKER_07  Well, this is what Jewish left-wing activists have warned about as well.
3206.20 3219.70 SPEAKER_07  There's a fantastic activist called April Rosenblum who wrote a pamphlet called The Past Didn't Go Anywhere, where she actually talks about what are constructive ways to criticize the actions of the Israeli government and what are ways that do give cover to antisemites.
3219.74 3228.94 SPEAKER_07  Because there are some people who are just really antisemitic who will host a meeting, and the meeting's called free speech on Israel, and then you turn up and you're like, oh, everyone's doing Hitler salutes, right?
3229.00 3230.40 SPEAKER_07  That sort of thing does fucking happen.
3230.40 3238.96 SPEAKER_07  There is antisemitism on the left, like genuinely, and not only just Nazis using it for cover, but also there are people who are left-wing genuinely and who are also genuinely antisemitic.
3239.22 3250.72 SPEAKER_07  But then what April Rosenblum cautions is that the effect of this situation is that it becomes impossible to criticize or even really talk accurately about what the Israeli government are really doing.
3251.54 3256.48 SPEAKER_07  What Rosenblum, if you're interested to know, what she recommends is just being as specific as possible.
3256.48 3264.40 SPEAKER_07  So rather than, for instance, an example of a bad way of doing it would be to say, oh, Israel are controlling the US government, right?
3264.44 3267.24 SPEAKER_07  That's very clearly a bad antisemitism territory there.
3267.54 3273.18 SPEAKER_07  More specific would be to say, like, AIPAC gives this amount of money to these politicians to support these policies, which I disagree with.
3273.24 3279.10 SPEAKER_07  The more specific you can be, she says, as a Jewish left-wing activist, then the more helpful and constructive the conversation becomes.
3279.42 3281.52 SPEAKER_07  Name and CLP, please, Abby.
3284.16 3285.42 SPEAKER_02  None, proudly.
3285.42 3286.86 SPEAKER_02  Anyway, anyway.
3287.38 3296.94 SPEAKER_02  To bring this back around, of course, to Starmer, before we sort of finish off, is that what he has done at every stage of this is he has allowed himself,
3297.18 3305.10 SPEAKER_01  he has allowed selective legal... He has tolerated two instances of heinous antisemitism, and yet he refuses to apologize, and so he simply must resign.
3305.36 3306.64 SPEAKER_01  And he minimized them as well.
3306.94 3307.16 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3307.52 3308.38 SPEAKER_01  Briefing against them.
3308.48 3309.60 SPEAKER_01  It's time to go.
3309.80 3316.68 SPEAKER_01  It's simply unacceptable in this day and age for a leader of the Labour Party to traffic in such sort of reprehensible racism, you know?
3316.86 3332.60 SPEAKER_02  What he, of course, did was he allowed himself to be basically just bounced into seemingly random reactions to just, like, selective leaks to the right-wing press, which, of course, will never happen when he's in government.
3332.74 3332.96 SPEAKER_02  Ever.
3333.38 3334.48 SPEAKER_02  That will never happen again.
3334.52 3336.10 SPEAKER_01  It's just the begging thing again.
3336.28 3336.52 SPEAKER_02  You know?
3336.56 3337.18 SPEAKER_02  It's just like, please...
3337.18 3338.20 SPEAKER_02  He drank from the puddle!
3338.48 3338.66 None  Yeah.
3339.72 3342.04 SPEAKER_02  He looked at the right-wing press, right?
3342.32 3347.02 SPEAKER_02  He looked at these, again, leaks, which were, again, recorded months ago, but just released now, right?
3347.12 3349.20 SPEAKER_02  And clearly released one after the other.
3349.30 3352.62 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, kept in stock, you know, to, like, drip feed these out.
3352.76 3356.06 SPEAKER_01  The key takeaway from this whole sorry debacle is that I'm not gay.
3356.42 3360.12 SPEAKER_05  I think I've made that very clear in all of my statements upon this matter.
3360.62 3361.94 SPEAKER_05  And I think I consider it now closed.
3361.94 3367.70 SPEAKER_00  Well, look, drinking from the puddle is actually a really good demonstration of what children can do when they're banned from buying energy drinks.
3367.70 3367.92 SPEAKER_00  True.
3368.16 3368.46 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
3368.68 3369.36 SPEAKER_05  I have a question.
3369.36 3370.90 SPEAKER_05  Anyway, there's no caffeine in the puddle.
3370.94 3374.42 SPEAKER_07  If this was recorded months ago, why has it only come out now?
3374.74 3375.38 SPEAKER_07  Genuine question.
3375.76 3378.64 SPEAKER_01  Cynical leverage of it for political expedience.
3378.74 3381.58 SPEAKER_07  But what does it get the people leaking it to do that now?
3381.92 3384.02 SPEAKER_01  Well, labour's popular now, basically.
3384.38 3386.10 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, it's in the rainy day fund.
3386.26 3387.66 SPEAKER_01  Like, any sort of, like...
3387.66 3390.04 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, transferring audio is also really hard these times.
3390.04 3392.20 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, they had a bunch of attempts.
3392.42 3400.92 SPEAKER_01  No, what it is is that, like, any sort of, like, political operator of this caliber has a filing cabinet full of stuff to just drop as needed.
3401.36 3404.22 SPEAKER_01  And this is in the, like, the rainy day file for...
3404.22 3407.18 SPEAKER_01  You need to, like, sort of throw a grenade into the labour camp.
3407.42 3411.62 SPEAKER_05  There's a huge drawer with a padlock on it that says, Keir Starmer tasteful nudes.
3412.46 3414.46 SPEAKER_05  Which they've not even cracked open yet.
3414.92 3415.88 SPEAKER_02  Anyway, anyway.
3416.20 3419.50 SPEAKER_02  That's about an hour, and so probably all we have time for today.
3419.50 3423.90 SPEAKER_02  However, I would like to thank our guest, Abby, for coming and returning to us today.
3424.60 3427.64 SPEAKER_02  I would like to remind everybody that there is a Patreon.
3427.78 3429.98 SPEAKER_02  You can subscribe to it for $5 every month.
3430.08 3430.98 SPEAKER_02  You fucking can.
3431.46 3437.38 SPEAKER_02  A reminder, it will be more expensive if you do it from the iOS app, from inside the app,
3437.48 3438.00 SPEAKER_01  from March.
3438.12 3440.94 SPEAKER_02  You have to cut out Tim Apple, the middleman.
3441.16 3442.52 SPEAKER_01  Otherwise, you'll pay more.
3442.52 3448.92 SPEAKER_02  And, also, there is going to be a live show in London on March the 13th.
3448.92 3450.34 SPEAKER_05  13th. Yeah, that's right.
3450.42 3450.66 SPEAKER_01  Yes.
3450.88 3451.90 SPEAKER_01  Backyard Comedy Club.
3452.42 3453.26 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, that's right.
3453.46 3455.50 SPEAKER_05  Backyard Comedy Club, where they do Comedy Unleashed.
3455.96 3456.16 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
3456.28 3457.20 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, it should be fun.
3457.46 3458.34 SPEAKER_07  Is it inside?
3458.62 3461.76 SPEAKER_07  Because, listeners, every time I've gone to a TF live show, Milo always books it.
3461.84 3466.80 SPEAKER_07  And Milo, you know I love you very much, but you don't understand that it's cold outside.
3466.80 3469.80 SPEAKER_05  You keep fucking venues when it's outdoors.
3469.80 3471.66 SPEAKER_05  I mean, between the bridges is inside.
3471.76 3472.84 SPEAKER_05  It's just inside a tent.
3473.62 3474.10 SPEAKER_05  Outside!
3474.10 3474.54 SPEAKER_06  Outside!
3475.66 3476.06 SPEAKER_05  Maybe!
3476.72 3478.52 SPEAKER_05  No, it's not the same as outside.
3478.78 3479.72 SPEAKER_04  It is outside.
3479.86 3480.58 SPEAKER_05  It's not a tent.
3480.84 3483.86 SPEAKER_05  I'm just going to end this little Socratic dialogue.
3484.12 3486.68 SPEAKER_05  A tent is still inside.
3487.16 3489.80 SPEAKER_05  It's just, I agree that it's not as well insulated as conventional buildings.
3489.80 3492.70 SPEAKER_07  The last time I went to a TF live show, I was too cold to laugh.
3492.70 3500.60 SPEAKER_02  The funniest thing to do would be for Nate to cut off the audio right as the crescendo of people arguing about the tent happens.
3502.34 3502.78 SPEAKER_01  Okay.
3503.32 3503.92 SPEAKER_02  I have plugs.
3504.04 3505.04 SPEAKER_00  Not a tent, it's a new build.
3505.84 3509.08 SPEAKER_01  I'm excited to be on the same stage that Graham Lennon has been on.
3509.08 3510.72 SPEAKER_01  It is inside, it's in a building.
3510.98 3512.04 None  Okay, good, thank God.
3512.56 3514.22 SPEAKER_07  Listeners, I wrote a film.
3514.58 3519.42 SPEAKER_07  It's about two women dealing with the trauma they got from a bad relationship, and they're both vampires because their ex is Count Dracula.
3519.58 3520.82 SPEAKER_07  It's called Dracula's Ex-Girlfriend.
3521.12 3522.40 SPEAKER_07  I'm flying to LA to film it.
3522.70 3524.86 SPEAKER_07  In less than a week.
3525.28 3529.38 SPEAKER_07  And that will be out on Nebula at some point when we finish editing it.
3529.56 3530.26 SPEAKER_07  That's my plug.
3530.48 3534.86 SPEAKER_07  I'm going to be in a fucking movie that I wrote that we're filming in Hollywood about vampires.
3535.44 3536.18 SPEAKER_07  It's going to be sick.
3536.60 3539.92 SPEAKER_02  So, look out for that to be released.
3540.14 3540.58 SPEAKER_02  That's right.
3540.64 3542.94 SPEAKER_02  And if you're in LA, check it out.
3543.22 3543.48 SPEAKER_02  Anyway.
3543.84 3545.56 SPEAKER_02  If you're in LA, just drive around.
3546.22 3549.66 SPEAKER_01  It's one of the key cinematic pleasures of the city you live in.
3549.72 3550.78 SPEAKER_01  You might see Abbey, you might not.
3550.86 3552.36 SPEAKER_01  But most importantly, you'll have a nice drive.
3552.36 3558.00 SPEAKER_07  I am going to look, because they have to give me temporary tattoos and also nail extensions for the duration of the filming.
3558.22 3559.98 SPEAKER_07  So I'm going to look quite frightening.
3560.22 3561.96 SPEAKER_07  If you see me around, I will look unfamiliar.
3562.56 3563.56 SPEAKER_07  You'll think I've gone mad.
3564.16 3564.36 SPEAKER_02  Okay.
3564.56 3564.86 SPEAKER_07  All right.
3564.98 3565.26 SPEAKER_02  All right.
3565.94 3566.72 SPEAKER_02  Thank you very much.
3566.72 3567.78 SPEAKER_05  Come see me on tour in Australia.
3568.16 3568.44 SPEAKER_05  Oh, goodness.
3568.64 3569.62 SPEAKER_05  You've got your stuff too.
3569.62 3570.94 SPEAKER_05  You know, I won't go on my website.
3570.96 3574.56 SPEAKER_01  Come see like three Kill James Bond live shows.
3574.76 3575.04 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
3575.26 3576.06 SPEAKER_01  There are three of those.
3576.26 3576.36 SPEAKER_01  Good.
3576.48 3578.60 SPEAKER_07  Oh, my dress for the second one arrived today.
3579.32 3581.08 SPEAKER_01  Eighth, ninth and tenth of March.
3581.18 3582.26 SPEAKER_01  The eighth is sold out.
3582.36 3584.94 SPEAKER_01  There are like a couple of tickets for the ninth left.
3585.14 3587.84 SPEAKER_01  And the tenth, there are a decent few left.
3588.34 3589.36 SPEAKER_01  So book those on KillJamesBond.com.
3589.36 3591.46 SPEAKER_07  The outfits get more slutty as we go.
3591.62 3595.54 SPEAKER_07  So you do want to be there on the final night, which is also the night when we get to party afterwards.
3595.92 3596.42 SPEAKER_02  Also true.
3596.86 3600.88 SPEAKER_02  I am going on April 6th to Malahunta at Fold.
3601.44 3602.42 SPEAKER_02  Come see me there.
3602.68 3603.98 SPEAKER_01  What else have we got in our calendars?
3604.04 3606.18 SPEAKER_01  Let me crack this shit open right here.
3606.30 3608.84 SPEAKER_01  I've got a driving lesson on the 22nd.
3608.84 3611.16 SPEAKER_05  That is your worst nightmare.
3611.38 3613.58 SPEAKER_05  You don't want people talking to you in real life.
3613.84 3616.40 SPEAKER_05  That's such a wrong chest move from you.
3616.82 3617.32 SPEAKER_05  Why have you?
3619.36 3620.00 SPEAKER_02  Okay, all right.
3620.02 3621.92 SPEAKER_02  This plug segment has gone up for one million years.
3622.02 3622.40 SPEAKER_02  Let's go.
3622.54 3623.04 SPEAKER_02  Bye, everybody.
3623.18 3623.40 SPEAKER_02  Bye.
