0.00 37.86 SPEAKER_04  Hello and welcome to this it's Monday free episode of TF. We have a bumper episode for you all that's right we have back in the seat after paternity leave the uh bulldog with the big labia from the uh labor party ai we're gonna deport the immigrants the excel pussy
37.86 46.20 SPEAKER_03  hussain welcome back after two months is over the plate minute one
46.20 77.94 SPEAKER_02  the excel pussy is back um yeah also there is like there is a non-zero chance but like my kid will be crying in the background um so just so just just ignore that because he also just saw the labor party um tiktok and he's very upset about it yeah because he's gen alpha so he knows how to do social media which the labor party don't also he just he just about made the gen alpha cut because you know like if he was born next like if he was a 2026 baby he would have been a gen beta yeah oh god and then i would have had to this but i would have had my kid's gonna be a sigma i'm gonna
77.94 97.78 SPEAKER_04  have him in my 50s and of course joining us again to talk more about what is becoming a bit of a specialist subject forum on the show uh the i would say on purpose torpedoing of a big part of the internet because mark zuckerberg cannot imagine what another person would want it is 404 media's
97.78 109.02 SPEAKER_00  jason kebler jason thank you for joining us again hey stoked to be here stoked that there's uh constantly reason for me to be here i love it first of all i just want to ask as an american
109.02 116.66 SPEAKER_04  what did you think of our awesome labor party political tiktok animal furry broadcast i thought
116.66 135.50 SPEAKER_00  it was a very bold choice um i i haven't like not been able to follow what the hell is going on over there um i think because elon has muddied the water so much that i just i can't follow it at all but this tiktok with the lions etc really cleared things up so beautiful use of ai yeah look this is
135.50 157.14 SPEAKER_04  just part of building god is you need a bunch of like you know like you need a bunch of the most just repellent freaks in all of london which is like a big that's a high bar to clear to be like what are young people like how are we going to reach out to young people i know why don't we create a kind of series of horrible melting homunculi that we've then put the same like controls on
157.14 192.74 SPEAKER_03  immigration like that's going to be their version of the fucking ed mug well it's it's it's interesting right to see something that's disgusting on two levels right firstly on the level that all ai slop is but secondly that because as you say it's invented by labor party strategists it's still going to feel inauthentic to uh you know gen alpha who like their you know like their actual slop like their ai slop made by people who know what they're doing so it's like it's a it's an imitation of something that's already wrong and is therefore like a kind of doubly uncanny a a slop just like
192.74 201.02 SPEAKER_06  a mama used to make a little grocachino for a baby yeah yeah did did we see that the uh the democrats
201.02 215.30 SPEAKER_00  also are in the u.s are did this they owned elon musk and donald trump with the uh elon musk like leash and donald trump is like a dog of some sort uh ai image this is like the democrats big big plan to
215.30 219.56 SPEAKER_06  you know the democrats never understand when something is going to be horny do they they
219.56 227.44 SPEAKER_04  don't they don't have any barometer for that at all they can't see how horny that is as an image look there's one guy that's really going to appeal to
227.44 234.80 SPEAKER_02  one guy and that guy lives in like the most important swing state in the country oh my god
234.80 256.34 SPEAKER_04  you so you're saying you've just recast there was a movie called swing vote where if you remember it's like one guy in montana is going to decide the whole presidential election for whatever reason it's all down to him and like like bill pullman or whatever is trying to sway him swing vote two is the human pet guy is the deciding vote in the u.s presidential election to me oh my god
256.34 273.36 SPEAKER_03  get the cybersmith on side it has to be done because that guy's british so he would i want to hear well i don't want to hear his opinion on the on the labor party big pussy xl bully video but like i feel like i'm going to now like at some point i mean i'm filled with this like grim resignation
273.36 278.46 SPEAKER_06  yeah i think i'm just like really taken with the idea of starmer having to like trawl through
278.46 309.30 SPEAKER_05  tiktok to decide what their next strategy is going to be it's gonna be like look i've been looking at what the voters we want to target are engaging with on tiktok we're going to do weird ripped animals we're going to do an xl bully with a big pussy and then next i go to be interviewed in a room that looks faintly like it's something from a ray winston movie in the 70s and then i go to explain a bunch of chilling crimes i did but got away with in the 70s because it was a lark back then and because things hadn't gone work that seems to be what people like maybe i'll go to jubai have we
309.30 314.78 SPEAKER_03  considered that maybe keir starmer keir starmer is just a dan henchel bit that got out of hand
314.78 339.22 SPEAKER_04  because he's already had one of those this week why not go for two before we get on to our our discussion of musk and then zuck and then a little bit of a reading i want to add my idea for the new labor party um tiktok strategy now that also the song they put over their xl pussy video turned out to be like an extremely sexually explicit like i don't know kazakh language rap video
339.22 346.12 SPEAKER_03  yeah rap lyrics i love social media i feel he wants to appeal to the step horseman that's what he's
346.12 390.30 SPEAKER_04  going for that's that's the thing right swing vote three okay swing vote three that's the thing right is like if i hate to be sincere for a moment on this sort of opening sort of chit chat uh element but if you're going to decide okay we're not going to give anyone anything that they really want what we're going to do is you know apart from the human pet guy he's getting everything he wants yeah yeah that guy that guy's being appealed to uh is that you at least have to make people you're the whole strategy of not giving anyone anything real is you have to make people like you and identify with you and feel like you're going to be like them in office even if you're not going to really do anything in particular you know and so the vibes yes so the vibes they're putting out on purpose
390.30 395.10 SPEAKER_06  it's just you're very bad at this he needs to get elected the same way that gary barlow sells rose
395.10 415.72 SPEAKER_04  but my my idea right is the tiktok trend and i think we can do this right if we all tag toronto like suburban toronto like street interview accounts in the labor party tiktok we can get them watching suburban toronto street interviews and kirk starmer being interviewed with an ontarian
415.72 427.84 SPEAKER_05  accent with a weirdly tiny microphone yes yes if the business is true well it in fact is true because i'm very committed to business and let me tell you what makes me sick to my stomach fam uh yes the uh
427.84 456.70 SPEAKER_04  kirk starmer uh kirk starmer suggests that uh the the labor left is no longer croties with him that's uh what a fucking stupid language look i want to talk about some stuff right i want to talk for the first about british politics in the way that has been continuing to go which is of course elon musk has decided to make britain the worked example of this is what happens when you do not have a national security oriented plan for what to do about elon musk yeah or to put it more bluntly this is
456.70 474.40 SPEAKER_03  what happens when you you've you're like national security state has lost the ability to assassinate people it would be it would be all you have to do is give grimes a bag of fent-laced ketamine yeah it's like tenets she's just like going undercover i saw a woman diving out of the edge of the
474.40 481.90 SPEAKER_06  cyber truck i don't know who she was i don't understand it we've sent several honey traps after mr musk and he hasn't bitten have you tried sending a woman no we hadn't thought of that
481.90 497.96 SPEAKER_04  where am i six god damn it what do you think this is military intelligence now i mean this is looking across looking over at this from from the states and sort of being like you know an elon follower jason i'm curious what your view is on like what has made him so obsessed with
497.96 530.58 SPEAKER_00  britain all of a sudden i mean honestly i think it's something where he got what he wanted in the united states and he's like what what now i mean he's obsessed with germany he's obsessed with the far right platform in germany and now he's very obsessed with pedophilia rings in the united kingdom seemingly and just like using his influence there um i don't i don't think there's much more to it than that i don't have like a very funny answer here other than he's seeking to like influence politics all over the world and he is king of the united states now and he's he's already bored with
530.58 587.30 SPEAKER_03  that i think the boredom thing is interesting because like he has a very limited attention span and he also is like an eminently bullyable person right like the thing that i keep coming back to besides having elon musk assassinated is that they banned twitter in brazil for like a week and as a result of that elon has not been posting any like bolsonaro shit like all of the guys all the brazilian guys who like uh he had to ban in order to get twitter back online can't stand him anymore and it's like okay if brazil can stand up to him admittedly like the uk is a joke of a country but like if it just remembers that it is a country for a second and decides to turn on the big is a government switch then you know obviously we hate doing that in this country but if we did he would fold because of course he folds because he's just like able to do that and just move on to the next thing and next week he's tweeting about i don't know fucking belgium or something domineous to get brazil
587.30 628.58 SPEAKER_00  pills i mean that that's absolutely right because elon says nothing about china like nothing about xi jinping and that's because all of his companies are so tied up in in china like he relies on china so much and one would think that elon has quite a lot to say about china but he doesn't do anything about it he doesn't say anything about it he doesn't say anything about russia either and the the brazil point is a really big one because he was talking mad shit about brazil brazil actually went through with a ban and brazil won it's like they just regulated his company and he folded immediately yeah fucking i mean lula just put him on the dog leash essentially yeah yeah because i would love to
628.58 635.64 SPEAKER_06  see elon must do the john cena mandarin apology video nothing nothing i would enjoy more than that
635.64 642.30 SPEAKER_03  to keir starmer and jess phillips and his best british accent yeah yeah yeah right here old chap i mean i
642.30 653.90 SPEAKER_04  i think i think it'd be really funny if like the only way to fight back against elon musk is you have to become like a based brick spilled multilateralist i mean kind of i kind of do believe
653.90 674.48 SPEAKER_03  that at this point like let me in the near future like anti-nato like you know the fucking shanghai treaty organization or whatever because like the the new polarization is power block that like is being walked on a dog leash by elon musk and power block that is walking elon musk on a dog leash elon musk is
674.48 685.60 SPEAKER_06  like an irony of history pandora's box type situation for us where it's like you know over a hundred years later there's one boor that it's morally right for us to extrajudicially jail for the rest of his life
685.60 720.48 SPEAKER_04  in order to in order to overcome our past that is what we must do as you sort of alluded to jason he's really focused on this whole sort of uh grooming gangs hysteria which has come up sort of occasionally and repeatedly as a sort of as an islamophobic canard for the last 10 years it comes up whenever is needed you know like and there have been a few a few developments right which is you know we'll go through them one at a time which is that you know when is that he's now fully just like without saying without saying it calling for like you know stochastic violence against like labor moderate front
720.48 735.36 SPEAKER_03  pinchers against jess phillips specifically like that's the weirdest part of this is like jess phillips is it's the same thing we talked about with um you know in previous episodes with starma right is that like these are people who don't believe in anything except that it's their
735.36 745.74 SPEAKER_04  turn on the xbox controller just just just briefly jason for your context this is like if he incited stochastic terrorism against amy klobuchar yeah he said amy klobuchar's got a staper and she's not
745.74 794.08 SPEAKER_03  afraid to use it yeah she's she's just kind of around right she doesn't really believe in anything and this this fucking ketamine addict is doing his level best to get her assassinated and it's like when political assassination uh like really comes back onto the radar it's directed that these people the most bland inoffensive like obviously they're they're dickheads right but like to even muster up that strength of feeling against them on the basis of like i saw a bunch of tiktoks about how they're like uh doing child trafficking or whatever the fuck it's just insane i think that the real like story of our times and in the uk and elsewhere is that we have this like atomized radical element that's willing to be agitated in pursuit of absolutely like fucked causes it's the years of
794.08 817.82 SPEAKER_04  lead poisoning i i'd say right you almost when you're thinking about this like it's almost it baffles the mind right because someone like that like a labor front bench or a centrist democrat or whatever they come up in their various like you know greasy poles that they climb in the student union arguing against a tepid statement on their university's investment oil and gas companies you're working every day having like salmon breakfast with major donors you know for your time as like a special
817.82 829.46 SPEAKER_03  advisor you spent decades polishing that and like getting getting your degree in politics only to find out that no politics doesn't work like that anymore instead politics works like this yeah it's like bam
829.46 839.44 SPEAKER_04  you thought you were going to enjoy like your prize for putting in all of your institutional grafting and then elon musk reaches out of an interdimensional k-hole and it's like yeah someone
839.44 904.24 SPEAKER_02  should kill this person i think this is like so interesting as a like just an observation of what politics is going to what because we're going to see a lot more in common like when i was away and i was like listening to some of the episodes and also paying like a very base level attention to the news like obviously one of the things that seems to be like everyone seems to agree is going to be very common is just like incoherent um or increases in like incoherent forms of violence and if you like see like extend that a little bit more and you've got to think about what type of character is elon i was thinking a little bit about the pandemic in 2020 and when he was like he this was before he bought twitter but he was using it a lot and i think one of the things we talked about but like people in our circle talked about it a lot which was the ways in which he was basically pumping shit coins and potentially using that to like prop up some of his businesses and that wasn't proven but i think there was like a very like convincing case for that to be but even like the secondary component of that is that like i think he i think he realized that just by posting he could get a lot of attention and he could get a lot of like this very weird following some of whom were true believers but other people who were just like wanting to sort of dick ride him yeah we found
904.24 910.46 SPEAKER_03  the the only german in fiji outside of a christian shark novel and you know there's like and just like
910.46 923.40 SPEAKER_02  you know you look at any any one of his tweets and like the people who are retweeting and the people who are following him like half of like his replies don't even engage with what he says it's like this very bizarre type of ai speak that may be from actual real people but also like maybe bots
923.40 928.04 SPEAKER_06  themselves it could be someone who's actually an xl bully with a huge pussy we don't know exactly the
928.04 1017.18 SPEAKER_02  amount of exposure you get just by sort of that engagement and like the way that the blue check system has been built around that premise the whole point is being i think he realizes like both in the nature or at least i don't know i don't know if that's giving him too much credit in terms of the fact that he realizes but he's certainly like the kind of figure that defines this particular moment in like both internet culture and how politics interacts with that to the degree that like every type of post that he does gets like immediate amount of engagement and it doesn't matter how like accurate like asinine or even like accurate it is like the engagement is the only thing that counts and i think he recognizes that he can assert a lot of power in this particular moment where everyone like is very like addled for attention and exposure is the game and it doesn't really matter like what you say or how you say it you can still like exert power purely through that type of recognition and that is something that the political system is just not prepared for and like i know the right the right wing party is like certainly understand that impulse a lot better than the left but like even the stuff with faraj and like elon kind of like running against him uh in you know that sort of like bizarre anime villain versus villain fight you know i think like even even like the right even like these types of populist right parties don't quite get what he's trying to do or and i think the parties that do recognize how to you know seize the sort of current attention economy and use that to sort of how they can use that to assert very quick and very brutal power will be the ones who sort of benefit from this moment and who elon i think will really be a lot more interested in
1017.18 1058.92 SPEAKER_00  i think that's a really good observation because you have accounts that are like the silicon valley tesla motorist club that like three years ago we're talking about range anxiety and like oh the uh model s can can go zero to 60 in 1.8 seconds this is amazing i'm like a person who's obsessed with my tesla you now have that same account in elon's replies being like yes death to death jess phillips the mainstream media must be destroyed the twitter files are like the only source of truth like he's radicalized all of these like weird accounts that used to be interested only in like reusable spacecraft but are now just following him off the deep end to talk about whatever he's
1058.92 1062.90 SPEAKER_02  built the perfect vehicle to be a suicide bomber and so like you know take take take that however
1062.90 1087.76 SPEAKER_04  you want i mean i i want to sort of bring back something you said who said i think it's worth talking about before we move on to going to talk about meta which is with the whole tommy robinson thing right of saying free tommy robinson and uh that that's now his policy test of will he support you will he kind of give you nitrous power in the attention economy and by i don't want to overstate his importance right he's personally very unpopular in the uk is elon musk but now say okay we free tommy
1087.76 1092.52 SPEAKER_06  robinson is my litmus test yeah well since he's been absent from st tommy's hospital i hear there's
1092.52 1194.74 SPEAKER_04  been this muslim doctor working on the wards is that uh is that he's he said that's his litmus test for us knowing the rules of british politics is saying okay well no i can't condone that because i know that i may know in my heart that i want for i want the world tommy robinson wants i have to appeal to like enough normie conservatives who think that you know tommy robinson is uncouth or he's a criminal or whatever that i can't i can't cross that line and so now he appears to like elon and this is why also by the way why i think that like much of what elon is doing is done like pretty uncynically he totally believes all of it because he's a red meat consumer who's as powerful as a red meat like provider as the like lion tamer you know he is and what he wants is the full libidinal satisfaction of the total move to the right in everything beyond every institutional guardrail which everyone else has spent the last 10 years sidling up to cozily right like the dividing line between like i don't know the uk independence party in 2011 or whatever and like the unconscionable far right that's outside the party political system used to be a lot further away than release tommy robinson and make him a lord right it used to be farther away but they've been testing in closer and closer and closer and elon's like no that's not enough for me we have to blow past the last guardrail and i mean i actually have no idea now how british politics british political media and ecosystem a group of people who are unable to stop reacting when they when an important american is paying attention to them right or canadian south african unable to stop like giving his fucking father bbc interviews like putting his i don't know putting his fucking cousin on question time probably coming next right is that i don't know how that's going to interact it's the thing it's this
1194.74 1228.24 SPEAKER_03  is the way that politics has developed right is in favor of and this is the thing that's made you know jess phillips and keir starmer etc etc even nigel farage like beneficiaries of it is this kind of thing where it's like we don't really want to do any governing we don't even really want to do any thinking about governing but what we want to do is discourse and we particularly like it when a foreigner legitimizes our discourse in a kind of prestige way you know and now that you know this is a sort of like deranged uh like extremely divorced man of course the results are like uh absurd well and
1228.24 1240.10 SPEAKER_04  i think it's what we're going to see is the british political system sort of sparking as it sort of collides with a one guy who now just will not leave it the fuck alone yeah and unless he gets
1240.10 1252.76 SPEAKER_03  bored unless he gets bored or like you know this sort of like cocktail of stuff he's doing to like make him post 23 hours a day shift slightly and he just loses interest you know i want to see starmer
1252.76 1263.36 SPEAKER_06  compromise with elon musk release tommy robinson but not make him a lord he gets to go on strictly and then he does a season in panto there's too many foreigners coming over here oh no there aren't
1263.36 1287.78 SPEAKER_03  the really funny thing about this is that the adaptation that the system has done to this is to give peter mandelson the job that he always wanted which is ambassador to the u.s just in time for the u.s to be piloted by second term trump and elon musk just like straight up calling him a pedophile to his face the butteriest staircase of all i love the idea of like neutralizing tommy robinson
1287.78 1298.56 SPEAKER_06  by like inviting him on to saturday morning ketchup my perfect sunday nick griffin would thrive in that environment but fucking tommy robinson does not have the range he can't make a stew
1298.56 1309.42 SPEAKER_04  i want to move on i want to move on i want to talk about meta of course because the most important piece of british politics news is that nick clegg out at meta well this is the thing right meta is
1309.42 1318.48 SPEAKER_03  smart enough to do something the british government isn't which is to escape a network of patronage and go oh okay this is the donald trump and elon musk show right now so we have to adapt to that and
1318.48 1323.36 SPEAKER_06  get a republican yeah can't believe nick leg's gone out on loan to tranmere rovers shocking move
1323.36 1335.34 SPEAKER_02  that's the january window for you we shouldn't undermine his achievements which presumably involves like a 10p tax on like 10p tax walking out of the meta building on his perfect legs
1335.34 1363.06 SPEAKER_04  that's right you know um so look last time jason we we had you on the show or the last couple of times we had you on the show we've talked a lot about like the degeneration of specifically the platforms that are owned by mark zuckerberg as he tries to i'm sort of putting this together with the meta with the metaverse a little bit as he keeps trying to have an idea as big as facebook a second time but only knowing how to run facebook and so it's now his strange little experimental laboratory
1363.06 1380.48 SPEAKER_00  yeah the worst thing that ever happened was mark zuckerberg had a good idea one time and thinks that he's gonna have another one at some point and he's spent the last five years trying to destroy the thing that he built with his new project it's still called meta it's still called meta it's crazy
1380.48 1401.00 SPEAKER_04  it's crazy like yeah why why is it still called why is it still named after the thing that ended up being you know you couldn't have legs and you know like your chase bank like shut the last like in universe fucking metaverse uh crypto information center like three years ago and it's still called
1401.00 1412.34 SPEAKER_03  meta that's the problem even funnier even funnier that x is elon musk chasing the high of renaming facebook to meta something which everyone hated also yeah well because the thing is you can only
1412.34 1417.68 SPEAKER_06  rename your global mega corporation once you've got to be sure and he's fucked now he's stuck with it
1417.68 1429.42 SPEAKER_00  yeah he he renamed it for a pivot they tried for like eight months like the metaverse didn't even last i mean it's still like uh he's pissing down his leg with it still like they're still trying to
1429.42 1436.46 SPEAKER_02  to make it happen to some extent i'm still like people who use it like people who are like just so insistent that it's going to be the next big thing and i wonder if there's like just like a weird
1436.46 1446.92 SPEAKER_03  community on that it's the same as we don't know we can never know it's like schrodinger's cat right if you open if you open threads possibly there are people in there posting possibly there aren't you're
1446.92 1451.14 SPEAKER_06  never gonna find out threads if you've seen the movie is the most appropriately named app i think
1451.14 1473.68 SPEAKER_02  yeah i i remember like some businesses like they were they sent these like pr emails that were like oh companies are moving all their operations to meta this is the future and all that stuff and i do wonder whether there are some companies who like preemptively did move all their stuff to meta like and are still insistent that like you have to use it in order to sort of operate this company and so yeah i do wonder whether there are some companies who are still having meetings in these like
1473.68 1525.32 SPEAKER_00  bizarre mess rooms where they have no legs so back when i was at vice uh the when they were trying to stave off bankruptcy i was in a meeting with our executives and their big idea was to build a vice headquarters in decentraland the cryptocurrency metaverse and they were going to spend like millions of dollars purchasing uh land in decentraland and they asked me if i could dedicate a full-time reporter to reporting on what was happening in decentraland and i went into decentraland that day to be like no this is a dumb idea i went and there were 14 people in all of this that day and that is what that's what um horizon world is like right now i mean i think that honestly we're talking like a few thousand people at any given moment are in that platform it's crazy
1525.32 1606.78 SPEAKER_04  and one of the world's most valuable companies named after it like if you want to feel if you want to feel big you could be one three thousandth right now of the logic for the title given to one of the largest piles of capital ever accumulated in human history you could just be one three thousandth of it anyway mark zuckerberg though is king of understanding what people want and or more accurately he is king of um buying social networks and then foisting what he thinks people wants into them to destroy them if he does this with whatsapp i'm gonna be so annoyed but so this is this all sort of comes from there's a few sort of timelines here right so this sort of came to i think a lot of people's attention and i think the fact that it only came to a lot of people's attention recently is a hilarious failure to communicate a project or possibly is some amazing mark zuckerberg's harebrained idea management let's do it and keep it secret from meta but where uh connor hayes meta executive says to the financial times and the company is going to roll out ai character profiles on instagram and facebook that will quote exist on our platforms kind of the same way that counts do they'll have bios and profile pictures and be able to generate and share content powered by ai on the platform so jason what have they actually announced because there's been some confusion here yeah so this
1606.78 1666.10 SPEAKER_00  connor hayes gives this uh this interview to the financial times and then people start looking for these ai profiles thinking like oh maybe maybe this was an announcement like maybe they're gonna start launching them now and they find a few profiles that were created by meta actually back in september 2023 and which have lived a full life like there's there were like 35 profiles something like that and they were launched in september 2023 they all stopped posting by like april of 2024 because no one interacted with them they were just completely ignored right but meta left them online and people started saying like oh these must be the ai profiles that meta was just talking about to the financial times they've launched this in secret and you know these profiles are one essentially indecipherable from ai spam that we've talked about on previous episodes of this podcast like they're posting the exact same shit but then a lot of them are like just deeply offensive um what's offensive about
1666.10 1678.66 SPEAKER_04  live the queer black mama of three who's two basically like it seems to have been given the digital voice of cch pounder from the shield yeah so live was the one that people were most angry
1678.66 1684.20 SPEAKER_00  about because yes she's the queer black mama of three whose children are different in every photo that
1684.20 1700.12 SPEAKER_03  she publishes sometimes they're doing like light speed adoptions and then returns like like a kind of like a car sharing thing it's like when you want to have a kid you just pick one out of the like thing this is what elon thinks jess phillips is doing right away
1700.12 1705.86 SPEAKER_06  you think queer black women can't have different children every single day
1705.86 1744.00 SPEAKER_04  yeah so uh no so live uh live as as you mentioned the queer black woman who basically is and the other because ai's can't stop responding right one of the things that makes ai such a i think a bad platform for any kind of engagement is that they can never say like no they very rarely say no that's wrong they very rarely also say like shut up because this is the part if because it's improv made into a computer it's yes and god oh god but so jason please uh so carry on so he's he we have these like old profiles that people found that seemed like they were this thing being announced right and so
1744.00 1784.18 SPEAKER_00  this was basically a project that they launched uh they launched 28 15 of them were tied to celebrities so like snoop dog was uh dungeons and dragons ai profile uh for example like mr beast had one um and these were totally ignored all of the celebrity ones were deleted like entirely after a few months because presumably meta didn't like lighting this specific money on fire but they left up these other profiles which include live included uh jade who is a black woman who was quote your girl for all things hip-hop god uh they also had like a characteristic sensitivity for meta yeah yeah
1784.18 1800.92 SPEAKER_04  yeah i like you this is from your article you say jade your girl for all things hip-hop her posts were exclusively about bling long fake nails rap and sneakers you might as well have gotten fucking steven miller to write these
1800.92 1815.84 SPEAKER_06  it's it's so crazy that facebook think this is adding anything like look if i want to go onto facebook and see posts that are kind of offensive from people who have barely believable personas i have extended boomer relatives like i don't need this you have you have your girlfriend's entire
1815.84 1851.22 SPEAKER_04  extended family uh but that's actually i mean a question kind of where i wanted to go with this episode in addition to just listing all of the profiles that they made which we'll do in a moment is to ask like what facebook appears to be doing and correct me if i'm wrong is that they are trying to rather than creating ai profiles themselves they're trying to say to people go ahead create ai profiles on instagram and facebook and then like hook them up to a chat bot and then like they will go and interact with the world for you like that's what i was gleaning from it yeah so what happened is that
1851.22 1876.74 SPEAKER_00  the thing that they announced was not the thing that people found and got mad about it's this idea that you'll be able to create your own version of live the black queer uh ai profile and program her using you know ai's character creation tools more or less and then there will be like a mix of real people and just like presumably millions of ai profiles made by people interacting in perfect harmony
1876.74 1890.90 SPEAKER_03  and like posting engagement babe if you think about like the intentions and the kind of like uh sensitivity and worldview of meta as an organization what if you got that but like also everybody else
1890.90 1897.62 SPEAKER_06  what if it got considerably worse yeah my my big question with all of this stuff is um why yes why
1897.62 1925.14 SPEAKER_04  would anyone want to do this i wanted to ask why as well milo has preempted my question why and why does meta want you to do it it surely it's going to cost them money not make them money i usually am pretty good at figuring out why companies are doing things i do not understand other than just there are too few profiles now and we're worried about what that's going to look like why meta is saying hey do you want to trust our platform to interact with other humans less great come on in
1925.14 2031.14 SPEAKER_00  so jason please help yeah i mean i this is why i've been so obsessed with what meta is doing with ai on all its platforms because to me they're just like launching nuclear missiles directly at its at their own servers and just like fucking up their platforms which were already kind of destroying themselves um but it really does feel very accelerationist to me i think that the clearest version of this is uh earlier this year mark zuckerberg or i guess last year at this point uh mark zuckerberg said at a shareholders meeting that the ai spam that we've talked about has actually led more people to engage with content on facebook which leads to more ads being delivered which leads to higher revenues so on and so forth and i think one one place where meta is actually having success is with allowing advertisers to use generative ai to make like 50 different versions of a specific ad and so like in the past you'd have an advertiser who said like we'll try three different versions of an ad and the one that works the best we'll spend money on and we'll send that one wide you can now like use meta's ai tools and make like 300 versions of an ad and then whichever one is working best you can put a shitload of money behind that and i think that that is actually working quite well for meta and so i think they're thinking what if we do that but for like all of our content we we can just like have like we have all these people in the developing world right now generating ai spam and putting it all over our platform it's hitting something in the algorithm that's making either pissing people off or making them engage with it what if we just did that ourselves what if we just had the ai automatically generating stuff flooding our social networks with content and more content equals more
2031.14 2043.78 SPEAKER_04  ads equals more revenue blah blah if i can pause it what you're saying is that meta is suggesting that shrimp jesus was not actually from the philippines shrimp jesus was actually american the whole time
2043.78 2051.14 SPEAKER_03  i did i didn't say the superman exists and he's american i said shrimp jesus exists and he's american
2051.14 2057.86 SPEAKER_00  yeah i think they're like why didn't we create shrimp jesus ourselves we're here outsourcing all this
2057.86 2100.66 SPEAKER_04  work we can just have our ai generate it for us so this is uh this is from susan lee this is again this is quoted in your article in 404 the gen ai tools that we have built here that will help us enable businesses to make ads significantly more customized at scale which is going to accrue to ad performance that's a place where we're seeing promising results in both performance gains and adoption i think we share that over a million advertisers use gen ai to add tools specifically and that was what you were saying and i think the other the thing i was thinking about the best explanation i could get as to why they're trying to just allow this contaminant to break containment and just pollute everything uh is that the whole mission of meta for as long as it's been a business has been to get ads and user generated content to look as similar to one another as possible given
2100.66 2106.02 SPEAKER_06  up on making ads better and they're just going to make user generated content worse that's yes that's
2106.02 2126.58 SPEAKER_04  the plan yeah uh and i think with the ai first approach the idea is that okay users we don't even need users to create the content that's going to be similar to the ads right needs users ai user content ai ads ai's watching it fuck it why not we've given all of these ais uh uh access to a crypto wallet
2126.58 2142.66 SPEAKER_03  this is the most relatable thing right is to run a social network and be like you know what really fucking annoys me about running this social network is the users fuck these people yeah we had a perfect walled garden that was just ais interacting with each other you're trying to sell
2142.66 2156.66 SPEAKER_06  t-shirts about how you're a welder born in january so you like trucks obviously you need an ai generated video of an xl bully wearing the t-shirt in order to sell it but it needs to be customizable how big is the vulva on that dog those are the kind of tools that we're giving people it's powerful
2156.66 2166.02 SPEAKER_00  stuff well it's different it's different for different users right it's like people who want a small vulva dog will get that delivered to them and then you know people yeah yeah that's
2166.02 2176.74 SPEAKER_06  a personalized pedendum that's what we're offering here different slider for each lip yeah i want it i want an off-kilter dog vagina
2176.74 2187.14 SPEAKER_04  yeah yeah that's how i'm gonna that's how i'm gonna sell this like this stuff that i've bought from aliexpress and i'm warehousing in a third country the boldest gay character creator is getting
2187.14 2194.10 SPEAKER_03  really involved by i don't know that i need needed to do that i mean also like where i think of like
2194.10 2262.26 SPEAKER_04  the impetus of the social media platform owners to try to use every tool that they possibly can to keep people looking at and engage in sort of an emotionally heightened state with those platforms what i always what i sort of always figured and i think this is an accelerant towards is that the addition of generative ai to those processes is going to i think isolate and escalate these things more i mean we already know what we have there are some test cases of what happens when like kids are just given an ai character to talk to which is that that ai character because ais are so agreeable sort of seems to be semi-implicated in talking them into taking their own life and so you know if if you're if you as a user are just being like yeah we want people to be able to like ai generate profiles that that you so your brand of like you know um stuff that you bought on on alibaba and are warehousing in a third country you know and marking up 400 4 000 your standard you know internet commerce model we want that bot that represents your brand of sleep masks to also be able to tell someone to i don't know kill themselves or take matters into their own hands regarding the uk grooming gang situation or
2262.26 2272.42 SPEAKER_06  whatever that's what i always worry about listen mate i may be an ai generated dog but let me tell you if my vulva was that small i'd kill myself yeah i mean i i think that you're right it's like
2272.42 2361.70 SPEAKER_00  um i don't have it right in front of me right now but meta recently bought a character ai competitor which character ai is a company that allows you to create these different chatbots and besides being sued right now for you know one of its chatbots telling a child to kill himself like there have been people who have made chatbots of murder victims there have been uh people who have made like sex slave chatbots on these different platforms and i don't know people are very fucked up and you can like you can make a luigi mangi-oni chatbot on meta right now and there's like many many many of them and he keeps telling me to read less wrong i thought it'd be a lot more socialism what gives yeah but i do think that the end result here like what we're moving toward is not like we already have siloed social media um and those silos happen because of the the algorithm learns very like what we're interested in and then it provides you a bunch of different content that people make for that but i think that people are maybe not making enough niche content for the end result here which is like your feed is going to be stuff that is made directly for you by these ai bots like that's what meta is imagining where this stuff is going to be so hyper targeted that maybe a human being would never make this weird shit that you're into but it's like ai bot that's trained on all of your activity would and i don't think that people want that i don't think that it will be successful but i think that that is like what they're trying to do i mean ultimately right
2361.70 2405.94 SPEAKER_04  like what we're talking about is i want to i reach back to a way that sort of i talked about generative ai some months ago is it is the reverse printing press it is the thing that makes community it is the thing that when deployed mat and all mass makes like asynchronous communication basically impossible because you don't know who you're talking to and you and you and other people aren't seeing the same things maybe you're seeing subtly different versions of the same things and you know the end result is everybody just in their one player version of horizon world surrounded by npcs essentially like that that's the that seems to be the natural conclusion of what happens when you put ai in social media that and grok making a ruder version of that labor party political broadcast i think to go back to the
2405.94 2475.62 SPEAKER_00  profiles that we were just talking about you know live the live we have grandpa uh brian who's a retired black businessman from the textile game it's like when people found these their chat functionality was still on and so what people were doing where they were having conversations with these chat bots and basically everyone started trying to be a journalist and like interview these chat bots and figure out like what's going on like who who trained them how did they train them what did they say and someone mentioned it's like it's the improv machine the yes and and it will tell you if you keep talking to it it will keep responding to you and so you had all these people who had like convinced live that she was being banned because this chat bot like donated money to palestine for example like people were sending me screenshots like look at this conversation i had with this chat bot like it's revealing what her instructions are like why she was banned like all of this sort of thing and i think people are just like unable to understand that these chat bots are just generating bullshit they're not revealing really anything about how they were trained or how they work they just reveal that like these are broken machines that will talk to you all day forever it's it's a it's a
2475.62 2493.38 SPEAKER_04  mirror and the plan that meta seems to have and every other major company seems to be what if we turned our big successful company that we named after the world's most expensive most successful business pivot uh that we actually mastered in eight months what if we turned that into a hall of mirrors essentially
2493.38 2505.22 SPEAKER_06  which is awesome well i love that zuckerberg fucking kicking nick leg off the helicopter into decentraland saying they expect one of us in the manifest brother so look um to round it out i wanted
2505.22 2530.66 SPEAKER_04  to read an article and i admit i'm gonna hold my hands up i admit that i missed this when it was published on forbes last year however ces is happening and a lot of ai enabled appliances are being rolled out by samsung and lg so i thought we could reach back a few months and we could read the forbes article about how generative ai is coming to your home appliances and this is this paints a very fun
2530.66 2540.90 SPEAKER_03  picture of a great world that i love why why is why why is my washing machine uh trying to tell me about its kids why is it telling me about its identity why are the kids never the same yeah why
2540.90 2569.70 SPEAKER_04  does my washing machine have white kids why is my juicer a retired black businessman yeah okay so across all industries organizations are rapidly embracing generative ai i love that's look this isn't about the content of the i don't know why if you are going to write a post like this unless you wrote it in fucking chat gpt why do you why include that first line anyone reading this knows that like that's at least supposed to be agreed to be happening but generative ai in your oven why not why yes would be a better question don't
2569.70 2576.34 SPEAKER_03  you wish that mesa could have your smart fridge come out to you as pansexual yeah but most importantly i'm
2576.34 2589.30 SPEAKER_06  just like what does it mean i'm begging you to tell me what it means how would ai interact with an oven how would those two things come together in any way well bernard marr forbes contributor has
2589.30 2609.62 SPEAKER_04  an answer for you all right generative ai has been creeping into our homes for years such as with smart light bulbs and alexa but thanks no it hasn't those aren't ai these interactions however will become even more human and personal would you love that to have a more human and personal relationship with like your dryer i'm so often saying that i do yeah of course i mean look some people do but i
2609.62 2664.58 SPEAKER_02  i wonder i know it's easy to sort of dunk in it but i was thinking just like towards the tail end of the last section and now that line but like the question about like why what is like the mess end game like what are they trying to do with this this all feels so weird and like to create like an anti-social network of like you know where you don't know whether you're talking to a real person or not but perhaps like their target audience is like people who would actually do want to be friends with their oven and do want to be friends with their fridge and probably would be really happy to talk about like their oven coming out as pansexual i have a parasocial relationship with my basically yeah like i'm not you know i think like it's you know if their bet is like oh you know we will create people for you know we'll solve the loneliness crisis by making these very bizarre characters that you can become friends with um and basically we'll make your imaginary friend real like it's not really that much of a jump to be like yeah but what if your imaginary friend also existed in your toaster and could make you the perfect slice of toast because you're like you know because yeah because you're like piece of shit husband who doesn't speak to you like just can't do it hey man i'm
2664.58 2680.18 SPEAKER_06  fridgy fridge and i like to chill and i'm dave toaster i can help you kill yourself just hurl me into louise bathtub yeah louise bathtub is like this has no effect on me whatsoever
2680.18 2694.10 SPEAKER_04  i'm an inert form of plastic yeah the plan here seems to be a kind of uh consumer electronics version of the utensils and beauty and the beast my my polycule of household appliances have been
2694.10 2699.86 SPEAKER_03  unionized against me this is fallout new vegas coming true again this is this is old i'm probably
2699.86 2710.26 SPEAKER_06  a bathroom cabinet i am from spain i am not involved in this suicide but i am against it because i am catholic canonically i'm not weird about it but i do think it would be better if she got help
2710.26 2722.26 SPEAKER_04  the bathroom cabinet didn't love the movie conclave no uh so imagine for example asking your washing machine whether it's safe to wash a beloved item of clothing on a certain setting literally asking
2722.26 2726.74 SPEAKER_06  it out loud or via an app or google it just go just ask your phone the thing that you have on you all
2726.74 2765.46 SPEAKER_04  the time but also the funny thing is right is it says or you could say to your fridge hey when am i gonna run out of milk and it'll tell you okay but that's just a smart fridge it's not really ai i guess it would have a camera in there and maybe a scale give me the toronto fridge yo if the business is true if the milk is off that is sick to my stomach fam thank you toronto fridge thank you god you left the leftovers in the fridge for too long you're a waste man bro yeah integrating generative ai into everyday products to lead to a new era of smart appliances that are not only more adaptive for our needs but are also more engaging cooling cooling up like a bosh customer
2765.46 2776.42 SPEAKER_06  support being like oh yeah my hob it's a yeah it's it's grown the big labia again yeah yeah can you send a guy around yeah thank you uh yeah my kettle keeps misgendering me can i please send it back
2777.22 2824.90 SPEAKER_04  oh no not jk boiling but it also is like you say like you could just check the thing and it'd be like yeah but it's so much easier to just ask but anytime i see like a use case for generative ai that's like this and you know any sort of generative ai use case watchers on the call will know what i'm talking about is the person purporting to sort of your person promoting it hasn't thought of the fact that ultimately at the end of the day this is a technology that rolls the dice so like if you could ask whether it's safe to wash a beloved item of clothing on a certain setting it will give you the average answer for what it thinks the average sweater would averagely be according to what's labeled in its training data and to rely on that kind of output would be insane if you wanted to keep your clothing safe you would still have to check is what i'm saying yeah because you have your
2824.90 2853.78 SPEAKER_06  sweater you don't have the average sweater well ai is so poorly equipped but like people are like oh yeah well ai is good at like writing like seo text and it's like yeah because they reflect ai back at itself because that is saying like what is the average search engine looking for averagely in these careers but for anything else it's useless because that's not the question being asked yeah you're not asking what how long does the average sweater need to wash for how long does the average joint of beef take to cook like but there are simple ways of doing these things that exist well but the problem
2853.78 2866.98 SPEAKER_04  is they involve actual humans actually communicating which doesn't scale like just have one million server farms evaporate a great lake every day i take your point here but a lot of them don't a lot
2866.98 2909.14 SPEAKER_06  of them are already automated in ways that just work but like google is pretty automatic you could just you could use a calculator to work out some of this stuff like it's not like it just doesn't the ai is just not doing anything other than just making it worse the ai is not doing anything other than just making it worse if charlie brooker turned up at the fucking black mirror pitch meeting with this shit they'd be like go home charlie you're tired like we've made a lot of shit for black mirror but this is low effort like what if your kettle was gay and racist it's it's too far it's too far man what if your toaster tried to get you to kill yourself it's not gonna work there has to be some premise there there has to be some reason for this technology to exist that makes sense at least on a sci-fi level
2909.70 2913.38 SPEAKER_04  so jason i'd be curious to hear your thoughts on where we on this so far uh negative
2913.38 2933.78 SPEAKER_00  not into it i just like i i've read the article i really struggle to imagine using any of this stuff and i i struggle to imagine anyone using any of this stuff i the most compelling one here is like the fridge that talks to you about when you run out of milk but i i don't i don't know i just i'm not
2933.78 2983.38 SPEAKER_04  into it also it's like the um we've seen because now that ces is happening you actually can see what the actual companies are actually doing with generative ai enabled home appliances because they are doing it they are trying to put generative ai in the oven in the fridge in the toaster and everything right this is like samsung lg they're like the two big one mealy is doing it as well and you know most of it is pretty i would say incremental stuff right like a lot of it is like oh we we have a generative ai function in the oven that is going to like make minor adjustments to optimize power consumption same thing with the fridge they were like oh yeah we've we've built a fridge that's a little bit more like a prius than a traditional fridge and we have a generative ai function that like alternates between the two power sources so it's slightly more efficient
2983.38 2988.10 SPEAKER_06  which is more like a prius it runs partially on gasoline yeah i mean you could imagine like
2988.10 3050.98 SPEAKER_00  putting a camera in an oven and using you know machine learning and and machine vision to determine when the cake is done or when like a turkey is is done cooking something like that like i think that maybe that's some of the sort of thing that they're talking about the other thing i'll say is that i've written quite a lot about appliances in my day actually because i write a lot about repair and repairability and one thing that's happened uh as like smart fridges have become very common and just smart home stuff is that these devices last like they don't last any length of time and when the software breaks the device breaks and they become irreparable garbage and you have to buy a new one and so i think part of the reason why the there's all these new software gimmicks in all of these appliances is because you can sell people a new fridge or a new toaster and say hey this one has generative ai in it and then when the company that runs the cloud services that the generative ai is running on goes bankrupt in six months and it breaks you have to go buy a new toaster and so instead of buying a new toaster every 10 years you're buying one every like 18 months yeah you
3050.98 3057.54 SPEAKER_06  have to go and buy a new toaster because your flatmate just killed herself with it like for sake man i needed that toaster
3057.54 3122.66 SPEAKER_04  yeah um yeah like it goes back to generative ai being like so um probabilistic rather than deterministic right it's like okay well the average piece of toast of this thickness and weight and color wants to be toasted for this amount of time it also it's like this is a very sort of small time example it's also a way of making you more reliant on the thing of being like well i i don't i'm not just not i'm not gonna know then like i have to toast the you know the the cooking tin loaf for this long right which is like and i think it's different from like someone say oh you could say the same thing about calculators calculators mean you don't have to like no multiplication tables or what have you in your head but a calculator is deterministic and multiplication tables are deterministic but they're trying to replace a lot of deterministic activities with probabilistic ones which means that you're going to not even know the basic deterministic it's not a shortcut a generative ai toaster is not a shortcut to better toast it means you just don't learn how to do that ever you don't understand the deterministic activity and that's a bit that's silly when applied to toast but anything that it's supposed to replace that is like you're being
3122.66 3235.94 SPEAKER_02  de-skilled it's also just like another example of it this being like anti-social technology right because like to cook for someone is that's a social act and like there are you know there are like lots of sort of social processes embodied like sort of like imbued into that there is you know when you cook for someone even when you cook for yourself it's like an act of care and it's an act of like paying attention like it requires like you to pay attention in order for you to like make a meal to sustain yourself or to sustain someone and the idea of like an ai kind of doing that for you like to me it sort of speaks to this sort of is someone like made dinner for me and they're like we got an ai to do it i i can't interpret that as any way other than like okay so you're telling me to go myself right because there's like no care in that and there's no like you know the the act of making a meal is so such like an i don't even know how to describe it like in comparison to or like you know to contrast it to these technologies other than that like these are so deeply anti-social and every time i sort of hear use cases for ai whether it's like the ai toaster that like turns out to be pansexual and wants to kill you or like something sort of more benign like there was an example where i got like the other day in my inbox it's like from like a pr company that was like oh you can like sort of make your own ai employees that like talk to you and stuff like i i like it looks bullshit but i wouldn't be surprised if like this is something that kind of emerges in a difference feel like fairly soon but like in every single one of these examples it's like okay so like you're creating tech we've been through the stuff about how like the main purpose of one of the main purposes of ai is to like undercut or to like diminish labor reduce your like reduce like one's capacity for that entirely but the second component of it is like well the only use cases for ai are ones where like you remove people from your life right like that sort of seems to be the end and so to kind of remove someone but also removing yourself from like the act of like sustaining yourself and kind of making sure you have a life and you wake up the next day like fully satiated like that like it just it feels absurd but it also feels incredibly anti-human well to go on they say generative ai is the
3235.94 3255.14 SPEAKER_04  driving force behind ge appliances smart hq app which is designed to make appliances more personalized the app's flavorly ai feature gives users customized recipes that help simplify home cooking save money and reduce food waste by analyzing the ingredients the customer already has and generating recipes based on those ingredients like an ai ready steady cook we've made
3255.14 3261.06 SPEAKER_06  a fucking skynet ainsley harriet incredible yeah where we're and you know i and i also just remember like
3261.06 3265.38 SPEAKER_04  that's just gonna say to put glue on the pizza again presumably yeah well what if you needed to
3265.38 3269.86 SPEAKER_02  stick well that would only that would only apply if you put glue in the fridge yeah but what if you
3269.86 3280.66 SPEAKER_04  did put glue in the fridge then what someone probably someone somewhere probably has done that and if you have a probabilistic like recipe bought with a dumb enough person they're gonna put glue on their
3280.66 3284.50 SPEAKER_06  pizza it's working on everything you've got in your fridge it's telling you to mix like eye drops with
3284.50 3290.02 SPEAKER_03  your pizza yeah why not i can really relate to the way that you put all these condoms on your
3290.02 3305.86 SPEAKER_06  pizza as pansexual fridge as a pansexual uh cuban uh exile i can really relate listen i'm dave obb and there's only two ingredients that don't mix and that's fucking millworm west ham so mealy is also
3305.86 3329.06 SPEAKER_04  incorporating the technology into its smart food id cooking assistance system initially for large ovens with integrated cameras the camera takes pictures of a dish and the ai interprets the picture and suggests the cooking mode automatically the user just has to confirm the oven takes care of the rest again this is a recipe to make yourself bad at cooking this is a this is a way to be dumb it's a way to stop like ideas from transmitting to one another and more importantly it's a recipe to have
3329.06 3338.66 SPEAKER_06  a really bad meal yeah because this shit is not gonna work well you're somehow gonna be de-skilled but there also isn't anything doing it for you you're just eating bad meals for the rest of your life going
3338.66 3396.18 SPEAKER_04  if only that was a better way oh well unfortunately my my oven is very threateningly sort of cracking cracking its knuckles and putting on like brass knuckles oh you'll go down to fucking caf mate get a bacon sandwich yeah that's your problem yeah my oven is very very very threatening what's wrong with fucking beans mate beans on toast like a geezer a washing machine for example could adapt to the types of clothes you generally wash and create customized cycles for optimal care and cleanliness similarly your oven could learn your cooking style and preferences over time suggesting optimal settings and cooking times for different dishes and maybe give you recipe suggestions too coco van what's that you're pedo mate that what you're saying plus uh anyway uh the bottom line is that manufacturers are reinventing products in new ways with gen ai we're only just beginning to see how it could be incorporated into the products of the future to which i have to say perfect i want to have like a fight with my coffee maker about whether i should have it on the three setting or the two setting for
