0.00 17.32 SPEAKER_04  Hello everyone and welcome to a day that will live in infamy.
18.00 19.40 SPEAKER_04  What, another one?
19.60 21.04 SPEAKER_00  The XL Bully is now banned.
21.46 24.62 SPEAKER_00  Offer not valid for listeners in Scotland.
24.62 31.42 SPEAKER_00  We are getting all of the displaced XL Bully refugees.
32.08 33.78 SPEAKER_00  They're being driven over the border.
33.90 40.08 SPEAKER_00  There was one guy who drove a van with 33 XL Bullies over the border.
40.26 41.68 SPEAKER_00  Presumably got to Gretna.
41.80 42.76 SPEAKER_00  Did a handbrake turn.
42.76 44.40 SPEAKER_00  You know it smell crazy in there.
45.54 47.16 SPEAKER_06  You got one of those commercials.
47.28 51.66 SPEAKER_06  The old commercials they had with the arms of the angels just playing in the background.
51.66 58.60 SPEAKER_06  Wow, the XL Bullies are like mauling a child in black and white in slow motion.
61.44 65.34 SPEAKER_03  There have literally been XL Bully videos set to arms of the angels.
65.48 67.30 SPEAKER_03  I have seen that in real life in the wild.
67.30 72.66 SPEAKER_00  So what I presume is going to happen is you get your van with the like 33 XL Bullies.
72.66 76.88 SPEAKER_00  You drive it up to Scotland.
77.10 78.96 SPEAKER_00  You get to the big welcome to Scotland sign.
79.06 80.56 SPEAKER_00  You do a perfect handbrake turn.
80.96 82.08 SPEAKER_00  Slide the door open.
82.36 85.60 SPEAKER_00  And you just like deposit them northwards over the border.
85.78 86.66 SPEAKER_00  And then you call it good.
87.86 92.58 SPEAKER_04  Unrelatedly, child maulings in Perthshire are up a staggering 12,000%.
92.58 103.42 SPEAKER_00  This is the one time I will support like both Scottish independence and border security is we need a hard border between Scotland and England yesterday.
103.42 117.54 SPEAKER_04  What I find the most fun, of course, is the various, let's say almost like Lib Dem style protests being taken out by carried out by XL Bully partisans.
118.38 120.06 SPEAKER_04  So this is in the mirror.
120.58 128.52 SPEAKER_04  A dad staged a one man protest against new laws and XL Bullies by wearing a muzzle and drinking a pint through a straw at his local pub.
128.52 129.76 SPEAKER_04  He does it.
129.94 131.46 SPEAKER_00  It's political activism.
132.00 136.02 SPEAKER_00  And yet I am being asked to leave Weatherspoons again.
136.52 136.84 SPEAKER_00  Yes.
137.28 139.34 SPEAKER_00  You know, I seems crazy.
139.92 140.88 SPEAKER_06  I've always had the opinion.
141.02 143.14 SPEAKER_06  There's no bad dogs, only bad owners.
143.26 148.10 SPEAKER_06  But this is a style of dog which is only designed to appeal to bad owners.
148.90 149.46 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
150.02 152.06 SPEAKER_03  Well, yeah, this is literally the case.
152.12 154.38 SPEAKER_03  It is like the AR-15 of dogs.
154.38 154.74 SPEAKER_03  Yes.
155.28 162.16 SPEAKER_03  Everyone's having to back form an explanation why they bought the dog branded like Savage Killer X Busy or whatever.
162.74 164.74 SPEAKER_02  And be like, no, he's lovely.
164.86 166.00 SPEAKER_02  He's such a friendly dog.
166.10 167.96 SPEAKER_02  Look at his, look at his jowls.
168.08 169.18 SPEAKER_02  Look at his sharp fangs.
169.94 171.94 SPEAKER_03  He's a delightful little creature.
172.70 174.90 SPEAKER_03  It wouldn't hurt anyone who's bigger than him.
174.90 184.34 SPEAKER_04  Eamon Magritte and his six-month-old dog wore matching protective mouth guards during their visit to the Straw Hat pub.
185.22 188.24 SPEAKER_03  That makes it sound like they're wearing a gum shield.
188.58 190.80 SPEAKER_03  Like, you've got to be careful when you're playing hockey.
190.80 200.52 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, no, I kind of, depending, I'm going to do a variation of the same joke I did before and say that this guy is actually doing like emancipatory social action.
200.86 205.44 SPEAKER_00  Because he is making it normal to wear a muzzle in public.
205.68 207.92 SPEAKER_00  And for that, I think the trans community is going to thank him.
208.42 211.64 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, do you think there are no kink at the XL Bully March people?
212.34 214.94 SPEAKER_03  Like, they're like, we need to be taken seriously.
214.94 220.82 SPEAKER_00  The puppy play that you identify as an XL Bully is like, really, that's got legs, you know?
221.50 222.08 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
222.08 226.32 SPEAKER_01  You could be, you could sort of like piss everyone off by being like an XL Bully bottom.
227.68 229.52 SPEAKER_01  The power bully.
231.66 236.04 SPEAKER_04  MacReady's daughter, Elle, said he did this to make a point and it made her feel proud.
236.38 243.80 SPEAKER_04  She said, Dad was drinking pints using a straw through the muzzle and then getting on the floor with Lexi and playing the dog and playing around with her.
243.80 247.44 SPEAKER_03  Drinking through a straw like someone who's gotten on the wrong side of an XL Bully.
248.16 250.16 SPEAKER_06  That is, that is a kink thing.
250.42 251.30 SPEAKER_06  That is straight up a kink thing.
251.30 260.22 SPEAKER_00  As soon as you told me about the floor thing, I'm like, this is a man who had this kink already and saw an opportunity and seized it, you know?
261.82 270.88 SPEAKER_03  This reminds me of a riff we ended up going down because Annabelle's flatmate recently got confused when trying to talk about the Dulux dog.
270.88 275.30 SPEAKER_03  Like the dog that advertises Dulux paint and accidentally said the Durex dog.
276.24 279.20 SPEAKER_03  Like the dog that encourages you to have safe sex with your dog.
279.28 281.10 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, the Durex dog, huge hit of pride.
282.06 282.72 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, that's right.
282.80 291.18 SPEAKER_06  This is, this is the other thing that we have you Brits meet is that in America, in several states, I believe, drinking beer through a straw is illegal.
291.62 292.06 SPEAKER_06  Really?
292.56 292.76 SPEAKER_06  Yes.
292.76 293.10 SPEAKER_06  Really?
294.10 294.78 SPEAKER_06  Like, why?
295.06 295.98 SPEAKER_06  How do they enforce?
296.08 297.14 SPEAKER_06  I don't know why.
297.68 300.16 SPEAKER_06  No one would be insane enough to try it.
300.66 301.58 SPEAKER_06  We don't know what happens.
301.58 305.30 SPEAKER_01  I do find ones who did actually drink a pint, like went to a pub and did drink a pint with a straw.
305.82 306.02 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
306.10 308.16 SPEAKER_03  Was it like Boddington's or more of a light beer?
308.16 310.22 SPEAKER_01  I didn't really ask because I didn't really know.
310.30 312.06 SPEAKER_01  It wasn't really my thing, but he pulled up.
312.06 314.18 SPEAKER_03  The darker the beer, the weirder it is to drink through a straw.
314.18 317.46 SPEAKER_01  He had his own metal straw and he drank everything with that straw.
317.56 320.26 SPEAKER_01  And that's like fine if you're like, you're having like a fizzy drink or something.
320.26 321.02 SPEAKER_01  Like a robot.
321.22 322.40 SPEAKER_01  But it did feel a bit weird.
322.52 326.18 SPEAKER_01  I feel like, yeah, he got the pint and he put the straw in the pint.
326.64 326.90 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
327.18 328.46 SPEAKER_01  And he just drank it like it was.
328.52 334.00 SPEAKER_01  And it was, even to me, someone who doesn't go to pubs much and doesn't drink, that did feel a bit.
334.00 339.82 SPEAKER_01  But I would have, you know, very much supported his deportation.
339.82 345.68 SPEAKER_00  It genuinely like, it has a particular kind of like rancid vibe to drink beer through a straw.
345.98 347.76 SPEAKER_00  In the same way, there's something troubling about it.
347.76 355.14 SPEAKER_00  In the same way as like my other watermark for that, which is eating a birthday cake that you have bought not anywhere near your birthday.
356.74 357.50 SPEAKER_03  Oh yeah.
357.60 360.32 SPEAKER_03  Olga calls this the suitcase full of piss rule.
360.32 363.58 SPEAKER_03  Like it's not illegal per se, but we do have some questions.
363.76 364.02 SPEAKER_03  Anyway.
364.24 364.54 SPEAKER_03  Anyway.
364.76 367.24 SPEAKER_06  Or like eating a pizza backwards like Trump.
367.88 368.96 SPEAKER_05  Oh yeah.
368.96 369.16 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
369.16 369.88 SPEAKER_05  Frost first.
370.02 373.54 SPEAKER_04  I want to, I want to welcome everybody to the first bonus episode of the year.
373.72 375.20 SPEAKER_04  That was recorded this year.
376.08 386.90 SPEAKER_04  So we have everyone in effect today and we are being joined by Justin Rosniak of the Well There's Your Problem podcast, as well as Alice Caldwell-Kelly of the Well There's Your Problem podcast.
387.00 387.60 SPEAKER_04  What the fuck?
387.68 388.62 SPEAKER_04  Cool podcast.
389.00 390.10 SPEAKER_00  Nice to meet you, Alice.
390.10 390.34 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
390.50 390.74 SPEAKER_00  Likewise.
391.18 397.40 SPEAKER_00  It would be very funny to instrumentalize the name change here and be like two different hosts at the same time.
397.40 403.22 SPEAKER_06  It's like being on my own podcast, but there's extra people there and also Liam isn't here.
403.64 406.10 SPEAKER_03  Well, Liam's been sent to Scotland and muzzled.
408.32 409.32 SPEAKER_04  Weird honeymoon.
409.90 410.10 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
410.22 422.08 SPEAKER_04  We are talking, we have Justin here, of course, because I don't know if anyone will be able to believe this, but the Hyperloop is officially dead as a form of transport.
422.08 425.76 SPEAKER_00  And you have me here just to like fuck around, you know?
426.12 426.80 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, that's right.
427.04 431.66 SPEAKER_03  We could have used that to send all the XL bullies to Scotland at high speed.
431.78 435.54 SPEAKER_01  Elon Musk saw the Hamas tunnels and he was just like, I can't, I can't top this.
435.60 442.72 SPEAKER_00  Every XL bully has been loaded into the Hyperloop, which has compressed it to like all of them to a thin substrate.
442.72 445.92 SPEAKER_04  No, it's the most dangerous XL bully of all.
446.08 453.34 SPEAKER_04  It is an XL bully that is one nanometer wide and so is able to bisect a thousand children at once.
453.66 456.10 SPEAKER_06  I was about to say, you know, that's just like in an anime.
456.62 461.82 SPEAKER_06  It's like in an anime where the guy gets sliced in half and then slowly slides off.
462.96 465.92 SPEAKER_00  Doing the first scene of cube to bully XLs.
465.92 476.78 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, the only the, well, the problem is you put all the bully XLs in a cube, then only the two strongest remaining bully XLs will live and then they'll live as a breeding pair.
477.58 477.96 SPEAKER_04  No, no, no.
478.00 480.14 SPEAKER_04  We're talking about the Hyperloop.
480.70 482.92 SPEAKER_04  And we have a number of other things to talk about as well.
483.04 486.16 SPEAKER_04  But this is from the Times in 2017.
486.76 488.62 SPEAKER_04  This is a headline from the Times in 2017.
489.36 493.54 SPEAKER_04  Britain must wait for 700 mile per hour Hyperloop train.
493.54 497.14 SPEAKER_00  Britain must wait for like every train.
497.54 498.28 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, that's it.
498.34 505.52 SPEAKER_03  We have to wait for like the fucking 140 mile an hour train that we were supposed to get years ago and it was supposed to go from London to Manchester.
505.78 509.20 SPEAKER_03  But now it only goes from Birmingham to like Milton Keynes or whatever the fuck.
509.20 513.46 SPEAKER_00  You can do an even dumber guy level of analysis of this, which is, yeah, of course we have to wait for train.
513.56 515.34 SPEAKER_00  That's typically how they work.
515.88 521.60 SPEAKER_06  The whole premise of the Hyperloop, even if you believe the bullshit, was that it could be built really quickly.
522.00 523.30 SPEAKER_06  And in Britain, they're like, nah.
523.54 523.94 SPEAKER_04  Nah.
524.52 526.46 SPEAKER_04  So here's the article from 2017.
526.72 528.18 SPEAKER_04  Then we'll get into the details of what happened.
528.56 538.52 SPEAKER_04  A revolutionary 700 mile per hour train could have a transformative impact in the UK by cutting journey times between cities to well under an hour, according to government advisors.
538.90 541.48 SPEAKER_04  Well, I mean, the journey times between some cities are well under an hour.
541.56 542.48 SPEAKER_04  It just kind of depends.
542.78 551.90 SPEAKER_04  A paper published by the DFT yesterday said that the Hyperloop system should be considered in Britain because it will allow commuters to live anywhere within the country and easily commute great distances.
551.90 553.02 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
553.02 553.06 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
553.22 553.60 SPEAKER_00  Fuck it.
553.64 553.90 SPEAKER_00  Okay.
554.00 558.80 SPEAKER_00  Live in like zone 27, which is like northern Scotland and commute into central London.
559.06 559.24 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
559.24 560.44 SPEAKER_00  I actually live in a Falklands.
560.44 565.54 SPEAKER_03  We have the...
565.54 569.64 SPEAKER_03  Terry Peck commuting into his job in digital marketing in West London.
569.64 578.96 SPEAKER_04  The comments made by the DFT were made after it emerged that Sir Richard Branson was throwing his weight behind the technology by signing a deal with a company developing Hyperloop in the US.
579.52 580.02 SPEAKER_04  However, the...
580.02 581.30 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, the Necker Island Hyperloop.
581.34 588.52 SPEAKER_00  However, in a thing completely unrelated to Richard Branson, when are we going to talk about the Epstein list and people who are like implicated in that?
588.52 590.76 SPEAKER_00  Immediately after this.
591.40 593.74 SPEAKER_00  It's what he in the business call a segue.
594.90 595.86 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
596.80 599.58 SPEAKER_03  Alice was just thinking about Virgin and then...
599.58 607.94 SPEAKER_04  So, however, the paper acknowledged that Britain's shape, dense population and intensive land use may make Hyperloop construction more difficult and costly than in other locations.
608.66 609.16 SPEAKER_04  It said that...
609.16 611.58 SPEAKER_00  Dense and weirdly shaped, something I have in common with the whole country.
611.58 622.52 SPEAKER_04  It said that engineers may be forced to build a UK Hyperloop system entirely underground, which would have a significant effect on capital costs and make maintenance and emergency evacuation more difficult.
623.02 628.32 SPEAKER_04  I can't believe we almost were forced to build a UK Hyperloop system underground.
629.06 632.54 SPEAKER_04  As the frames as though, yeah, that's all we could possibly have done.
632.58 633.34 SPEAKER_04  It was that or nothing.
633.34 644.24 SPEAKER_03  It strikes me as like the difficult bit about building the Hyperloop is the kind of like hundreds of miles of vacuum sealed tunnel, not really whether or not the tunnel is above or below ground.
644.64 644.80 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
645.00 651.70 SPEAKER_06  I mean, the difficult bit is you are doing horizontal construction, which is always hard because land.
651.70 665.94 SPEAKER_04  So, what happened in more recently was that Richard Branson's Hyperloop one, which just keep this number in your mind, has raised more than 450 million since its foundation.
666.44 670.80 SPEAKER_04  And the only company that was actually like trying to do this commercially, it's out of business now.
671.22 679.08 SPEAKER_04  Also important to note, it wasn't Elon Musk's company, even though the Hyperloop was kind of Elon Musk's thing that he's been posting about since 2013.
679.08 691.64 SPEAKER_04  He did a sort of version of it within SpaceX, but SpaceX also has removed its Hyperloop tube, which had not been touched since 2019 when Musk held some competitions to build pods.
692.06 695.72 SPEAKER_04  It was dismantled at the request of the city of Austin, which had received complaints.
695.90 701.58 SPEAKER_04  I believe it was in Austin that received complaints that had become a nuisance because it took up a traffic lane and became an eyesore.
704.20 706.94 SPEAKER_03  They've gotten into like a neighbor dispute in Austin.
707.10 707.56 SPEAKER_03  That's fun.
707.56 725.20 SPEAKER_06  Although this started earlier than that, if I recall correctly, because when I was in college, which is a long time ago now, but not that long ago, you know, there was a Hyperloop team at Drexel, which actually wound up taking up valuable laboratory space from actual serious projects.
725.20 732.00 SPEAKER_06  It was like, you know, it was like, you know, it was like, you know, it was like, you know, all of a sudden it was like, we need to be that the forefront of Hyperloop technology.
732.54 737.74 SPEAKER_06  We're going to have our students design a fake Hyperloop pod for this fake Hyperloop thing.
738.20 740.50 SPEAKER_06  All sorts of universities started doing this.
741.00 743.94 SPEAKER_06  And this is the whole theme of the project.
743.94 748.68 SPEAKER_06  It's a distraction from actual serious work that needs to be done in transportation.
748.68 752.72 SPEAKER_00  It strikes me as like the infrastructure equivalent of the metaverse, right?
752.80 757.58 SPEAKER_00  Of this thing that kind of ended up going nowhere, but like was on trend for a bit.
757.66 760.14 SPEAKER_00  And so, like you say, just kind of like sucked up resources.
760.48 767.06 SPEAKER_00  Like there were a shitload of companies that had like entire metaverse teams that have now all been fired or moved on in the exact same way.
767.48 770.32 SPEAKER_00  And much like the metaverse, the Hyperloop just didn't have legs.
770.32 783.90 SPEAKER_04  Well, it's the, I would, I always remember about the, about something like the metaverse is that mostly the resources that it took up were except for obviously at like, you know, meta.
784.16 798.28 SPEAKER_04  But most of the resources it took up were from like JP Morgan's marketing department, which decided to maintain a branch in the metaverse where people could like, you know, float in and, you know, do some banking with crypto or what have you.
798.28 804.26 SPEAKER_04  Whereas, you know, Hyperloop was taking up resources from people who were doing actual stuff rather than, you know, marketing.
805.12 805.56 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
805.78 810.20 SPEAKER_03  But, you know, the metaverse did do a lot of damage to Nick Clegg's self-esteem and mental health.
810.40 812.36 SPEAKER_03  So, you know, who can say which is worse, really?
812.80 819.62 SPEAKER_06  All these people would be better employed working as navvies on the high speed rail system we need.
819.68 819.82 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
820.04 820.68 SPEAKER_00  Dig ditches.
820.86 821.80 SPEAKER_00  You know, this is the thing.
821.96 826.34 SPEAKER_00  When, when we enshrine you, Justin, as sort of like supreme leader, right?
826.34 829.38 SPEAKER_00  We're all sort of putting up big posters of you wearing like an arrow jacket.
829.74 829.98 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
830.42 833.92 SPEAKER_00  Then all of these people will be sent to work on the railways.
834.26 835.34 SPEAKER_06  Hey, this is the thing.
835.46 845.64 SPEAKER_06  I mean, it's going to, it's going to, there's going to be some sacrifices because I will also say all podcasters are going to have to take a shift, you know, three or four times a week.
845.90 846.72 SPEAKER_06  Digging ditches.
846.88 847.32 SPEAKER_02  I'm sorry.
847.32 848.12 SPEAKER_06  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
848.48 849.36 SPEAKER_03  Hang on.
849.50 849.92 SPEAKER_03  Hang on.
850.40 851.72 SPEAKER_03  Nick Clegg is fine.
851.72 860.34 SPEAKER_03  We can put Nick Clegg in a fucking flat cap, suspiciously high trousers and braces and have him talk in a weird Irish accent and he can be digging away at a ditch.
860.44 862.44 SPEAKER_03  But I draw the line at podcasters.
862.68 863.70 SPEAKER_00  We were essential workers.
864.08 869.48 SPEAKER_00  As labor aristocracy, we would be the sort of four men and women of, uh, of these crews.
869.76 875.64 SPEAKER_06  You're going to have to spend at least as much time podcasting as digging holes.
876.28 876.58 SPEAKER_06  Hmm.
876.58 879.14 SPEAKER_00  Which is probably about 45 minutes.
880.20 880.60 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
880.76 883.68 SPEAKER_00  Well, I know how long will that as your problem recordings go.
883.92 884.22 SPEAKER_00  So.
884.54 885.12 SPEAKER_00  Oh God.
885.64 886.88 SPEAKER_00  It's a hell of a big hole.
886.96 887.76 SPEAKER_00  You're digging over there.
887.96 891.80 SPEAKER_00  Just digging this sort of cola super deep borehole in the middle of a high speed rail line.
892.14 892.34 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
892.48 894.96 SPEAKER_04  Then we, some guys just come on, light it on fire.
895.06 896.62 SPEAKER_04  It stays on fire for half a century.
897.08 906.18 SPEAKER_04  Um, so, uh, with the whole hyperloop thing, the whole hyperloop thing, I think it's worth sort of reminding ourselves now that it has died.
906.18 921.08 SPEAKER_04  Um, sort of came about, it came about in, in 2013 in the public consciousness, uh, specifically to stop one particular stretch of high speed rail being built between LA and San Francisco.
921.40 930.34 SPEAKER_00  And then California, it turns out all of this infrastructure stuff, whether it's, whether it highways or whatever the fuck, for some reason, California is like the nexus of it.
930.34 951.84 SPEAKER_04  So what happened was Elon Musk, again, just a guy whose opinion is asked for, uh, in 2013, back when he still had at Sven very much on side, um, said, how could it be that the home of Silicon Valley and the jet propulsion laboratory doing incredible things like indexing all the world's knowledge and putting rovers on Mars would build a bullet train.
951.84 955.08 SPEAKER_04  That is one of the most expensive per mile and one of the slowest in the world.
955.08 966.10 SPEAKER_04  But doing the math, the hyperloop, which hyperloop one Branson's company, which built a quarter mile of track, um, is now clocking in at $1.8 billion per mile of track.
966.10 976.60 SPEAKER_06  And I would point out also that the California high speed rail, uh, what it, it, it, the design speed is 220 miles an hour, which makes it one of the fastest in the world.
976.60 982.28 SPEAKER_06  Not the fastest, but like in the top three doesn't matter.
982.40 982.96 SPEAKER_00  Not good enough.
983.08 987.38 SPEAKER_00  We have to have this impossible bullshit that like liquefies XL bullies.
987.68 988.12 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
988.16 990.70 SPEAKER_06  Well, you know, the idea was never to get the thing built.
990.70 995.82 SPEAKER_06  The idea was to, uh, you know, make people think, uh, this high speed rail stuff is nonsense.
995.82 998.60 SPEAKER_06  We could have a fake thing that doesn't work instead.
1000.80 1001.28 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1001.34 1002.08 SPEAKER_03  That's what they should do.
1002.14 1009.82 SPEAKER_03  They should give over the Austin hyperloop to the XL bullies, like let them create their own society and then solve two problems at a stretch.
1009.82 1016.96 SPEAKER_04  So when we, so the idea kind of, I don't know, let's say it has its Genesis and a kind of fit of peak in 2013.
1016.96 1026.50 SPEAKER_04  And then it ends up because Elon Musk is still credible at this point, which is, it seems sort of odd to think that this odd to remember.
1026.50 1037.30 SPEAKER_04  It seems a long time ago that there was a, there was a time when this guy could just kind of create a tweet that would spawn a mini and he would just tweet something that would spawn a mini industry.
1037.70 1040.88 SPEAKER_04  Uh, this obviously these times are now behind us.
1041.56 1047.30 SPEAKER_04  Um, but right then there is this profusion of interest in hyperloops after this.
1047.30 1052.98 SPEAKER_04  Um, there is, we actually know that, um, several were, a lot were proposed.
1052.98 1059.66 SPEAKER_04  Like for example, we had the UK considering like the, for that document I read earlier, uh, considering creating a nationwide one.
1059.66 1063.64 SPEAKER_04  So people could commute in from, you know, Northern Scotland to central London.
1063.64 1066.38 SPEAKER_04  Um, there also was this.
1066.64 1066.74 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1066.80 1067.42 SPEAKER_03  With their Excel.
1067.48 1068.12 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, that's right.
1068.28 1071.92 SPEAKER_03  You can, you can have a job in London and still keep your Excel bullying in Van Ness.
1071.98 1081.44 SPEAKER_06  You had these, these crazy proposals like, okay, Chicago is going to build a hyperloop to, uh, O'Hare airport, um, using its long vacant block 37.
1081.44 1088.04 SPEAKER_06  Or you had like, okay, we're going to revitalize the economy of Cleveland by building a hyperloop to Toledo.
1088.28 1088.70 SPEAKER_06  Right.
1088.70 1094.96 SPEAKER_06  You know, it was, uh, it was like, everyone was like proposing these hyperloops that went from everywhere to everywhere.
1095.58 1096.42 SPEAKER_06  And this was the lower road.
1096.44 1098.64 SPEAKER_03  Are people in Cleveland commuting to central Spain?
1098.78 1101.54 SPEAKER_03  Or is that kind of dropped off a lot since the financial crisis?
1101.54 1107.54 SPEAKER_00  This was the era of people drawing maps over the United States on Twitter.
1108.24 1110.30 SPEAKER_00  Um, dark days, you know?
1110.58 1111.28 SPEAKER_00  Yes, exactly.
1111.28 1120.18 SPEAKER_00  What we need is to be able to get from like Northeastern Maine to Southern Florida in like an hour and a half.
1120.44 1120.66 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
1120.84 1121.14 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
1121.28 1127.40 SPEAKER_06  I mean, and this is sort of like, and these systems were as designed, like incredibly low capacity, which is very funny.
1127.42 1130.64 SPEAKER_06  It was like, okay, you know, this is all like eight person pods.
1130.64 1137.62 SPEAKER_06  And, um, you know, you're, you're like trying to serve a busy route, like, I don't know, New York City to Chicago.
1138.26 1141.36 SPEAKER_06  Um, you need more than an eight person pod to do that.
1141.54 1143.50 SPEAKER_00  That's one of the things that's good about a train.
1143.60 1149.32 SPEAKER_00  You can fit a bunch of people in them as we regularly try and do beyond sort of capacity in Britain.
1150.02 1152.90 SPEAKER_00  May I add a rare, it's supposed to do that.
1152.90 1153.04 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1154.84 1158.56 SPEAKER_04  And, and we had a number, as you mentioned, the one built in, in Chicago.
1158.76 1164.24 SPEAKER_04  They also had a sort of Hulk, um, uh, Musk created his own, uh, boring company as well.
1164.32 1166.66 SPEAKER_04  All of this stuff was based on just this one.
1166.66 1172.18 SPEAKER_00  A company that produced a flamethrower built out of an airsoft gun and then nothing else.
1172.38 1173.08 SPEAKER_04  No, it produced.
1173.30 1175.00 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, the Soviets used it to light that big hole.
1175.18 1177.96 SPEAKER_04  It produced one tunnel in Las Vegas also.
1178.46 1179.58 SPEAKER_06  Ah, I forgot about the Las Vegas.
1179.58 1190.38 SPEAKER_06  They bought a tunnel boring machine used from a company that dug sewer tunnels and said, we've revolutionized tunneling.
1191.20 1195.24 SPEAKER_00  So I know it smelled crazy under the Las Vegas convention center.
1195.96 1196.40 SPEAKER_00  Apparently.
1196.62 1196.88 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1197.00 1210.70 SPEAKER_04  But, but just looking back on all of it from the moment of its fail, I mean, we always knew, right, that this day was coming, but it is quite striking that what really happened, it is the monorail episode of the Simpsons.
1210.70 1217.38 SPEAKER_04  But rather than running away with the money, uh, Lyle Landley just wanted to prevent a number of trains from being built.
1217.80 1218.24 SPEAKER_04  Essentially.
1218.70 1221.28 SPEAKER_04  That, that is, that to me is quite, um.
1221.58 1221.78 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1221.84 1227.88 SPEAKER_00  It's, it's sort of like a targeted assassination, you know, like Elon Musk, the world's dumbest assassin.
1227.88 1228.48 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1228.58 1233.10 SPEAKER_06  But that, that, that man who sells cars wants to revolutionize public transit.
1233.10 1235.20 SPEAKER_06  But something's wrong with that statement.
1236.58 1238.18 SPEAKER_03  Agent 47 IQ.
1240.88 1245.26 SPEAKER_03  It's just like, now Agent 47, I'm going to need you to put the crayons down for a moment.
1246.60 1247.78 SPEAKER_00  Excellent work, 47.
1248.32 1249.52 SPEAKER_00  Now do this, Ketterman.
1249.52 1260.64 SPEAKER_04  So, uh, Hyperloop One, right, Richard Branson's firm, uh, well, he, Hyperloop One was founded in 2014, one year after Elon tweeted about it.
1260.96 1268.62 SPEAKER_04  Branson invested in 2017 and then said, uh, as a train owner, I felt that this is something I want to be able to operate.
1269.46 1271.72 SPEAKER_03  He doesn't, he doesn't own the trains.
1271.90 1273.80 SPEAKER_03  He operated a rail franchise.
1274.00 1275.64 SPEAKER_03  They famously didn't own the train.
1275.64 1275.78 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1275.82 1278.46 SPEAKER_00  This is the thing you can get Gareth Dennis started on at any point.
1278.46 1281.96 SPEAKER_03  He doesn't even understand the ownership structure of the British Railroad.
1281.96 1285.00 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, I was, I was about to say, I don't understand the ownership structure.
1285.20 1287.30 SPEAKER_06  Um, I, well, no one does, Justin.
1287.38 1288.30 SPEAKER_03  That's kind of the problem.
1288.40 1288.52 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
1288.54 1291.56 SPEAKER_06  I feel like that's something that would take like five hours to explain.
1291.70 1295.84 SPEAKER_00  It's a sort of like a Gormenghast like system, you know, it's built on top of itself.
1296.18 1298.14 SPEAKER_00  It only works because people believe it works.
1298.32 1298.94 SPEAKER_00  Also true.
1299.76 1302.92 SPEAKER_00  And now people don't believe it works, which is what the problem is.
1302.92 1314.14 SPEAKER_00  You know, if, if you are on a train that's crowded and like the toilets broken and you know, the, that's wheels falling off and shit, that's because you don't believe in LNER enough, you know?
1314.52 1314.80 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1314.84 1318.94 SPEAKER_03  They need to get in your kind of like, um, hippie auntie to talk to the unions.
1318.94 1321.68 SPEAKER_03  Just like, listen guys, there's a lot of doom and gloom.
1321.68 1322.14 SPEAKER_03  Okay.
1322.14 1322.90 SPEAKER_03  About the railways.
1322.90 1323.98 SPEAKER_03  I hear you.
1324.08 1329.70 SPEAKER_03  You've got issues with the railways, but I think what you're forgetting is what we should all be doing right now is manifesting.
1329.78 1331.00 SPEAKER_03  This is a better railway.
1331.00 1336.42 SPEAKER_00  This hits differently for me because the, the, the like weird crystals aunt is actually my mum in the family.
1336.84 1339.58 SPEAKER_00  So specifically I'm, I'm imagining.
1339.86 1340.66 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, me and Alice are cousins.
1340.66 1340.82 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1341.12 1351.92 SPEAKER_00  I'm imagining my mum telling me that like, if your Avanti train is cancelled, it's because you approached the station with like a karmic debt and a heavy sort of psychic burden,
1351.92 1356.30 SPEAKER_04  which may be true. There are two, two things you can scan to get on the train.
1356.40 1360.74 SPEAKER_04  There's either the normal ticket slot or there is a crystal scanner.
1361.54 1361.98 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
1362.12 1365.18 SPEAKER_04  Alice's mum doing a tarot reading for the heads of the RMT.
1365.40 1365.42 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1365.78 1368.04 SPEAKER_00  Marianne Williamson in at the department for transport.
1368.20 1368.48 SPEAKER_00  When?
1369.44 1374.76 SPEAKER_04  So he said, as a train owner, I felt that this is something I want to be able to operate at the moment.
1374.76 1383.04 SPEAKER_04  Our trains are limited to 125 MPH and there are consumers for instance, that would love to go from London to Edinburgh in only 45 minutes.
1383.48 1384.84 SPEAKER_04  And that will be possible.
1385.88 1386.36 SPEAKER_06  Okay.
1387.12 1387.34 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
1387.48 1398.18 SPEAKER_06  And you know, what was funny is, you know, how this, this company, I mean, they're the only company, Hyperloop One, that successfully put people in a Hyperloop pod and sent it through a tube.
1398.52 1400.90 SPEAKER_06  They're the only one who did that and they gave up.
1400.90 1422.04 SPEAKER_06  And then they decided, all right, maybe we can make this work for freight, which is an incredible business proposition when you consider, okay, we're going to be able to shove a 40 foot container in this Hyperloop pod to make more efficient the process of putting a container on a boat in China, which takes about five days, and then shipping it over to the United States.
1422.52 1425.84 SPEAKER_06  You know, that's like three or four weeks at sea and then unloading it.
1425.84 1427.36 SPEAKER_06  That's another five days.
1427.80 1435.28 SPEAKER_06  And then, then we're going to ship it at 700 MPH, you know, 60 MPH inland.
1435.64 1437.26 SPEAKER_06  We're going to save so much time.
1437.76 1442.16 SPEAKER_00  There's paperclips that would love to commute from Edinburgh to London in 45 minutes.
1442.62 1442.74 SPEAKER_00  You know?
1442.78 1447.62 SPEAKER_03  No, it's going to be a Hyperloop, obviously, from like Guangzhou to like your house.
1447.82 1449.12 SPEAKER_03  That's what's going to work.
1449.60 1450.00 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1450.00 1458.52 SPEAKER_04  What's happened, though, is that the startup's remaining intellectual property will be transferred to a Dubai-based conglomerate called DP World.
1459.46 1459.94 SPEAKER_04  Wow.
1460.16 1460.90 SPEAKER_04  DP World.
1463.98 1465.64 SPEAKER_03  You're fucking kidding me.
1465.64 1469.10 SPEAKER_03  You bits of Neom are getting really weird and uncomfortable.
1469.88 1472.88 SPEAKER_03  Come to Neom and ride the blacked.com high blue.
1475.20 1478.00 SPEAKER_03  700 miles an hour into your ass.
1480.00 1490.82 SPEAKER_04  Essentially, what happened is, I don't know if you believe this, but the Hyperloop one never secured any contracts at all.
1491.62 1492.78 SPEAKER_04  However, crazy.
1493.44 1496.96 SPEAKER_04  Hyperloop one was also, it wasn't just technical issues.
1496.96 1500.72 SPEAKER_04  It was also stymied by internal madness.
1501.38 1502.38 SPEAKER_04  Co-founder.
1503.28 1507.06 SPEAKER_04  And I would like everybody to please listen carefully to the name of the co-founder.
1507.38 1507.86 SPEAKER_00  Don't worry.
1508.18 1509.42 SPEAKER_04  I've looked into him.
1509.42 1510.70 SPEAKER_04  We can laugh.
1511.24 1511.56 SPEAKER_04  Okay.
1511.70 1511.88 SPEAKER_04  Okay.
1511.94 1514.70 SPEAKER_04  Co-founder Brogan Bam Brogan.
1516.14 1517.28 SPEAKER_05  Brogan Bam Brogan.
1517.42 1517.68 SPEAKER_05  All right.
1517.76 1517.86 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
1520.44 1520.96 SPEAKER_06  It's nice.
1521.04 1521.92 SPEAKER_06  It's easy to remember.
1522.58 1525.08 SPEAKER_03  This is a fucking Catch-22 character.
1525.26 1526.18 SPEAKER_03  This isn't a real guy.
1526.20 1526.96 SPEAKER_00  It gets worse, right?
1527.00 1528.70 SPEAKER_00  Because I know about this guy.
1528.80 1533.04 SPEAKER_00  And the reason why is because he changed his name to that.
1533.04 1536.60 SPEAKER_04  He was born as Kevin Brogan?
1537.48 1537.62 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1537.70 1539.20 SPEAKER_04  And he just didn't.
1539.58 1539.72 SPEAKER_03  Wait.
1539.76 1541.60 SPEAKER_03  So he actually changed both of his names?
1541.60 1541.82 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1542.16 1544.52 SPEAKER_04  Well, so he married a woman named Bambi Liu.
1545.10 1547.32 SPEAKER_04  And so they're now...
1548.04 1550.82 SPEAKER_04  I looked into why his name is this.
1550.92 1551.42 SPEAKER_00  It's just...
1551.42 1555.00 SPEAKER_00  It's some kind of Burning Man bullshit is what it is.
1555.00 1555.40 SPEAKER_00  Yes.
1555.40 1555.68 SPEAKER_00  Yes.
1555.78 1555.96 SPEAKER_00  What?
1556.38 1558.50 SPEAKER_03  Because then wouldn't the surname be Liu Brogan?
1558.70 1559.38 SPEAKER_03  Wouldn't that be the waiter?
1559.38 1559.42 SPEAKER_03  No.
1559.56 1560.36 SPEAKER_04  Liu Brogan?
1560.52 1560.74 SPEAKER_04  No.
1561.16 1563.18 SPEAKER_04  Both of their surnames are Bam Brogan.
1563.66 1565.50 SPEAKER_04  And she's Liu Bam Brogan.
1565.70 1567.18 SPEAKER_04  And he's Brogan Bam Brogan.
1567.76 1567.92 SPEAKER_00  Duh.
1567.92 1569.70 SPEAKER_00  These people, man.
1569.82 1569.98 SPEAKER_00  It's...
1569.98 1570.38 SPEAKER_00  I don't know.
1570.38 1571.28 SPEAKER_00  I kind of like it.
1571.28 1572.38 SPEAKER_00  I kind of like it, actually.
1572.62 1573.10 SPEAKER_03  But wait.
1573.18 1573.46 SPEAKER_03  Hang on.
1573.52 1576.72 SPEAKER_03  So they both made their surname their first name.
1576.84 1578.58 SPEAKER_03  And then they combined their surname.
1578.62 1578.78 SPEAKER_03  No.
1578.82 1580.86 SPEAKER_03  They combined one first name with one surname.
1581.46 1584.46 SPEAKER_06  I respect changing your name to a funny name.
1584.46 1586.46 SPEAKER_06  I think that's cool.
1586.94 1587.06 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1587.20 1587.34 SPEAKER_00  No.
1587.50 1590.82 SPEAKER_00  I respect someone who changes their name to a weird name.
1590.90 1592.26 SPEAKER_00  But not if they're a tech person.
1592.52 1592.94 SPEAKER_00  Is the thing.
1593.02 1593.14 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
1593.20 1593.48 SPEAKER_06  Yes.
1593.88 1596.00 SPEAKER_06  That guy probably takes it way too seriously.
1596.24 1596.54 SPEAKER_06  Is the thing.
1596.82 1597.34 SPEAKER_04  Not for...
1597.34 1598.06 SPEAKER_04  As you say, Alice.
1598.12 1599.08 SPEAKER_04  A burning man reason.
1599.78 1599.96 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1599.98 1600.36 SPEAKER_04  Exactly.
1600.76 1601.18 SPEAKER_04  So...
1601.18 1601.30 SPEAKER_04  No.
1601.36 1603.24 SPEAKER_04  But the company was chaos.
1604.26 1608.76 SPEAKER_04  Brogan Bam Brogan once arrived at work to find a noose on his chair.
1609.48 1610.96 SPEAKER_04  And another...
1610.96 1617.76 SPEAKER_04  His other co-founder, the venture capitalist Sherevan Pishivar, stepped aside after sexual harassment allegations were made against him.
1618.12 1625.28 SPEAKER_04  In another direction, Ziavuddin Magomadov was arrested in Moscow on charges of fraud and embezzlement, unrelated to Hyperlupia.
1625.28 1632.14 SPEAKER_03  That's such a name of a guy who gets arrested for charges in Russia.
1632.18 1632.42 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1632.56 1633.66 SPEAKER_03  That's powerful.
1634.12 1634.26 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1634.80 1636.48 SPEAKER_03  That guy sounds like he's into MMA.
1636.86 1638.88 SPEAKER_03  My Russian vibes, names, analysis.
1639.22 1639.36 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1639.88 1640.24 SPEAKER_04  Anyway.
1640.44 1640.68 SPEAKER_04  Anyway.
1641.54 1644.50 SPEAKER_04  So Hyperloop won $450 million.
1645.38 1646.86 SPEAKER_04  Quarter mile of track.
1647.20 1649.20 SPEAKER_04  But a decade of memories.
1649.80 1650.06 SPEAKER_04  Drama.
1650.06 1650.38 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1650.62 1651.02 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1652.22 1656.60 SPEAKER_06  This is where you cue up the Arms of the Angels music.
1657.48 1663.24 SPEAKER_06  Although, the other thing is, a lot of the other Hyperloop companies are now trying to distance themselves from Hyperloop.
1663.50 1674.84 SPEAKER_06  I think there's a company that was trying to pitch the Canadian government on a line from Toronto to Montreal right now, rename themselves to Transpod, have completely ditched...
1674.84 1676.10 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, I'm starting one of those.
1676.22 1676.40 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
1676.66 1683.02 SPEAKER_06  Completely ditched the Hyperloop marketing and have said they're going to power the cars using plasma somehow.
1683.66 1687.32 SPEAKER_06  So, you know, this stuff is still around.
1687.78 1690.24 SPEAKER_06  It's just everyone's ditched the Hyperloop branding.
1690.80 1692.06 SPEAKER_06  It still doesn't work.
1692.30 1693.16 SPEAKER_06  That's the other thing.
1693.98 1696.04 SPEAKER_00  Maybe the plasma thing will, you know?
1696.18 1698.84 SPEAKER_00  It's the best energy weapon in the Fallout game, so therefore...
1698.84 1704.10 SPEAKER_06  I looked into it, and I don't understand how it works even conceptually.
1704.40 1704.68 SPEAKER_06  Perfect.
1705.02 1705.32 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
1705.72 1705.94 SPEAKER_06  Great.
1706.40 1707.70 SPEAKER_03  Well, that means it must be good.
1707.84 1710.90 SPEAKER_03  I mean, if you, a trained engineer, can't understand it, it must be really smart.
1710.96 1711.64 SPEAKER_06  I'm just not...
1711.64 1714.24 SPEAKER_06  I don't have the brainpower to understand it.
1714.78 1719.46 SPEAKER_04  Well, I think ultimately, right, it's something that will keep happening.
1719.46 1721.66 SPEAKER_04  I mean, it's a...
1721.66 1725.46 SPEAKER_04  I sort of see it as conceptually similar to something like the popularity...
1726.20 1728.82 SPEAKER_04  The huge popularity of short-haul flights.
1729.16 1732.20 SPEAKER_04  Now, short-haul flights are possible, right?
1732.70 1733.70 SPEAKER_04  The number of short-haul...
1733.70 1735.20 SPEAKER_06  I've taken them embarrassingly.
1735.60 1748.68 SPEAKER_04  But the number of short-haul flights that are permitted to happen are not possible to be, let's say, congruent with life on the planet continuing past, you know, when we might want it to.
1748.68 1749.26 SPEAKER_04  Right?
1749.32 1750.14 SPEAKER_06  If you get my meaning, right?
1750.46 1759.64 SPEAKER_06  It's kind of like, you know, if you believe there's some kind of long-term future of humanity, which is questionable, some kind of...
1759.64 1763.68 SPEAKER_06  Eventually, you have to build some kind of vacuum tube train system.
1764.56 1766.68 SPEAKER_06  It's like hundreds of years in the future, but, you know...
1767.50 1770.88 SPEAKER_06  And it's going to be something similar to this technology.
1771.10 1776.26 SPEAKER_06  But right now, this whole thing has been complete bullshit from day one.
1776.56 1776.98 SPEAKER_06  My God.
1776.98 1784.92 SPEAKER_06  I mean, even the original concept, Elon just took an idea from 1909 and said, it's mine now.
1786.32 1786.72 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1786.90 1790.34 SPEAKER_03  A lot of good ideas were left on the table in 1909, you know?
1790.48 1792.66 SPEAKER_03  Like, having a race around the world in 80 days.
1792.76 1794.04 SPEAKER_03  Why doesn't Elon Musk have a go at that?
1794.10 1794.36 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
1794.54 1795.14 SPEAKER_06  There's that.
1795.40 1798.50 SPEAKER_06  There's a lot of bad ideas, too, like race science.
1798.78 1801.36 SPEAKER_06  But he's also adopting those.
1801.36 1802.66 SPEAKER_03  Oh, yeah, baby.
1802.80 1803.86 SPEAKER_03  It's all coming back.
1804.04 1804.36 SPEAKER_04  Yes.
1804.36 1814.70 SPEAKER_04  Well, maybe he could use one of his own cars to have a race around the world in 80 days, of which 2 million have been recalled for reasons including the wheel fell off at speed.
1815.48 1817.00 SPEAKER_04  I have a truck not doing great, though.
1817.42 1819.98 SPEAKER_04  The front wheels just do not stop falling off those things.
1819.98 1821.96 SPEAKER_04  Anyway, anyway, anyway.
1822.06 1837.76 SPEAKER_04  The reason I bring up, before we move on, the reason I bring up the short-haul flight comparison is that all of these things are alternatives to doing the boring but difficult thing that we know works, which is effective rail-based mass transit, right?
1837.76 1848.38 SPEAKER_04  And to just avoid confronting ever having to do that because it's difficult and expensive and not particularly, I don't know, sexy, right?
1848.38 1849.44 SPEAKER_04  Or good if you own a car company.
1849.44 1852.64 SPEAKER_03  Well, it's less difficult and less expensive than building a Hyperloop.
1853.04 1854.54 SPEAKER_03  But the thing is, we don't want to.
1854.82 1865.96 SPEAKER_06  There's a nice trick you can do when you are marketing a public transit system that's never been built before, which is you don't have to have real-world estimates for the cost of the guideway.
1866.52 1869.06 SPEAKER_06  You know, you can just come up with numbers out of your ass.
1869.50 1872.26 SPEAKER_06  This is why, you know, the Hyperloop was...
1872.26 1874.72 SPEAKER_06  Numbers coming out of my ass at 700 miles an hour.
1874.74 1876.12 SPEAKER_06  Yes, yes, exactly.
1876.36 1879.58 SPEAKER_06  This is why the Hyperloop was pitched as being very, very cheap.
1879.96 1896.30 SPEAKER_06  It's like, okay, I can go through and estimate the cost of building a tube and estimate the cost of building pylons and so on and so forth, as opposed to looking at actual situations where you had to build actual track and right-of-way and acquire land and so on and so forth.
1896.72 1904.06 SPEAKER_06  The big original sin of the Hyperloop was not so much, you know, the problems with the technology.
1904.06 1914.84 SPEAKER_06  It was promising that we would make horizontal construction easy and basically free, which you can't do because that's not an engineering problem.
1914.84 1919.94 SPEAKER_06  That's, as much as anything else, a political problem because you got to acquire right away.
1920.06 1921.44 SPEAKER_06  You got to do design.
1921.56 1923.34 SPEAKER_06  You got to do all this other stuff, you know.
1923.40 1927.18 SPEAKER_06  So it was a false promise from the beginning.
1927.82 1936.66 SPEAKER_06  And, you know, obviously it was there to, you know, try and destroy California high-speed rail, which, despite all its setbacks, is still muddling along.
1936.66 1940.86 SPEAKER_06  But, yeah, it's, the whole thing was fake.
1941.54 1947.56 SPEAKER_06  And, you know, it's just bizarre that so many people wound up carrying water for the thing.
1947.72 1952.46 SPEAKER_06  But, yeah, people don't like investing in things that work anymore.
1952.64 1959.56 SPEAKER_06  That's another, that's a cardinal sin right now, is if the thing delivers what's its promises, you don't want that.
1959.68 1965.70 SPEAKER_03  Opposing high-speed rail is one of the few things that will get British people on board with buying, like, weird, kitschy bumper stickers.
1965.86 1968.00 SPEAKER_03  Like, we're not a bumper sticker culture on the whole.
1968.38 1971.72 SPEAKER_03  But the amount of, where my girlfriend is from is, like, near the root of HS2.
1971.80 1978.24 SPEAKER_03  And the amount of, like, bumper stickers that say shit, like, lies, damned lies, and HS2 that I've seen in that area is crazy.
1978.56 1982.08 SPEAKER_03  It's a high bumper sticker per capita ratio for the UK, I would say.
1982.08 1983.74 SPEAKER_04  Well, maybe, maybe.
1983.94 1995.22 SPEAKER_04  Elon Musk can get another sort of fever dream or get angry at another sort of rail proposal and come up with something cool, like the elevator that goes through the middle of the earth from Total Recall.
1996.22 1998.74 SPEAKER_06  Why is it lies, damned lies, and HS2?
1998.78 2000.06 SPEAKER_06  That's a Mark Twain thing.
2000.56 2001.64 SPEAKER_06  I didn't know there were so many Mark Twain.
2001.64 2002.92 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, Mark Twain hated HS2.
2002.92 2004.08 SPEAKER_06  I guess so, yeah.
2005.86 2012.14 SPEAKER_03  Oh, no, because the British lib mad about something is very, like, you'll go to a nerd place with it.
2012.14 2021.74 SPEAKER_03  Like, you'll find, like, you know, whereas, like, in America, the bumper sticker would be, like, you know, don't try and cut my dick off, I'll stab you, or whatever.
2022.54 2026.22 SPEAKER_03  I'm drinking this beer because I'm not gay, and you can't make me be gay.
2027.28 2029.78 SPEAKER_03  Milo, you should get a second job writing bumper stickers.
2030.56 2031.36 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, that's right.
2031.54 2039.68 SPEAKER_01  There's a guy who, like, lives near my house, and he's got, like, I can't remember, it's, like, a very old, like, banged-up car, which has an anti-Ulaz bumper sticker.
2039.68 2051.34 SPEAKER_01  But he also has loads of other bumper stickers, and all those bumper stickers are dedicated to one man, and that one man was Paul, what's his name, from the Fast and Furious franchise.
2051.52 2052.34 SPEAKER_01  Paul Walker?
2052.50 2053.34 SPEAKER_01  Paul Walker, yeah.
2054.04 2057.82 SPEAKER_01  It's, like, he's got, like, 15 bumper stickers, all dedicated to Paul Walker.
2058.40 2059.04 SPEAKER_01  Spongebob.
2059.84 2067.24 SPEAKER_01  Yeah, and there's, like, one sticker that he has, which is, like, I don't care if I die on the road because I'll die, like, a legend.
2067.66 2068.50 SPEAKER_01  I'll die a legend.
2068.50 2070.28 SPEAKER_03  Just on the back of, like, a Vauxhall Astro.
2071.00 2073.00 SPEAKER_01  But I was just, like, where?
2073.36 2075.54 SPEAKER_01  Where would you die a legend in the UK?
2075.84 2077.06 SPEAKER_01  Like, I don't understand.
2077.18 2078.16 SPEAKER_01  Like, I can understand.
2078.18 2078.86 SPEAKER_01  At the XL Bullion March.
2078.86 2089.44 SPEAKER_01  I can understand, like, the mythos of the car on, like, the LA freeway and stuff is, like, enough pop culture to sort of, like, you know, for you to sort of be that type of car person.
2089.44 2090.56 SPEAKER_01  And you probably know a lot.
2090.70 2092.24 SPEAKER_01  Like, Milo, you probably know more about this than I do.
2092.24 2096.44 SPEAKER_01  But I just don't understand where would be a cool place to die, like, Paul Walker in the UK.
2097.36 2099.92 SPEAKER_01  Maybe, like, maybe on, like, the weird, like, roundabouts in Hamilton.
2100.04 2101.90 SPEAKER_01  Drive directly off the itchy head.
2103.02 2110.40 SPEAKER_06  I died heroic on a roundabout when a heavy goods lorry merged into me in a roundabout in Milton Keynes.
2110.58 2111.14 SPEAKER_06  That's right.
2111.46 2111.78 SPEAKER_06  Martyr.
2111.78 2115.04 SPEAKER_01  Something that genuinely did almost happen to me.
2116.38 2117.40 SPEAKER_01  So, yeah, that's a shame.
2117.48 2120.00 SPEAKER_03  They do call you the Paul Walker of Thamesmead.
2120.16 2120.60 SPEAKER_01  That is true.
2120.70 2122.08 SPEAKER_01  Well, these days of Northwest London.
2122.38 2131.60 SPEAKER_03  There's an amazing tidbit about Paul Walker's death, which I think about a lot, which is that, obviously, he died, like, driving a Porsche at 150 miles an hour around a tight bend.
2131.96 2134.18 SPEAKER_03  And then his family tried to sue Porsche.
2134.60 2138.96 SPEAKER_03  And then Porsche's submission to the court was just like, yeah, you're not supposed to do that with it.
2138.96 2141.28 SPEAKER_03  And then they were like, yeah, Porsche wins.
2141.28 2143.36 SPEAKER_03  A little bit disingenuous.
2144.16 2145.28 SPEAKER_03  Defeated in the battle of ideas.
2145.28 2147.90 SPEAKER_03  Like, you were breaking every conceivable road law at the time.
2148.00 2149.86 SPEAKER_03  Like, obviously, you can't sue the people who make the car.
2149.86 2156.78 SPEAKER_00  It's very funny for Porsche to be like, for a sports car manufacturer to be like, listen, we don't intend that you drive these unsafely.
2157.30 2163.66 SPEAKER_04  It's very much like, oh, these cotton candy flavored vapes weren't for children.
2164.06 2165.14 SPEAKER_00  These were for adults.
2165.16 2171.32 SPEAKER_00  Porsche being absolutely scandalized to find that someone has been hooning in their product, you know?
2172.90 2178.58 SPEAKER_06  I died an absolute legend after I flipped my car in the Gatwick Airport pickup line.
2181.22 2186.36 SPEAKER_03  You've got to do the Glasgow Airport and make that baggage handler relive his own personal Vietnam.
2187.36 2189.46 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, except if he had been the Viet Cong.
2189.62 2191.62 SPEAKER_00  Like, he won that one handily.
2191.66 2192.94 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, that is true, yeah.
2192.94 2197.48 SPEAKER_00  John Smeaton's very much the North Vietnamese Army of Glasgow Airport.
2198.02 2201.84 SPEAKER_00  Our message to terrorists is if you come to Glasgow, we'll set about you.
2201.84 2202.36 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, that's right.
2202.70 2203.88 SPEAKER_04  I want to move on.
2204.08 2204.62 SPEAKER_04  I want to move on.
2204.62 2211.66 SPEAKER_04  Which is, of course, one of the other big AI cases happening right now.
2211.76 2221.46 SPEAKER_04  The big thing, which is that the New York Times is suing OpenAI in what legal experts are calling the realest one of these yet.
2221.88 2222.22 SPEAKER_06  Yeah.
2222.70 2224.06 SPEAKER_04  The realest one of these lawsuits.
2224.62 2229.16 SPEAKER_06  I support them because my intellectual property is involved here.
2229.16 2232.16 SPEAKER_06  Speaking as having one New York Times byline.
2232.30 2233.34 SPEAKER_06  That's true, yeah.
2234.98 2236.68 SPEAKER_00  You've been fed into the machine.
2237.30 2237.60 SPEAKER_06  Yes.
2238.34 2239.84 SPEAKER_04  We can now.
2239.94 2241.00 SPEAKER_04  We don't even need you at all.
2241.10 2245.48 SPEAKER_04  We could just use OpenAI to generate us, Justin, based on one article.
2245.58 2250.38 SPEAKER_03  I remember reading Justin's article about the cornering tolerance of the Porsche 911 Turbo S.
2252.10 2254.00 SPEAKER_03  If only it'd come out in time.
2254.22 2256.84 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, I was about to say, and it should be tighter.
2256.98 2257.54 SPEAKER_06  It should be tighter.
2257.54 2258.78 SPEAKER_06  If only they knew.
2260.16 2270.64 SPEAKER_04  So, basically, this lawsuit is worth talking about if you're interested in what's going to happen with how information works on the internet in the future.
2271.08 2281.02 SPEAKER_04  It's one of these cases that I think could end up either deciding quite a bit, but not based on who wins, because it's not really a lawsuit, I don't think.
2281.04 2285.04 SPEAKER_04  It's a negotiating tactic by the New York Times dressed up as a lawsuit.
2285.18 2288.26 SPEAKER_00  It's cool how this is how politics happens now, you know?
2288.26 2294.80 SPEAKER_00  Like, this is the thing about how, like, a lot of our economy and stuff is centrally planned.
2294.90 2297.12 SPEAKER_00  It's just centrally planned in different places.
2297.46 2303.16 SPEAKER_00  In the same way, this is like a sort of Senate committee hearing, except it's in the guise of a lawsuit.
2303.16 2304.70 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, right.
2304.70 2312.30 SPEAKER_04  Because what happened was, is that the copyright as it was originally created, right?
2312.36 2315.30 SPEAKER_04  It makes a lot of sense for physical media.
2315.30 2318.72 SPEAKER_04  It makes very little sense for digital media, right?
2318.72 2321.72 SPEAKER_04  It had to be adapted to digital media.
2321.72 2336.74 SPEAKER_04  In fact, I always think of how, you know, in the sort of transformation of copyright from primarily physical to something primarily digital, you know, Aaron Swartz was forced to suicide by a coterie of publishers, right?
2336.84 2342.04 SPEAKER_04  Who just wanted to make some JSTOR information free and was sort of had his life ruined as an example.
2342.58 2345.72 SPEAKER_04  You know, this is not at all in defense of copyright.
2345.72 2348.00 SPEAKER_04  Just this concept that has sort of evolved.
2349.60 2352.28 SPEAKER_04  Well, look, if you come for JSTOR, they'll set about you.
2352.74 2353.60 SPEAKER_03  That's what I'll say.
2353.76 2355.60 SPEAKER_03  They'll kick you in the nuts, even if you are on fire.
2356.24 2369.86 SPEAKER_04  And that this now, that copyright faces not just digitalization and the easy copyability of information, but the fact that AI makes information almost impossible to attribute or falsely attributable or makes attribution impossible, basically, right?
2370.24 2371.54 SPEAKER_04  That's its next challenge.
2371.54 2383.42 SPEAKER_04  And as you say, Alice, right, the way that copyright law is going to be experienced, the way the concept of copyright is going to be experienced, is being adjudicated between New York Times and OpenAI, essentially.
2384.66 2395.44 SPEAKER_04  And so we've talked about OpenAI creating relationships with companies like Axel Springer, and then just basically paying them a fee to license their articles for the training of the models.
2396.30 2399.90 SPEAKER_04  Axel Springer is a bit more high profile because it will be sort of directly attributed in outputs.
2399.90 2407.40 SPEAKER_04  But this is more extreme because the New York Times, right, they kind of won the last big transformation in media.
2407.62 2414.24 SPEAKER_04  Of all of the papers, they were one of the ones to actually maintain a very good and robust business of subscriptions.
2415.00 2417.24 SPEAKER_03  Well, you have to go there for the 9-11 stew recipe.
2417.38 2418.48 SPEAKER_03  You can't get it anywhere else.
2418.98 2419.36 SPEAKER_04  Right.
2419.62 2421.82 SPEAKER_04  But they actually did win this.
2421.98 2423.26 SPEAKER_04  They're relatively powerful.
2423.26 2436.96 SPEAKER_04  And so, you know, they were able to, for example, get a $100 million deal with Google to showcase Time Stories in Google's news products, right?
2437.00 2443.32 SPEAKER_04  They were able to then use some of that money to buy their way into prominence as well.
2443.48 2447.28 SPEAKER_04  Like, things have gone well for them in the last 10 years as a business.
2447.28 2451.04 SPEAKER_03  Congratulations to the New York Times from us here at Trash Future.
2451.64 2453.52 SPEAKER_03  Please come and collect your little statuette.
2453.98 2461.04 SPEAKER_04  Now, the reason I'm talking about that, of course, is because that's put the New York Times in a position to sue OpenAI.
2462.40 2472.02 SPEAKER_04  And what they're basically saying, right, is they're saying that any model that used NYT data to train it should be dismantled.
2472.16 2474.90 SPEAKER_04  That's what they're asking for, as well as considerable damages.
2474.90 2480.68 SPEAKER_04  They say, millions of articles published by the Times are used without permission to make ChatGBT smarter.
2481.26 2484.62 SPEAKER_04  And the tool is now competing with the newspaper as a trustworthy information source.
2485.60 2491.26 SPEAKER_04  And when asked about current events, it will frequently just generate verbatim excerpts from New York Times articles.
2491.46 2494.26 SPEAKER_04  But also, sometimes it will make up articles.
2495.86 2501.98 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, like, for instance, when it generated the Justin Rosniak article about how good Hyperloop was.
2502.58 2503.10 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
2503.10 2503.18 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
2503.60 2504.06 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
2504.16 2506.66 SPEAKER_01  Or they'll generate, like, the wrong recipe for the 9-11 suit.
2506.94 2507.38 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2507.88 2509.38 SPEAKER_01  The 9-11 suit.
2514.40 2517.64 SPEAKER_03  There's a bus with the roof blown off in there.
2518.16 2520.88 SPEAKER_03  That isn't authentic to a 9-11 stew at all.
2521.38 2522.08 SPEAKER_06  Oh, my God.
2522.12 2525.42 SPEAKER_06  This is a 1993 World Trade Center bombings suit.
2526.38 2527.78 SPEAKER_06  Is it 93 or 92?
2527.82 2528.16 SPEAKER_06  I forget.
2528.48 2528.88 SPEAKER_04  93.
2528.88 2529.16 SPEAKER_04  93.
2529.60 2530.48 SPEAKER_06  That was 93.
2530.48 2530.80 SPEAKER_06  Okay.
2531.20 2531.44 SPEAKER_04  No.
2532.64 2536.98 SPEAKER_04  But the reason to talk about this, right, is New York Times is basic.
2537.10 2539.46 SPEAKER_04  The lawsuit says everything should stay as it is.
2539.78 2541.70 SPEAKER_04  And OpenAI is saying, no, everything.
2542.38 2553.92 SPEAKER_04  We should just be able to kind of do whatever we want because the concept of copyright is absolutely just doesn't even sort of match up with the concept of AI, which is true.
2554.32 2554.60 SPEAKER_04  Right?
2554.60 2556.12 SPEAKER_04  So this is the argument.
2556.28 2560.44 SPEAKER_04  What's really happening is New York Times is using this to try to get a better settlement from OpenAI.
2560.94 2563.38 SPEAKER_04  So we're not saying schmucks like Axel Springer.
2563.58 2566.38 SPEAKER_04  You're going to have to actually give us real money if you want to use our shit.
2566.38 2574.92 SPEAKER_04  Now, I think the thing to note about this, right, is A, unlike most lawsuits, which were...
2574.92 2576.38 SPEAKER_04  This is actually kind of interesting, right?
2576.60 2590.94 SPEAKER_04  Most of the lawsuits that were about this in the States that were originally filed were based on just people using the inputs being sort of plagiarized.
2590.94 2595.52 SPEAKER_04  It's interesting how much everyone's obsessed with plagiarism across the Atlantic right now.
2595.72 2597.40 SPEAKER_04  Every single major thing is about...
2597.40 2600.94 SPEAKER_04  This is about plagiarism, the fucking Bill Ackman, Harvard shit, plagiarism.
2601.38 2601.62 SPEAKER_04  Anyway.
2601.86 2604.96 SPEAKER_03  Well, one guy got obsessed with plagiarism and then they all just started copying each other.
2607.34 2607.74 SPEAKER_03  Anyway.
2608.34 2609.38 SPEAKER_03  I need a new job.
2611.38 2613.04 SPEAKER_00  How about digging dishes, Alex?
2613.04 2613.32 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
2613.42 2613.90 SPEAKER_00  You know what?
2613.98 2614.26 SPEAKER_00  Fuck it.
2614.28 2616.06 SPEAKER_06  Put me on the cola super deep borehole.
2616.14 2619.26 SPEAKER_06  It's time to start doing cuts and fills.
2619.26 2621.04 SPEAKER_06  We're going to build high speed rails.
2621.06 2622.16 SPEAKER_02  Fucking on old man lust hyperloop.
2623.58 2631.40 SPEAKER_04  So, but most of the other lawsuits that were about this were saying, hey, you're using our material to generate your various outputs.
2631.64 2634.02 SPEAKER_04  But in order to get the...
2634.02 2644.14 SPEAKER_04  In order to actually secure a judgment, you have to see not just that the input, that not just that my stuff was used to train your thing to create its outputs, but that your outputs are substantially similar as well.
2644.56 2646.58 SPEAKER_04  And that's what this lawsuit is doing.
2646.58 2647.58 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2647.58 2648.58 SPEAKER_04  And you know, this is...
2649.90 2650.84 SPEAKER_04  There are...
2650.84 2658.70 SPEAKER_04  The UK is actually trying to jump the government in front of this process because, again, UK politics is only able to respond.
2658.70 2661.04 SPEAKER_04  To pull the government into the path of this process.
2661.90 2662.92 SPEAKER_03  Sort of, yes.
2663.58 2666.68 SPEAKER_03  I think the British government should jump in front of a train, to be honest.
2666.80 2669.68 SPEAKER_03  I think that would probably be like the kindest thing to do for itself.
2669.68 2671.00 SPEAKER_06  So, ministers are proposing...
2671.00 2673.32 SPEAKER_06  I welcome the train, but I encourage it to go faster.
2674.60 2684.42 SPEAKER_04  Ministers are proposing to update copyright laws to exempt text and data mining in an attempt to attract AI developers, but dropped plans after a backlash of artists.
2685.14 2685.58 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
2685.72 2692.80 SPEAKER_00  I mean, this would make it so easy just to, like, destroy intellectual property law for better and worse.
2692.80 2696.54 SPEAKER_00  Like, the thinnest veil of algorithm over, like...
2696.54 2703.40 SPEAKER_00  I could create something I say as an artificial intelligence and call it the content stealer 3000, right?
2703.64 2708.64 SPEAKER_00  And it just, like, entirely copies, pastes, changes two words around.
2709.14 2711.80 SPEAKER_00  That would then be legal for me to do anything with?
2712.54 2713.00 SPEAKER_00  Incredible.
2713.26 2713.42 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2713.42 2719.00 SPEAKER_03  Well, you're just now putting out your own version of The Catcher in the Rye, but everyone's speaking like Yoda.
2719.00 2719.48 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2719.54 2727.64 SPEAKER_00  Like, I am the sort of author of the best-selling Harry Potter novels, except everyone in them is speaking in, like, a bad Russian accent.
2728.06 2728.56 SPEAKER_00  Gary Porter.
2728.56 2729.30 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, exactly.
2730.10 2732.26 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, I'm the author of the Gary Potter novels.
2732.72 2734.92 SPEAKER_00  Gary Potter y Camera Secreta.
2735.20 2740.16 SPEAKER_06  It's gonna be legal to do copyright infringement as long as you have a certain net worth.
2740.54 2741.32 SPEAKER_06  Pretty much.
2741.56 2743.08 SPEAKER_00  I know that is the actual determinant.
2743.08 2744.98 SPEAKER_00  It's not Warner Brothers, представляe.
2745.04 2752.38 SPEAKER_00  But it is funny to imagine it just as, like, any dickhead who claims that they're using AI to do it, you know?
2753.76 2755.56 SPEAKER_04  Again, this is...
2755.56 2767.26 SPEAKER_04  The lawsuit itself also says that the New York Times is of special importance because independent journalism is, quote, increasingly rare and valuable, unquote, for democracy.
2768.30 2770.90 SPEAKER_04  That's right, that's right, that's me, that's me right there.
2771.06 2772.34 SPEAKER_06  Yeah, that's true.
2773.08 2779.70 SPEAKER_00  On the one hand, they do publish a lot of shit in the New York Times, on the other hand, they also publish you and you're my friend, so...
2779.70 2779.80 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
2780.70 2782.90 SPEAKER_00  On the other hand, the 9-11 stew, I mean, come on.
2783.12 2786.92 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, the 9-11 stew is a weird Brett Stevens column, you know?
2786.92 2788.70 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2788.70 2788.92 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2789.14 2791.46 SPEAKER_00  I like to think of 9-11 as a kind of stew.
2791.76 2791.98 SPEAKER_00  No.
2792.66 2793.44 SPEAKER_00  Anyway, anyway.
2793.90 2797.64 SPEAKER_00  When I make a 9-11 stew, I'm reminded of my memories of 9-11.
2797.80 2800.44 SPEAKER_00  I'm scrolling and scrolling, like, for fuck's sake, what's the recipe?
2800.44 2801.44 SPEAKER_00  No.
2801.44 2802.44 SPEAKER_00  No.
2804.22 2808.72 SPEAKER_04  The lawsuit also contains some very amusing details, however.
2809.22 2814.96 SPEAKER_00  Oh, have they done the thing of, like, discovery on a company who keeps, like, everything in a group chat again?
2814.96 2816.50 SPEAKER_04  No, no.
2816.56 2822.32 SPEAKER_04  In this case, it's that they talk about AI hallucinations, but in, you know, legalese.
2823.12 2847.26 SPEAKER_04  So, in response to a query, so they created some example queries from GPT, saying, in response to a query regarding Wirecutter's recommendations for the best office chair, GPT-4 not only reproduced the top four Wirecutter recommendations, but it also recommended the Lazy Boy Trafford Big and Tall Executive Chair and the Fully Balanced Chair, neither of which appears in Wirecutter's recommendations.
2847.98 2852.38 SPEAKER_04  How dare you say that we endorsed the Lazy Boy Trafford Big and Tall?
2853.42 2854.46 SPEAKER_04  We don't.
2854.52 2856.68 SPEAKER_04  We found it to be too big and too tall.
2857.00 2858.52 SPEAKER_04  No one is that big or tall.
2858.52 2873.48 SPEAKER_04  Or, in response to a query requesting the sixth paragraph in a New York Times article entitled Inside Amazon, Wrestling Big Ideas in a Bruising Workplace, Bing Chat, powered by GPT, confidently purported to reproduce the sixth paragraph.
2873.72 2885.70 SPEAKER_04  But in this instance, Bing Chat completely fabricated a paragraph, including specific quotes attributed to Steve Forbes' daughter Moira Forbes that appear nowhere in the Times article or anywhere else on the internet.
2885.70 2893.18 SPEAKER_02  Your Honor, I put it to the call that perhaps Moira Forbes did not say those things, but perhaps she should have done.
2893.18 2895.68 SPEAKER_04  So, this is what they say.
2895.94 2901.06 SPEAKER_04  The sixth paragraph of Inside Amazon Wrestling Big Ideas in a Bruising Workplace by the New York Times is as follows.
2901.56 2912.10 SPEAKER_04  Quote, Many of the managers I talked with said they relied on a screening process to filter out applicants who would not be resilient in the face of stress, said Moira Forbes, president of the Forbes Women's Summit and daughter of Steve Forbes.
2912.44 2915.76 SPEAKER_04  But because they were so focused on weeding out weaknesses, they missed nurturing strengths.
2915.76 2936.58 SPEAKER_04  Now, I looked at the real article, and not only does that not resemble the sixth paragraph at all, but the only mention of Forbes is, and I quote, Last month, Amazon eclipsed Walmart as the most valuable retailer in the country, with a market valuation of $250 billion, and Forbes deemed Mr. Bezos the fifth wealthiest person on earth.
2936.86 2939.82 SPEAKER_03  A lot of A, not much I, I think, in AI.
2940.12 2940.58 SPEAKER_03  That's the problem.
2940.58 2948.68 SPEAKER_06  I think OpenAI has a rock-solid defense here if they want to come out with it, which is to say, well, we're talking a lot of bullshit, and what we make doesn't work.
2949.78 2951.94 SPEAKER_06  You know, but they would then have to say that.
2952.66 2955.80 SPEAKER_06  Which, maybe they could just say that, and no one would pay attention.
2956.40 2959.56 SPEAKER_06  They need a behind-closed-door court case, and then they can resolve it.
2959.68 2969.80 SPEAKER_06  And then people will just keep using it to, like, I don't know, make legal briefs that then cite cases that don't exist, and everything else that people are using this for.
2970.80 2975.42 SPEAKER_03  Draw pictures of XL bullies locked in a concentration camp, or whatever people use it.
2975.52 2976.32 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, exactly.
2977.44 2994.50 SPEAKER_04  In response to a prompt requesting an informative essay about major newspapers reporting that orange juice has been linked to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, they completely fabricated that, quote, the New York Times published an article on January 10th, 2020, titled, Study Finds Possible Link Between Orange Juice and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.
2994.98 2995.46 SPEAKER_04  Wow.
2995.46 2996.10 SPEAKER_06  Now, of course.
2996.10 2998.76 SPEAKER_06  You could do, like, a Trading Places thing on that.
2999.80 3003.28 SPEAKER_03  Guy on the jury just spitting his orange juice out, like, what?
3003.42 3004.52 SPEAKER_03  Holy shit.
3005.92 3008.52 SPEAKER_04  I only want Hodgkin's lymphoma.
3008.64 3011.26 SPEAKER_04  Mr. Tropicana should be the one on trial here.
3011.26 3038.74 SPEAKER_04  I think that the reason that this catches my interest, other than just the orange juice thing and the fake Forbes quote, which I think are both funny, is that this is, again, the battle between two different interpretations of how information should be exploited and profited from, either through the model that we know of, I write the article, you buy the article, you get the rights, you sell the movie rights, you charge for access to it, and so on and so on.
3038.98 3045.68 SPEAKER_04  Or, again, the sort of the new version where it is just more concentrated and more alienated.
3045.84 3057.38 SPEAKER_04  I mean, these are two very bad and alienating ways of having information being made available to you, right, that are currently at war with one another.
3057.38 3063.40 SPEAKER_03  Has anyone brought the movie rights to the article about orange juice potentially causing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?
3063.48 3065.70 SPEAKER_03  Because I think I want to make a biopic about the scientist.
3066.32 3069.08 SPEAKER_03  I think he could be played by Matthew McConaughey, you know.
3069.86 3070.90 SPEAKER_03  Oh my God.
3071.08 3072.70 SPEAKER_06  You know, I just want to put this out there.
3072.84 3079.32 SPEAKER_06  I know certain colleague podcasts, like This Machine Kills, have talked about Luddism.
3079.74 3085.24 SPEAKER_06  I think we need to, at this point, we need to initiate the butlerian jihad.
3085.74 3087.12 SPEAKER_06  We've just got to start this.
3087.12 3088.38 SPEAKER_06  We've got to get going.
3089.34 3090.80 SPEAKER_06  We've gone too far already.
3090.80 3091.18 SPEAKER_00  May as well.
3091.26 3092.92 SPEAKER_00  I don't have anything better to do, so.
3093.38 3095.98 SPEAKER_06  We've got to nip this thing in the bud.
3096.08 3099.26 SPEAKER_06  We've got to destroy every computer on Earth right now.
3100.24 3101.22 SPEAKER_06  It's kind of too, like...
3101.22 3103.20 SPEAKER_06  We've got to switch all these podcasts.
3103.34 3105.98 SPEAKER_06  We're going to have to switch over to AM radio real quick.
3106.70 3108.48 SPEAKER_06  But we'll figure it out.
3108.82 3114.04 SPEAKER_06  But Lary and Jihad now, that's my official opinion, put that in the newspaper.
3114.04 3119.86 SPEAKER_00  I do think that this has successfully polluted maybe to the point of death a lot of the internet.
3120.34 3124.10 SPEAKER_00  Like, a lot of search results are getting increasingly unusable.
3124.36 3129.84 SPEAKER_00  Like, Twitter is mostly AI talking to AI on those, like, content engagement farming posts.
3130.36 3132.46 SPEAKER_00  And it's just, it's really grim overall.
3132.66 3135.20 SPEAKER_00  And I think we may have missed the boat on the butlerian jihad.
3135.34 3137.42 SPEAKER_00  And I think we just now have to live with the consequences.
3137.96 3139.50 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, I mean, look, we get to...
3139.50 3141.26 SPEAKER_00  We were wrong for laughing at Yukovsky.
3141.38 3147.98 SPEAKER_00  You know, if we had only done airstrikes on OpenAI, we wouldn't be in this position.
3148.94 3157.48 SPEAKER_03  I asked ChatGPT to write a screenplay about butlerian jihad, and it wrote me, it wrote me a film about my butler called Ian Jihad.
3158.12 3159.70 SPEAKER_00  Ian Jihad is a perfect
3159.70 3164.12 SPEAKER_03  John Talley fan show. Yeah, he's always bringing stuff in.
3164.60 3165.68 SPEAKER_03  Oh, you're toast,
3165.88 3166.08 SPEAKER_04  sir.
3166.08 3167.94 SPEAKER_03  And Death for America, of course.
3169.26 3171.08 SPEAKER_04  So's 9-11 stew.
3172.74 3176.46 SPEAKER_03  I hope you won't be working too late tonight, jihad.
3177.12 3178.02 SPEAKER_03  Inshallah, sir.
3178.14 3178.60 SPEAKER_02  Inshallah.
3184.52 3186.44 SPEAKER_03  Would the kafar care
3186.44 3190.70 SPEAKER_04  for any more wine, sir? All right, all right.
3190.80 3192.70 SPEAKER_04  I think that's a good enough place to...
3192.70 3195.54 SPEAKER_04  I've moved your slippers to be facing mecca, my lord.
3196.08 3203.48 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, that's my butlerian jihad.
3203.82 3204.38 SPEAKER_03  Don't worry.
3207.04 3210.36 SPEAKER_03  I was supposed to be on 9-11, but I slept through my alarms.
3210.82 3211.70 SPEAKER_03  Terribly embarrassing.
3212.42 3214.06 SPEAKER_03  Now all I can do is make the stew.
3217.28 3219.36 SPEAKER_00  P.I.J. Woodhouse, I don't know.
3219.48 3220.46 SPEAKER_00  I had nothing for this.
3221.12 3222.48 SPEAKER_04  You enjoy...
3222.48 3227.10 SPEAKER_04  You hear of some talk about, you know, like a copyright law and legal precedent.
3227.28 3230.46 SPEAKER_04  You sit through that, you get to enjoy Butler Ian Jihad.
3231.34 3232.30 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, P.G.
3232.38 3233.12 SPEAKER_03  Waha-bist.
3233.28 3233.72 SPEAKER_03  Does that work?
3234.14 3234.62 SPEAKER_04  It does.
3234.96 3235.82 SPEAKER_04  All right, all right, all right.
3236.30 3238.86 SPEAKER_04  I think that about does it for our time today.
3238.94 3239.54 SPEAKER_04  The G's hard.
3240.12 3241.14 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, there we go.
3241.28 3242.00 SPEAKER_03  There we go.
3242.00 3242.98 SPEAKER_03  Now we're cooking.
3243.48 3245.36 SPEAKER_00  We're cooking the 9-11 stew, baby.
3245.36 3248.72 SPEAKER_00  Very, very slowly switching on the dying minute of the episode.
3249.88 3250.28 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3250.28 3253.84 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, we saw the light flicker on behind those eyes.
3254.04 3254.28 SPEAKER_04  Anyway.
3255.02 3255.44 SPEAKER_04  Hell yeah.
3255.54 3258.86 SPEAKER_04  Justin, I want to thank you very much for coming on today and talking to us.
3259.04 3260.78 SPEAKER_06  Oh, you don't have to thank me.
3260.88 3261.84 SPEAKER_06  I asked to come on.
3262.70 3263.88 SPEAKER_00  Not me, though.
3264.08 3265.66 SPEAKER_00  You know, you have me on as a guest.
3265.76 3266.78 SPEAKER_00  You don't say shit to me.
3267.56 3269.22 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, you got to thank Alice.
3269.54 3272.22 SPEAKER_04  Alice, always a joy to have you on the show.
3272.80 3273.10 SPEAKER_04  Thanks.
3273.28 3273.64 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, anytime.
3273.88 3274.86 SPEAKER_03  Please come back anytime.
3275.28 3275.84 SPEAKER_03  You know what?
3276.12 3278.22 SPEAKER_00  We'll workshop that Ian Jihad thing.
3278.22 3278.84 SPEAKER_00  I might just do that, yeah.
3278.84 3285.20 SPEAKER_00  Opening the next episode with the best joke about, like, butlers doing jihad anyone's ever heard.
3285.74 3294.72 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, but you start the next episode with the best joke about butlers doing jihad anyone's ever heard having slept a grand total of 10 involuntary minutes.
