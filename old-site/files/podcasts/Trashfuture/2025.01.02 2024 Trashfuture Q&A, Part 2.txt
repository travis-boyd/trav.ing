0.22 17.24 SPEAKER_00  Hello, Trash Shooter listeners. Welcome back to part two of our two-part Q&A episode, our annual question grab bag, in which we went a bit long, about two hours total, and decided to split it up into two episodes. Thanks again for being a Trash Shooter listener, and I hope you enjoy.
30.00 33.76 SPEAKER_01  Let's move on to some more.
33.84 35.22 SPEAKER_01  Do some rapid fire ones, yeah.
35.60 38.08 SPEAKER_00  We have time for a couple more, so I was going to say...
38.08 39.34 SPEAKER_00  We can do some quick ones.
39.60 42.46 SPEAKER_00  Have any of you ever done a no-show to quit a job?
42.68 42.96 SPEAKER_00  Yes.
42.96 45.72 SPEAKER_01  Not a job, but a degree.
46.46 51.18 SPEAKER_01  And I guess technically also multiple further education colleges.
51.82 54.64 SPEAKER_01  Undiagnosed ADHD is not a good time.
54.74 55.86 SPEAKER_01  I don't recommend having it.
55.86 74.48 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, I did a lot of freelance work in my early 20s, working for an Egyptian startup that intended to disrupt education by trying to reproduce the university experience in a series of modular textbooks that can be pieced together.
74.48 76.36 SPEAKER_03  I think I know the one you mean, bizarrely.
76.86 77.02 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
77.02 77.14 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
78.04 86.32 SPEAKER_03  And anyway, I lucked into a crazy, cushy, sort of permalancing job there, just writing these things.
86.42 88.58 SPEAKER_03  But I also was relatively new to London.
88.70 97.90 SPEAKER_03  I lived in a house share with friends from university, and I decided to get a job at a pub, so I would meet other people and have some sociability in my life.
98.10 98.54 SPEAKER_03  But I am...
98.54 99.56 SPEAKER_03  How did the job at the pub go?
100.04 101.20 SPEAKER_03  I don't...
101.20 104.00 SPEAKER_03  I'm not good at doing stuff such as that.
104.96 109.92 SPEAKER_03  The first time I tried to take a payment with the card reader, I dropped the card reader and broke it.
111.14 112.82 SPEAKER_01  Guess that means it's free then.
112.92 113.84 SPEAKER_01  And you just leave.
114.04 114.78 SPEAKER_01  You just walk out.
114.94 116.26 SPEAKER_01  You take your coat and you just leave.
116.26 116.54 SPEAKER_01  You just walk out.
116.96 120.24 SPEAKER_01  Well, that's my shift, and I suppose my employment here at an end.
120.34 120.84 SPEAKER_01  Bye, everyone.
121.06 124.12 SPEAKER_01  You've made a grave mistake by employing me.
124.92 129.92 SPEAKER_03  Yes, well, I guess we can both see that we were both wrong to enter into this arrangement.
130.38 131.34 SPEAKER_03  I'm just going to go.
131.34 146.74 SPEAKER_03  The other thing was that I guess this is like a classic 23-year-old, 24-year-old thing to think, where I was like, okay, well, I still want to have my social life with my friends, so I'm going to be like, hey, pub, can you hire me to work on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, for example?
147.16 152.52 SPEAKER_03  And they were like, no, if we're going to have some working two days a week, it's got to be Fridays and Saturdays.
152.92 158.20 SPEAKER_03  And I tried to do a similar thing with a club on Kingsland Road called The Nest, which is now closed.
158.34 159.00 SPEAKER_03  It was good.
159.08 159.90 SPEAKER_03  I miss The Nest.
159.90 161.44 SPEAKER_03  It was home by the same people as Dance Tunnel.
161.74 164.98 SPEAKER_03  And I was like, they were like, okay, you can show up for your trial shift.
165.10 167.48 SPEAKER_03  And then I was like, I was so nervous beforehand.
167.48 169.58 SPEAKER_03  I was like, I don't want to drop the car machine again.
169.86 171.14 SPEAKER_03  I don't think I'm going to go.
171.78 172.64 SPEAKER_03  And that was the last.
173.12 174.96 SPEAKER_03  It's not even the first time I'd worked in hospitality.
175.12 178.04 SPEAKER_03  I just worked in slower paced hospitality in Canada.
178.36 191.16 SPEAKER_00  I worked at a butcher shop when I was a teenager when I was 15, 16, and I just didn't show up to a Saturday shift basically the day before, or like the week before Thanksgiving, because my parents were going to take us to Thanksgiving at our grandparents' house in North Carolina.
191.50 193.42 SPEAKER_00  And so technically speaking, I got fired for that.
193.58 195.14 SPEAKER_00  So I called and I tried to explain.
195.20 197.48 SPEAKER_00  My boss was like, yeah, well, at this point, you should just not show up again.
197.56 198.94 SPEAKER_00  And so I was like, well, I've been fired.
198.98 199.60 SPEAKER_00  So I quit.
199.90 201.36 SPEAKER_00  And I no-showed unintentionally.
201.60 204.46 SPEAKER_00  Army doesn't really take very kindly to you trying to quit by no-showing.
204.46 207.78 SPEAKER_00  They tend to call the cops and the FBI if I could put a warrant out for your arrest.
208.06 210.46 SPEAKER_00  So maybe that just kind of inculcated a thing in me.
210.66 211.28 SPEAKER_02  What about you, Milo?
211.40 212.48 SPEAKER_02  I don't think I ever have.
212.60 217.26 SPEAKER_02  I think I've only, I mean, I certainly have quit jobs, but I've always like sent an email or something.
217.44 219.62 SPEAKER_02  I don't think I've ever like actually just not turned up.
219.86 220.82 SPEAKER_02  All right, let's do another one.
220.88 221.86 SPEAKER_00  What's your favorite painting?
222.22 226.00 SPEAKER_01  Oh, that's a really tough one because I've got a long list here.
226.08 227.40 SPEAKER_01  Are you familiar with Banksy?
227.40 227.76 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
228.66 232.58 SPEAKER_01  So I guess I might like, yeah, go ahead.
232.70 240.38 SPEAKER_01  I guess overall, John Singer's Sergeant Slade the Agnew of Loch Nore is the painting that made me transgender.
241.16 245.48 SPEAKER_01  There is one in- Be careful before looking at that painting.
245.68 260.46 SPEAKER_01  There's one in the Hunterian by John Hoyland, 1806-69 it's called, that I happened to like run into almost literally right after getting my first like trip to Alan shop, which I find makes me very like emotional.
260.72 261.60 SPEAKER_01  I walked in there.
261.68 264.82 SPEAKER_01  I had like a kind of like borderline religious experience with it.
265.08 266.72 SPEAKER_01  So that's my modern art answer.
267.02 267.22 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
267.44 273.56 SPEAKER_01  So those two for sure, if you want to hear a much longer list, fucking hit the Tumblr ask box or something.
273.84 274.06 SPEAKER_02  Milo?
274.16 275.06 SPEAKER_02  Not really into paintings.
275.32 275.88 SPEAKER_02  Not really.
276.04 281.38 SPEAKER_02  I don't dislike paintings, but I don't, I've not spent enough time looking at paintings to have a favorite one.
281.52 281.72 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
281.78 282.74 SPEAKER_03  You're just like, you know what?
282.82 283.64 SPEAKER_03  I don't need painting.
283.74 284.78 SPEAKER_02  I feel like that's quite on brand.
284.96 285.20 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
285.92 294.20 SPEAKER_03  So there's a couple, there's a couple that I really enjoy when I was, I, I, I really enjoy, hold on one sec.
294.38 295.92 SPEAKER_00  I can, I can take over right now if you want.
296.00 296.14 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
296.30 296.72 SPEAKER_00  Sorry, go ahead.
296.82 301.58 SPEAKER_00  I mean, in terms of what you're describing is kind of like almost religious experience, seeing a piece of art and having it really connect with you in a strange way.
301.94 307.10 SPEAKER_00  My favorite is Le Plain Temps by Pablo Picasso, which is kind of a minor Picasso painting, but absolutely love it.
307.18 308.44 SPEAKER_00  I saw it at the Picasso museum.
308.78 317.84 SPEAKER_00  I think it's now at the Centre Pompidou, but I did a history of modern art study program in Paris when I was in, in college and lived in Paris for a summer.
318.18 320.44 SPEAKER_00  And just, yeah, that painting is just something about it really struck me.
320.50 322.14 SPEAKER_00  And it's always, it's always come to mind.
322.14 335.54 SPEAKER_00  I would also say in terms of once I've encountered throughout the years, almost like it's, it's really on brand for me that I was, I realized this is a part of kind of like echo in the bunnyman trivia, but the promise by Henry Scott to, which I think is the inspiration for the echo in the bunnyman song, a promise.
335.68 338.24 SPEAKER_00  And it's on the cover of one of their later singles as well.
338.44 346.04 SPEAKER_00  And then they not, they did not expect him by Ilya Repin very much, not the Ilya Repin painting that most people sort of like think of as masterpiece.
346.04 346.62 SPEAKER_00  But I don't know.
346.62 347.92 SPEAKER_00  There's something about like that.
348.00 348.40 SPEAKER_00  I don't know.
348.40 351.40 SPEAKER_00  Like, I don't know if that Russian, you can't really call it like Victorian era Russian.
351.40 359.68 SPEAKER_00  Cause it's, it's, it's our struture, but like, you know, it's representing a political reality, but I think like the, the, just the range of expressions on the people's faces in that painting is so stunning.
359.68 361.60 SPEAKER_00  And similarly to the, the, the, what is it?
361.62 362.74 SPEAKER_00  The barge haulers on the Volga.
362.98 373.34 SPEAKER_00  Uh, but I just, Ilya Repin's paintings, like, I think there's a level of sort of like there, there, it's kind of like a art historian, fucking Thomas Kincaid shit.
373.34 382.18 SPEAKER_00  But like that particular one, I just have always been really impressed in the same way that you'll see this in some of the, the kind of like other sort of standout artists you can think of throughout this period.
382.22 387.04 SPEAKER_00  And I don't really know that much about it that much, but like some of the facial expressions and things by Goya, you know what I mean?
387.04 389.46 SPEAKER_00  Like you'll just be really stunned when you get up close.
389.72 403.68 SPEAKER_00  Similarly, like I strongly recommend if you have any interest at all, going to see them in real life, because like something that I found seeing the one time, I think I saw, um, sleeping Cupid by, um, Caravaggio in a gallery, like in the Indianapolis museum of art, it was on loan.
403.68 417.52 SPEAKER_00  And the level of detail of like the cheeroscuro, like the, the, the, the amount of detail you can see, but how much that, that, that subtle transition of light in, for example, Caravaggio paintings, you cannot appreciate how much more profound it is in person versus seeing like any kind of photograph of it.
417.52 422.12 SPEAKER_00  Like no matter how much work, even with like digital correction to try to improve it, seeing it in person is so much.
422.20 424.08 SPEAKER_00  And same thing with, uh, was it Jacques Louis David?
424.36 426.58 SPEAKER_00  See how his, the campuses are fucking enormous.
426.58 426.80 SPEAKER_00  Oh yeah.
427.12 429.86 SPEAKER_00  Seeing those like genuinely strongly recommend it.
429.98 436.34 SPEAKER_00  Um, but yeah, I'd say if I, you know, you, you get to pick one, it's, it's the plant on, uh, the springtime by, uh, Pablo Picasso.
436.34 444.56 SPEAKER_00  I just, I don't know why naked lady lying on a fucking green grass with a goat kind of goat rampant in the background and extremely like abstracted figures, but yeah, it's, I don't know.
444.70 448.30 SPEAKER_03  So I, I think I, I have a few answers to this question.
448.46 455.82 SPEAKER_03  I always really liked the particular painting, the funeral of Shelley by Louis Edward Fournier, but it's not, this is not a blue chip sort of super famous painting.
455.82 463.26 SPEAKER_03  Uh, it just depicts the, uh, funeral of, of like the author, uh, Percy by Shelley in Italy, uh, as attended by Lord Byron and others.
463.26 464.00 SPEAKER_03  I just, I,
464.00 468.88 SPEAKER_00  I really like the detail figure in some ways. I mean, less sex with Greek guys, but you know what I mean?
468.88 471.14 SPEAKER_00  Like, otherwise less dying of sex.
471.36 471.56 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
471.56 472.52 SPEAKER_03  More of more club.
472.52 475.78 SPEAKER_00  You are kind of the Byronic, Byronic hero in a lot of ways.
475.78 477.44 SPEAKER_00  Uh, would you try to have sex with a ghost?
477.44 479.10 SPEAKER_00  We're going to be keeping a bear in his lodging.
479.10 484.54 SPEAKER_00  Would you like, would you try to fuck a ghost like Don Juan in, in, in, in Byron's probably.
484.82 487.56 SPEAKER_03  That was the name of the boat that, uh, Shelley drowned while sailing.
487.56 488.00 SPEAKER_00  Yes, it is.
488.06 488.56 SPEAKER_03  Good, good one.
488.64 489.42 SPEAKER_03  Um, thank you.
489.54 492.34 SPEAKER_03  Uh, anyway, um, look, so this is, I always liked that painting.
492.40 496.80 SPEAKER_03  I think it's, uh, I like it, I guess because of, I always liked the way that the light falls on Byron's face.
496.80 501.90 SPEAKER_03  I think it's a very sad painting with a ray of hope in it, but also it's cause I'm a quite sentimental person in some ways.
501.90 509.18 SPEAKER_03  I also, uh, if I think about other things I really enjoy is, um, any painting by, uh, the group of seven in Canada.
509.18 518.92 SPEAKER_03  So that's like, uh, they, there's a, a group of, um, sort of like, like Canadian landscape painters who like nobody else managed to capture the, um, feeling of the Canadian wilderness.
518.92 524.70 SPEAKER_03  So there's a, a painting, uh, called the red maple that I suggest you look up if you want to see that style.
524.70 525.48 SPEAKER_03  It's quite something.
525.70 531.46 SPEAKER_03  Uh, and then generally speaking, I was thinking about this the other day of just like the, um, that, you know, like the, it's abstract.
531.58 534.86 SPEAKER_03  I think I, I always enjoyed abstract expressionism as a style in general.
534.86 537.56 SPEAKER_03  That's because I think a lot of my tastes are actually quite midwit.
537.56 541.16 SPEAKER_03  And I think it's very midwit to be like, yeah, I love Jackson Pollock.
541.24 547.72 SPEAKER_03  Uh, but you know, I think his, his seeing his paintings in person is quite sort of an, an overwhelming sensory experience, which I, I quite enjoy.
547.72 550.66 SPEAKER_03  And we'll sort of, we'll take, go out of my way to see them when they come to town.
550.78 551.60 SPEAKER_03  Cause you love the CIA.
552.04 552.56 SPEAKER_04  Of course.
552.78 553.02 SPEAKER_03  That's right.
553.10 561.50 SPEAKER_03  I was walking to the gym the other day and thinking about like, yeah, it's basically like the, the forms of like enduring American high art are basically like modal jazz.
561.50 568.66 SPEAKER_03  So like a sort of jazz cause that's come sort of after Miles Davis and then like, like Bill Evans and people like this.
568.66 577.00 SPEAKER_03  And then, um, and then abstract expressionism, even if like the artists weren't, weren't American, the idea for it certainly.
577.00 580.52 SPEAKER_03  And the, the propagation of it certainly was, yeah, we could, let's quick fire.
580.98 581.96 SPEAKER_00  This is actually funny.
581.96 583.32 SPEAKER_00  Cause I was going to make this the last one.
583.36 587.04 SPEAKER_00  And I thought you would, you would find this like, Oh, a quick, easy, simple one from Casey.
587.46 589.60 SPEAKER_00  Why did labor lose the 2019 election?
589.60 593.94 SPEAKER_03  For the same reason that Assad lost in 2024.
594.74 595.54 SPEAKER_00  Russian power.
595.74 601.66 SPEAKER_00  I actually, I actually saw a really, really good, probably the only plausible take.
601.66 610.92 SPEAKER_00  Cause it's impossible to learn from reading British journalism because everything is just like, if for example, you want to learn why did labor lose Scotland over the course of, you know, from where it was under Blair to where it was in 2015.
611.40 617.74 SPEAKER_00  You can't find anything interesting if you search, because all you're going to find is just like, you know, blow hard ass columns about like the woke left and blah, but whatever the fuck.
617.82 619.42 SPEAKER_00  And that's not true, but it's so hard.
619.42 620.56 SPEAKER_00  No one, no one is interested.
620.68 625.42 SPEAKER_00  No one cares because the British, the British media establishment doesn't reward caring or knowing factual things.
625.42 630.18 SPEAKER_00  But James Schneider, uh, who worked with Corbyn actually had a, he had a really, a really good take.
630.20 636.68 SPEAKER_00  And he said, this is, this is his, is that he, if I remember correctly, I believe he was one of the co-founders of momentum, but I know that he worked very closely with Corbyn.
636.70 639.30 SPEAKER_00  And he basically said, like, like people talk about the antisemitism thing.
639.32 640.08 SPEAKER_00  He's like, I'm Jewish.
640.18 641.84 SPEAKER_00  It does come up, but not as much as you think.
641.84 653.92 SPEAKER_00  It was a thing that it was, became a lead in to always put labor on the defensive every single time a single labor person ever was on TV and it was a means of, uh, you know, like a thing you have to basically apologize for or defend and be on the back foot.
654.02 657.48 SPEAKER_00  But he said, if you really break down in terms of polling, that didn't make that much of a difference.
657.48 664.38 SPEAKER_00  And I think, you know, a lot of the ways that people have been treated when they express any support for Gaza or Palestinians, human rights.
664.38 674.96 SPEAKER_00  Um, but basically what James Schneider said was in 2017, you basically had everyone basically talked about hypothetical Brexit and whether or not they would do it.
674.96 681.18 SPEAKER_00  But it was basically like, there was no question of like, we're not going to in the sense of like, everyone was talking about what is Brexit going to look like?
681.18 694.84 SPEAKER_00  And then the European parliamentary elections happened, but then also more than anything, the two year deadline established by Theresa May, when she delivered the article 50 notice passed and went, and they got an extension because they hadn't actually been able to pull it off.
694.92 696.38 SPEAKER_00  Like they hadn't gotten their shit together to do it.
696.64 700.94 SPEAKER_00  And by 2019, that then created this idea of like, wait, does that mean that we just not do Brexit?
701.06 704.98 SPEAKER_00  And that's a bigger fault line for labor than it is for the conservatives.
705.30 710.18 SPEAKER_00  Also, Johnson purged a ton of anti-Brexit, uh, Tory MPs.
710.18 726.76 SPEAKER_00  And then if you also look at things like the, the, the independent group and all the Chukamuna and all the bullshit with them, like they had the ability to actually force the government to include a provision that any Brexit deal would include, single market access, for example, or, uh, a variety of customs union, et cetera.
726.88 732.06 SPEAKER_00  And they didn't, even though they were notionally though, like we're splitting off to form a splinter party because Corbyn isn't anti-Brexit enough.
732.24 734.58 SPEAKER_00  I think the point that Schneider makes is the most plausible.
734.74 740.60 SPEAKER_00  I don't know if it's a hundred percent correct, but Brexit, what the idea of we're not going to do Brexit was an issue in 2019.
740.76 742.06 SPEAKER_00  It wasn't in 2017.
742.26 746.98 SPEAKER_00  And I think that getting to that sort of, we've delivered the notice mandatory two year deadline, it is happening.
747.04 748.00 SPEAKER_00  And then it didn't happen.
748.00 751.14 SPEAKER_00  That created this idea of like, well, actually maybe it couldn't happen.
751.48 753.64 SPEAKER_00  And at the end of the day, what they did was stupid.
753.76 754.40 SPEAKER_00  Don't get me wrong.
754.46 759.86 SPEAKER_00  The way that they, they, they went about doing it, but you also have that fault line being an obvious one.
760.02 764.34 SPEAKER_00  And lots and lots and lots of very, very shady operators basically got into exploit it.
764.34 771.76 SPEAKER_00  Like people's vote and shit like that, who then when labor endorsed the platform of having a second referendum, closed up shop so they wouldn't have to endorse Corbyn.
771.84 775.86 SPEAKER_00  Like it was all, that was all like dark money shit from like the city, like it's really bad.
775.94 778.46 SPEAKER_00  And, but I think, I think that's it more than anything else.
778.52 782.28 SPEAKER_00  And I think at the end of the day, I don't think Brexit is, was a good thing at all.
782.28 786.24 SPEAKER_00  But I think that Brexit was a stand in kind of like stalking horse for a thing.
786.30 787.82 SPEAKER_00  You could blame austerity on.
788.04 789.44 SPEAKER_00  You could say it was the thing you could,
789.44 792.22 SPEAKER_03  it was a thing you could change. It was a big thing you could change.
792.38 792.92 SPEAKER_03  Also, I'm sorry.
793.08 794.76 SPEAKER_03  I misheard you in the, ask the question.
794.92 797.12 SPEAKER_03  I thought you said 2020, 2019 was a question.
797.34 797.64 SPEAKER_03  Okay.
797.76 798.92 SPEAKER_03  Well, it was again, same.
799.08 800.02 SPEAKER_03  My answer is the same.
800.34 804.48 SPEAKER_00  I think anything that anybody says like that, that's the least the most plausible one I've ever encountered.
804.78 808.52 SPEAKER_00  Everything else I've ever encountered has kind of felt like people kind of talking out of their ass the way that.
808.72 810.70 SPEAKER_03  I mean, I think it's all of it, right?
810.72 811.72 SPEAKER_03  I think it's, it's all of it.
811.74 822.16 SPEAKER_03  It's a, a sustained campaign by everybody who had basically everybody who had a voice to argue that these people are in the, in the different, the argument was made to different people in different ways.
822.16 827.66 SPEAKER_03  And it basically cut through, which is these people are not the right sort of people, whether that's the right sort of people to be trusted.
827.78 838.02 SPEAKER_03  The questions that, that has defined every, basically every British election after Blair is going, is always been, how do we reform British capitalism?
838.12 847.88 SPEAKER_03  And to the extent that people are able to address that more, more and less directly, like Corbyn was the one who addressed that most directly, which is British capitalism is in need of reform.
848.02 850.18 SPEAKER_03  Other, other parties have addressed that differently.
850.18 856.30 SPEAKER_03  They've said stuff like the British state is in need of reform, public services, some individual department is in need of reform.
856.30 860.08 SPEAKER_03  The British people are in need of a, of a kind of reform.
860.34 861.48 SPEAKER_03  Things must be fairer.
861.48 862.22 SPEAKER_03  Things must be better.
862.28 866.92 SPEAKER_03  And so on and so on is the question has always been asked, how is British capitalism to be reformed?
866.92 875.60 SPEAKER_03  And fundamentally it's that, you know, that you're not allowed to, that we cannot figure out a way to, to answer that question satisfactorily.
876.34 893.88 SPEAKER_03  So, you know, so that governments are just going to keep on dying because the only other answer, because acknowledging that it is, it is British capitalism that needs reform, not other, not something else will make you inevitably the wrong kind of person who's automatically to be treated with distrust.
894.12 904.86 SPEAKER_03  And so I think that the, and so the whole, the Brexit position that was, that was forced upon them by people who believe they were the wrong kind of people, but that also made them feel like the wrong kind of people, instinctive argument.
905.02 907.72 SPEAKER_03  And that, cause that was the argument that the leave campaign made, right?
907.76 911.58 SPEAKER_03  Which is British capitalism will be reformed by leaving the EU.
911.68 914.14 SPEAKER_03  Again, they didn't say that explicitly, but that's what the argument was.
914.24 915.24 SPEAKER_02  And they didn't say it would be good.
915.24 915.76 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
915.88 916.60 SPEAKER_02  Well, that's what,
916.72 918.28 SPEAKER_03  that's what the NHS bus thing.
918.50 918.82 SPEAKER_00  Like, yeah.
919.12 922.66 SPEAKER_03  Or also just a bit also that's, but that can be a lot of things to a lot of people.
922.66 924.44 SPEAKER_03  It's also like, Oh, we'll have more innovation.
924.68 928.52 SPEAKER_03  Public services won't need more funding because there'll be less stressed by people moving here.
928.60 929.50 SPEAKER_03  We'll have more fun.
929.54 930.98 SPEAKER_03  We can have more funding for public services.
931.14 933.14 SPEAKER_03  We will have fewer burdensome regulations.
933.14 936.74 SPEAKER_03  All these things that make your life difficult and complicated will be gone.
936.84 945.56 SPEAKER_03  You know that, and, but that, and so everybody had their own view of not what Brexit was, but how British capitalism, the life in Britain would be reformed.
945.56 951.18 SPEAKER_03  And so, you know, this is, it's why the probably most, the most successful political party right now is called reform.
951.92 952.82 SPEAKER_03  Anyway, I think,
952.88 954.82 SPEAKER_02  but nobody knows what it means, but it's provocative.
955.20 956.40 SPEAKER_03  To me, that's the level above.
956.52 967.84 SPEAKER_03  That's almost like one step above the question of like the second referendum, which I think was probably pretty decisive, but it's that trying to address that question directly disqualifies you from being the person who's going to be allowed to answer it.
967.84 973.24 SPEAKER_00  I want to ask November and Milo, but one other thing I want to say too, is that I perceived a difference trying to consume as much media as I possibly could in 2017.
973.24 979.66 SPEAKER_00  And then also in 2019, the degree to which the thumb was on the scale in 2019, in 2019, it's so, it makes you sound like a fucking crank.
979.86 980.86 SPEAKER_00  It makes you sound insane.
980.86 992.28 SPEAKER_00  But like, for example, them editing the debate or question time appearance with Corbyn and Johnson, so that if you watch it on iPlayer, people are clapping for Johnson when they were laughing at him and stuff like that.
992.40 993.66 SPEAKER_00  It's utterly mind blowing.
993.66 993.96 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
994.04 999.22 SPEAKER_02  There was a bunch of stuff in that 2019 election where you, yeah, you literally, you do sound like a conspiracy theorist.
999.32 1001.82 SPEAKER_02  If you just, when they Photoshop that fucking communist hat on,
1001.82 1009.04 SPEAKER_00  when they, when they BBC, BBC, like young people, BBC or whatever was like running all these Facebook stories about like, is voting, isn't voting boring?
1009.14 1009.28 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1009.34 1010.80 SPEAKER_00  Voting doesn't change anything, does it?
1010.84 1011.52 SPEAKER_00  And stuff like that.
1011.54 1017.46 SPEAKER_00  It's like, or Johnson showing up so hung over to a remembrance Sunday thing that he put the, he put the wreath on upside down.
1017.46 1020.40 SPEAKER_00  So they just edited in footage of him doing it as London mayor in 2016.
1020.40 1023.48 SPEAKER_00  Like, yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's wild.
1023.66 1025.06 SPEAKER_00  But November, you, you were there.
1025.22 1025.58 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1025.66 1027.48 SPEAKER_00  I mean, I remember that night.
1027.60 1028.68 SPEAKER_01  I remember dissociating.
1029.00 1029.16 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1029.32 1029.58 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1029.76 1035.18 SPEAKER_01  Um, I mean, listen, ultimately the answer is the, the sort of deck was stacked in the way that it was.
1035.28 1039.10 SPEAKER_01  And, uh, we just weren't successful at like overcoming that.
1039.18 1043.50 SPEAKER_01  I think, um, the, the consequences of that, we still don't know all of them yet.
1043.50 1043.86 SPEAKER_01  Right.
1043.86 1050.38 SPEAKER_01  Like, uh, and obviously that's something that, you know, the left, such as a business country has to bear a lot of responsibility.
1050.40 1054.56 SPEAKER_01  Forer, not just our generation, but like also Corbyn's also John McDonald's.
1054.62 1054.72 SPEAKER_01  Right.
1054.76 1058.22 SPEAKER_01  Like part of the reason why, you know, and it's, it's all connected, right?
1058.24 1068.70 SPEAKER_01  Like the reason why those guys are the way that they are is because they had the decades of fucking MI5 tapping their phones and shit, um, in a more obvious way than they do now, et cetera, et cetera.
1068.76 1083.54 SPEAKER_01  But like, uh, there was just this kind of too, too much legacy, too much kind of like, uh, you know, inexperience and just like bad instincts combined with guys like Keir Starmer stabbing you in the back every time you try to do everything.
1083.74 1089.14 SPEAKER_01  I mean, ultimately, I, I think there was a path to victory there.
1089.52 1091.02 SPEAKER_01  What would have happened after that?
1091.02 1091.78 SPEAKER_01  I have no idea.
1092.02 1112.42 SPEAKER_01  Um, and I think we now have to live with the consequences of not having elected Corbyn, which are going to be much weirder and much worse, but which may ultimately like get us to like a better place through different means, you know, sort of a bit sort of like weird, more, uh, sort of like off kilter path, but who knows?
1112.66 1118.32 SPEAKER_00  I will say this that I found very interesting was a BBC summary of the election in 2019.
1118.32 1123.62 SPEAKER_00  And the, the commentator wrote, you know, Corbyn's labor lost the working class, but won the woke.
1123.74 1124.84 SPEAKER_00  That was the verbatim.
1125.06 1126.34 SPEAKER_01  The working class,
1126.54 1133.20 SPEAKER_00  if you will, except every single age demographic of working age in Britain voted for labor, majority labor.
1133.30 1133.50 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1134.28 1135.84 SPEAKER_00  Basically every relationship.
1136.22 1146.08 SPEAKER_00  It's just basically that everyone of retirement age or older voted Tory in such incredible margins and at a higher rate, but like, no labor won the working class, but you can't say because working class in Britain actually means.
1146.34 1146.42 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1146.48 1146.70 SPEAKER_00  Old.
1146.70 1149.36 SPEAKER_03  It means you're, no, because the nineties is a woke decade.
1149.46 1150.96 SPEAKER_03  The seventies is a working class decade.
1151.04 1152.72 SPEAKER_02  It means you're old and you don't go to the gay pub.
1153.06 1153.82 SPEAKER_02  Yeah, that's right.
1153.98 1155.00 SPEAKER_02  You don't use the free machine.
1155.02 1160.58 SPEAKER_01  Now stuff's actually gonna, actually gonna bite for, you know, old people in ways that it wasn't even in 2019.
1161.10 1164.82 SPEAKER_01  You know, it's, it's like significantly worse to be old now.
1164.94 1171.50 SPEAKER_00  I just still find it very funny that when they did the, the flow chart showing the mood, the mood voter moves between towards 2019 and 2024.
1171.94 1174.78 SPEAKER_00  And it was like showing how many Tory voters 2019 moved to labor.
1174.78 1177.72 SPEAKER_00  And it was like, it was eighth on the list and higher on the list.
1177.78 1179.22 SPEAKER_00  I think seventh or six was that they died.
1179.22 1180.46 SPEAKER_00  But the way it was phrased was death.
1180.54 1184.80 SPEAKER_00  So it's like, you know, they were lower than people who chose death instead of voting labor.
1184.80 1188.14 SPEAKER_01  But it's like also all the like small business tyrants.
1188.24 1199.44 SPEAKER_01  There's a line I remember from, I think it's Bill Hayward, the, the IWW guy who said, you know, people, people think we want to take small businesses and destroy them.
1199.48 1200.36 SPEAKER_01  And it's like, no, no, no.
1200.94 1202.24 SPEAKER_01  Capitalists want to do that.
1202.44 1206.04 SPEAKER_01  Once they're through with you, then you're, then you'll miss us, you know?
1206.44 1206.88 SPEAKER_01  Well,
1206.94 1213.40 SPEAKER_03  I, I guess this is what we're, what we're looking at is the British establishment, whatever it is.
1213.40 1225.70 SPEAKER_03  And you know, that includes, that includes people like, you know, Boris Johnson as well has, has put on many different faces in the last sort of, however many years to try to argue that it is able to reform itself.
1225.70 1231.64 SPEAKER_03  And it has put everything into saying, we, we will, we will get it right next time.
1231.72 1233.06 SPEAKER_03  We will make some change.
1233.06 1242.28 SPEAKER_03  And, you know, the huge waves, what you're actually seeing is these waves from some Tory to labor, from Johnson to, to Starmer back to, to whoever, right?
1242.38 1246.76 SPEAKER_03  This is a system that is not, that is now wobbling and is about to fall over.
1246.86 1247.96 SPEAKER_03  That's what the waves are.
1248.06 1249.20 SPEAKER_03  They are huge wobbles.
1249.42 1249.72 SPEAKER_00  Milo.
1249.86 1250.72 SPEAKER_00  Did you have any thoughts?
1250.82 1257.62 SPEAKER_00  Cause you, if I try to listen to BBC two or any of the chat shows, I want to become a Mario brother very, very quickly.
1257.62 1260.80 SPEAKER_00  You seem able to tolerate it a lot more than I can.
1260.98 1262.44 SPEAKER_00  What are your thoughts about what happened in 2019?
1262.44 1263.26 SPEAKER_00  You were also there.
1263.46 1264.32 SPEAKER_02  A lot of it is break.
1264.42 1265.36 SPEAKER_02  A lot of it is Brexit.
1265.58 1269.30 SPEAKER_02  I think a lot of it is that this country is reflexively Tory.
1269.58 1278.12 SPEAKER_02  And I'd even, even amongst people who don't really share a Tory ideology, there is a sense that like, there are people who can be trusted with the management of the country and people who can't.
1278.28 1286.14 SPEAKER_02  And then there's also this thing where like, I feel as though, you know, liking Jeremy Corbyn as much as I do, he's not good at answering difficult questions.
1286.14 1293.06 SPEAKER_02  Not in the sense that he doesn't have an answer, but he's bad at doing like what Bernie Sanders could do, which is just call people fucking idiots to their face.
1293.06 1301.82 SPEAKER_02  And then I remember that time when Bernie Sanders got a round of applause on like Fox News because he just like argued against them on some like insane gotcha question that they were doing.
1301.92 1308.54 SPEAKER_02  And it's like, I feel like there was an element of just like aggression in putting a point across that like that generation of the Labour Party really lacked.
1308.54 1314.90 SPEAKER_02  And like in the, in the British media environment, you needed to be fighting dirty because that that's what everyone else is doing.
1315.10 1318.16 SPEAKER_02  And there's only so far that being nice could get you.
1318.32 1331.94 SPEAKER_00  The reason I wanted to ask this also, Milo was I remember you telling me that when they came out kind of late post manifesto with the plan for like the help for WASP women, basically women who took retirement and got cut out of a huge amount of pension funds, which would have helped your mom.
1332.06 1333.00 SPEAKER_00  She was in that situation.
1333.36 1338.12 SPEAKER_00  And then she still voted Tory, even though there was a thing they were like, the Tories weren't addressing it and didn't care.
1338.22 1339.24 SPEAKER_00  They did it and they didn't care.
1339.58 1344.08 SPEAKER_00  And Labour were saying we are specifically going to do this, but your mom still couldn't bring herself to vote Labour.
1344.22 1354.10 SPEAKER_02  I can't remember because I can't remember the conversation that we had about it, but we did have some kind of conversation about, yeah, that WASP thing that it was weirdly not convincing my mom, but I don't know how she actually voted.
1354.28 1358.70 SPEAKER_00  Cause I could have, I guess when I remembered, I thought you told me that she said she wound up voting for, for, for Johnson.
1358.86 1360.54 SPEAKER_00  But yeah, I mean, I just, it was tough, man.
1360.56 1360.86 SPEAKER_00  It sucked.
1360.96 1366.74 SPEAKER_00  I went and I tried to canvas and I learned very quickly that when you got an accent like mine, the last thing any British person wants to hear is your thoughts on Britain.
1367.06 1371.54 SPEAKER_00  And, uh, so, um, you're better off, you're better off painting fucking figurines instead of voting.
1372.54 1375.00 SPEAKER_00  Like it's just, anyway, it's depressing to think about the event.
1375.08 1376.22 SPEAKER_00  You're not supposed to think about the event.
1376.38 1377.72 SPEAKER_00  So, um, don't think of the event.
1377.90 1382.64 SPEAKER_00  What would all of you be doing if it were not for trash future, both the podcast and also like the state of the world.
1382.64 1387.72 SPEAKER_01  So I guess this is cut to me face down in a ditch dead in the Falklands.
1387.86 1388.98 SPEAKER_00  Cause you invented a time machine.
1389.16 1389.38 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1389.48 1389.62 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1389.62 1389.84 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
1389.84 1402.12 SPEAKER_01  No, I, I mean, listen, I, I would probably still be basically unemployable and I would be one of these people who, I mean, I do this still spend 23 hours a day posting on Twitter.
1402.12 1402.56 SPEAKER_01  Right.
1402.62 1414.30 SPEAKER_01  But I would be doing that in a much more kind of like a miserable situation because that's basically what I was in, uh, before, before you guys hired me, it was, I was, uh, I had dropped out of law school, the aforementioned like ADHD shit.
1414.30 1420.22 SPEAKER_01  Um, and I was just kind of like, I was just posting, you know, I was, it was a really bad situation.
1420.32 1430.52 SPEAKER_01  And I, I don't know this whole project, uh, that while I've been, while I've been podcasting has been to try and like build my capacity to do something other than this just in case.
1430.52 1439.62 SPEAKER_01  But like, I still don't know, you know, I'm in the last year of a criminology degree, but, uh, you know, if people stop listening to podcasts, I, I genuinely have no idea.
1439.74 1440.74 SPEAKER_01  Nothing good probably.
1441.12 1442.46 SPEAKER_01  So thank you for subscribing.
1442.46 1443.02 SPEAKER_01  Oh,
1443.30 1445.32 SPEAKER_03  I, I genuinely don't know.
1445.40 1450.00 SPEAKER_03  I mean, I was, cause I was in a day job that I really didn't like.
1450.14 1464.16 SPEAKER_03  I'm in a different day job now that I like a bit more, but I'm, I mean, I was, the reason I didn't like it was I was unhappy feeling like I was, like I didn't have anything that was my own.
1464.34 1466.68 SPEAKER_03  Like I didn't, I wasn't working on anything that was mine.
1466.80 1470.86 SPEAKER_03  I felt like I wasn't working on anything that met that when I say mattered, I don't mean like that.
1470.94 1472.40 SPEAKER_03  Oh yeah, this matters more than this.
1472.46 1478.66 SPEAKER_03  Sense that like I was working on, like I was working on stuff that was like, like pro forma needed to be needed to be made.
1478.76 1480.08 SPEAKER_03  So it could be said that it was made.
1480.16 1483.10 SPEAKER_03  And then it would be like put into a box and never looked at by anybody.
1483.10 1486.02 SPEAKER_03  Cause it just, it didn't need it to exist, but it didn't matter what was in it.
1486.06 1489.04 SPEAKER_03  And that was, that was like sort of quite soul destroying.
1489.40 1512.98 SPEAKER_03  Uh, so, I mean, I think I, I said, I guess, I mean, I mean, probably the real answer is I would have been probably much more aggressive at looking for a more, I guess, stimulating day job, I think, rather than sort of saying that rather than settling for one that's sort of fine, but that doesn't sort of sap so much of my energy that I can't do this, which I enjoy.
1513.08 1515.20 SPEAKER_03  I mean, that's a very boring answer, right?
1515.28 1522.12 SPEAKER_03  Uh, it's just like, that's, this has allowed me to enjoy my life a lot more than I would have with a more stimulating day job as well.
1522.16 1524.82 SPEAKER_03  That I would have just not enjoyed it less basically.
1525.22 1525.36 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1525.36 1528.82 SPEAKER_02  I mean, in my case, probably just doing more standup with a lot less money.
1528.92 1529.90 SPEAKER_02  So yeah, thanks.
1530.18 1532.20 SPEAKER_02  I, my car would have a lot less horsepower.
1532.58 1534.48 SPEAKER_02  Um, you know, a lot of things would be worse.
1534.64 1536.00 SPEAKER_02  You might still have the old Renault Clio.
1536.10 1538.22 SPEAKER_02  God, that Renault Clio, man, you know what?
1538.30 1539.92 SPEAKER_02  I tell you what, it's a reliable vehicle.
1542.54 1549.48 SPEAKER_02  If you're ever in the market for a 20 year old Renault, let me tell you, you will not regret buying a 20 year old Renault Clio.
1549.90 1551.02 SPEAKER_02  Will stuff break on it?
1551.10 1551.34 SPEAKER_02  Yes.
1551.42 1552.00 SPEAKER_02  Once a year.
1552.08 1553.98 SPEAKER_02  Will it cost less than 200 pounds to fix?
1554.22 1554.58 SPEAKER_02  Always.
1555.76 1558.30 SPEAKER_02  Nothing on that car is worth more than 200 pounds.
1559.06 1563.04 SPEAKER_02  I sold it to someone who was learning to drive for 200 pounds and she was a little bit uncertain.
1563.16 1566.58 SPEAKER_02  And I was like, ma'am, the scrap value of that car is 150 pounds.
1566.68 1568.84 SPEAKER_02  If it breaks down today, you've lost 50 pounds.
1568.98 1569.48 SPEAKER_00  And she was like,
1569.50 1570.02 SPEAKER_02  fair enough.
1571.82 1581.06 SPEAKER_00  I quit my job to be a freelance producer. Most of the reason why was because I had what you would notionally consider like a good job in America with like pretty good benefits and like a competitive salary.
1581.18 1584.66 SPEAKER_00  But it was very obvious that I was never going to get promoted or advanced in that role.
1584.94 1587.74 SPEAKER_00  And if I wanted to, I would have had to continue kind of going more in that direction.
1587.74 1591.52 SPEAKER_00  And I don't think of my, my personality was suited for corporate communications.
1591.52 1595.52 SPEAKER_00  But there were some aspects of my job that I liked where I had to like learn some things.
1595.60 1601.12 SPEAKER_00  And I think of all the things that I did, podcasting was interesting, but really the one that I think interested me more was computer motion graphics.
1601.30 1606.22 SPEAKER_00  And I probably, if I had, this hadn't worked out or I podcasting hadn't worked out, I would have pursued getting a degree in that.
1606.42 1608.90 SPEAKER_00  I still have some GI bill left and I could maybe go to school for that.
1608.96 1617.68 SPEAKER_00  But weirdly, motion graphics stuff and VFX is like an industry that's just getting ultra, ultra exploited and abused with AI bullshit and corporate mismanagement.
1617.82 1619.04 SPEAKER_00  So I don't know if I would have stayed freelancing.
1619.04 1623.74 SPEAKER_00  You know, what's funny though, is I have to say this and like, maybe this is, you know, level of earnestness that makes Milo uncomfortable.
1624.10 1625.70 SPEAKER_00  Sorry, Milo, not mean spirit.
1625.82 1626.48 SPEAKER_00  It's just, you are English.
1626.62 1629.40 SPEAKER_00  As the most English person on the podcast somehow.
1629.64 1635.54 SPEAKER_00  I can't really conceive of what my life would be like right now without the aspect of composing and performing music.
1635.76 1637.10 SPEAKER_00  It's something that I always wanted to do.
1637.14 1645.58 SPEAKER_00  And I never thought I had any ability to, and I've talked about it on the other Q and A, but I think about it because recently I've been doing more and I have to use more like guitar style instruments here because I just don't have space for a piano and that whole setup.
1645.58 1648.76 SPEAKER_00  And, um, it's just wild to me because like it's made such a difference.
1649.04 1657.64 SPEAKER_00  And I don't think that I know for a fact, I would never have had the time or the reason to pursue it if it hadn't been for TF and the clog.
1657.78 1660.00 SPEAKER_03  Well, there was a bunch of audio stuff around you.
1660.08 1660.18 SPEAKER_03  Well,
1660.24 1660.84 SPEAKER_00  yeah. And then,
1661.18 1668.38 SPEAKER_03  and also, and also you, you came up with the skeleton key for you doing music at all is honk ball.
1668.62 1669.78 SPEAKER_03  The class on my radio,
1669.78 1674.28 SPEAKER_00  the story with that, I was literally riding my bike home and I had seen that viral tweet about like Dutch.
1674.28 1675.68 SPEAKER_00  You cannot convince me Dutch is real.
1675.68 1677.66 SPEAKER_00  And someone was like, yeah, major league baseball is called honk ball.
1677.72 1678.20 SPEAKER_00  Hoof to class.
1678.30 1681.96 SPEAKER_00  And for some reason I just had that hook in my head of honk ball.
1682.06 1684.00 SPEAKER_00  Hoof to class on my radio tonight.
1684.08 1684.72 SPEAKER_00  That just came to me.
1684.96 1685.52 SPEAKER_00  And yeah.
1685.60 1687.06 SPEAKER_00  And then Milo was like, fuck it.
1687.14 1687.30 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1687.32 1687.74 SPEAKER_00  Why not?
1687.78 1689.26 SPEAKER_00  Let's just write a stupid song.
1689.30 1693.48 SPEAKER_00  And we just, and it took us like a month and everything we've done since then, everything I've done, I've done serious music.
1693.54 1698.96 SPEAKER_00  So if I've been helping a friend track an actual album, like, you know, it's such a core component of what I do now.
1699.36 1709.64 SPEAKER_00  And so I guess in a way it's like, I don't think I would have had that because even though I always wanted to, too, I don't think I would have had the time or the, the, I wouldn't have had a reason to, for example, take piano lessons at age 35, which I did.
1709.86 1709.96 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1710.00 1720.22 SPEAKER_03  Well, wait, basically it's like you, it's, if you weren't, you would, if you had all the time in the world to devote to something, you'd want to devote more of it to music, but you kind of ended up doing more music from doing that.
1720.22 1720.26 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1720.26 1727.38 SPEAKER_00  And then I think once I had the reason to kind of learn more about it, and obviously with COVID like all this time I couldn't leave the house or couldn't do much outside.
1727.38 1735.62 SPEAKER_00  I started and I happened to get really lucky and have a teacher who just really understood where I was coming from and found stuff that worked with me because no other music teacher had ever really connected that way.
1735.92 1739.12 SPEAKER_00  And I didn't understand it when it was always like classical training stuff.
1739.20 1742.00 SPEAKER_00  I mean, you know, all that shit I'd done before, but I never really connected.
1742.14 1754.82 SPEAKER_00  But then once I had someone who was sort of like, no, I kind of get where you're coming from and here's, here's the way to go about it, you know, to learn more and do more and like improv-ing, you know, like make like, like how to sort of riff and like understanding the music theory behind it, like it made such a difference that it's crazy.
1754.90 1755.68 SPEAKER_00  I mean, I, you know, it's funny.
1755.72 1757.42 SPEAKER_00  I told him when I left, I was like, I just want to let you know that.
1757.44 1760.36 SPEAKER_00  And he was like, that's the nicest feedback anyone has ever given me as an instructor.
1760.60 1762.58 SPEAKER_00  And I was like, well, I mean, it's sincere.
1762.72 1764.80 SPEAKER_00  Genuinely, he's also English, so he's probably uncomfortable with it.
1764.90 1765.00 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1765.00 1766.68 SPEAKER_00  He's never encountered an American before.
1766.88 1766.96 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1767.12 1771.00 SPEAKER_00  I mean, I'm like, I'm so not the effusive American telling you life story shit.
1771.14 1776.30 SPEAKER_00  All like, geez, there's so much, I've seen so many worse examples, people from California, let's a known book, the effusive American.
1776.30 1779.66 SPEAKER_00  Here's a question for you from Luke to kill us.
1779.74 1781.38 SPEAKER_00  What was your favorite restaurant in Australia?
1783.08 1783.76 SPEAKER_00  Sorry, November.
1784.12 1785.72 SPEAKER_02  Interesting, interesting harmony.
1785.96 1788.58 SPEAKER_02  That Japanesey one we had in Sydney was good.
1788.94 1789.08 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1789.58 1789.98 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1789.98 1793.40 SPEAKER_03  The Japanese one we went to in Melbourne was amazing.
1793.50 1794.72 SPEAKER_02  And it was also a Japanese in Melbourne.
1794.90 1800.42 SPEAKER_03  The Japanese one in Sydney with like the sake tasting that got, that sent Nate into the alcohol dimension.
1800.42 1804.72 SPEAKER_00  I wasn't that bad, but then the fucking guy made fun of me at the end of the dinner and all the tipping and stuff.
1804.74 1807.18 SPEAKER_00  And he comes up to the server and he was like, let me just ask you one question.
1807.28 1808.56 SPEAKER_00  What if you could post from your brain?
1808.64 1814.84 SPEAKER_00  Cause I was wearing a TF shirt and I was like, we just had this great big dinner and we, you're tipping you and you're, you're, you're dissing me for my fucking weird ass shirt.
1815.40 1816.22 SPEAKER_00  That's just Australia.
1816.46 1816.98 SPEAKER_00  It was funny.
1817.02 1822.28 SPEAKER_00  It was funny, but it was also, I was like, I was like, man, maybe, maybe the fans comments about the shirts being inscrutable or valid.
1822.38 1828.90 SPEAKER_03  The, the, the shirt, I, the shirt, the, the, the restaurant I enjoyed the most actually was the place that we went for breakfast.
1828.90 1831.58 SPEAKER_03  That was near the hotel in the bad hotel in Sydney.
1834.12 1835.02 SPEAKER_02  That was so good.
1835.04 1836.50 SPEAKER_00  That's a legendary Sydney sport.
1836.68 1836.86 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1837.02 1838.08 SPEAKER_02  Marekville pork roll.
1838.20 1838.40 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1838.40 1838.54 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1838.54 1839.46 SPEAKER_00  Marekville pork roll.
1839.64 1845.98 SPEAKER_00  I love the idea that like, it's one of the oldest Vietnamese restaurants in Sydney and because that you can tell from the name because they couldn't call it a bond me restaurant.
1846.06 1847.76 SPEAKER_00  So how do you explain bond me to an Australian?
1847.84 1848.74 SPEAKER_00  It's like, it's a pork roll.
1848.92 1849.74 SPEAKER_00  That's just what you call it.
1849.84 1854.04 SPEAKER_03  I think the other one is, and this is, this was just me and Hussein.
1854.04 1866.16 SPEAKER_03  We were going for a walk around Brisbane and then we walked into an office building, went up an escalator and then had probably the best, Chinese lunch I have ever had.
1866.32 1868.14 SPEAKER_00  Australia is such a huge country.
1868.32 1875.84 SPEAKER_00  Remember that place we stopped while we were driving from Sydney to Melbourne or from Canberra to Melbourne and it was right on the border at like, Oh, it was like a truck stop.
1876.00 1876.40 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
1876.64 1877.52 SPEAKER_00  I think, yeah.
1877.58 1880.42 SPEAKER_00  Basically between it was in New South Wales, but almost into Victoria.
1880.42 1885.14 SPEAKER_00  And like we had that, that meal where it was like, they had like dim sum, but they also had like meat pies.
1885.30 1885.80 SPEAKER_00  It was incredible.
1886.02 1888.06 SPEAKER_00  I mean, everything I loved, I love Australia.
1889.28 1891.70 SPEAKER_03  Well, once again, Australia, you're great.
1892.04 1892.30 SPEAKER_03  Sorry.
1892.30 1892.94 SPEAKER_03  Oh,
1892.96 1895.80 SPEAKER_02  I think that was a different place. Actually that, I think that was in Victoria.
1895.94 1898.08 SPEAKER_02  The terracotta was just like a truck stop where we got a coffee,
1898.14 1899.00 SPEAKER_00  but the coffee was good.
1899.18 1901.46 SPEAKER_02  Even though everything you could see was just trucks.
1901.46 1903.06 SPEAKER_00  There was like not even a meaningful town.
1903.06 1905.70 SPEAKER_02  It basically looked like Alaska, but the coffee was insanely good.
1905.80 1909.84 SPEAKER_02  And it was like a Polish guy who was complaining that his sons didn't want to work at the truck stop.
1910.08 1912.56 SPEAKER_02  And he needed someone to like an heir to his truck stop.
1912.82 1913.30 SPEAKER_02  He was,
1913.34 1918.44 SPEAKER_03  he was auditioning like travelers. Like, can you fill the, this glory hall?
1918.56 1918.78 SPEAKER_03  Yeah,
1918.78 1921.74 SPEAKER_02  that's right. Um, I don't fill in by the way, fill in.
1921.84 1922.18 SPEAKER_02  That's right.
1922.28 1930.04 SPEAKER_02  I would be, I would be remiss if I didn't say that there's a, there's a place in Melbourne called, uh, Biang Biang, which is a place we used to be a fan of in London.
1930.22 1932.12 SPEAKER_02  Same name, same cuisine, different people.
1932.20 1940.26 SPEAKER_02  Um, but they do a fucking, you can get like a Greg's pastry filled with, um, the fucking, the shit off the top of a cumin lamb noodle.
1940.62 1941.88 SPEAKER_02  Um, it's so good.
1942.24 1942.42 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1942.52 1944.34 SPEAKER_02  It's, it's a crazy food stuff.
1944.34 1945.86 SPEAKER_02  But if you're in Melbourne, you got to do it.
1945.86 1951.50 SPEAKER_03  What's great about Australian restaurants is that like, and we're not even talking about fancy places here at all.
1951.54 1954.02 SPEAKER_03  It's just the standard of normal food.
1954.32 1958.54 SPEAKER_03  Everyday food is so high that we are remembering just like, Oh yeah.
1958.94 1964.10 SPEAKER_03  Like I remember a random Brisbane Chinese restaurant is being like insanely good.
1964.28 1964.50 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
1964.72 1965.20 SPEAKER_03  All right.
1965.48 1967.74 SPEAKER_00  So I'm going to pull some other questions.
1968.08 1972.58 SPEAKER_00  Uh, as you've gotten older, do you think your tech relationship to technology has changed?
1972.58 1974.08 SPEAKER_00  And for the new parents, congratulations.
1974.24 1977.88 SPEAKER_00  How has becoming a parent changed your technology or perspective on technology and politics?
1977.88 1978.58 SPEAKER_00  This is from Ruben.
1978.66 1982.68 SPEAKER_00  Well, I'm the only one who's a parent because this ain't still on pat leave, but, um, I'll answer that part really quickly.
1983.02 1994.40 SPEAKER_00  Uh, I think I'm aware now that like, for example, my daughter, if I like face into my phone notices and she doesn't really understand the screen thing, but she wants to like slap it out of, out of my hand or, or she likes, she likes taking my phone and changing my phone background.
1994.62 1997.28 SPEAKER_00  Uh, often to just photos of her by just mashing buttons.
1997.44 2001.06 SPEAKER_00  She once I'm changed my background to the trans pride thing, uh, which is amazing.
2001.06 2002.66 SPEAKER_00  Cause it basically was like, she's an ally.
2002.92 2003.84 SPEAKER_00  She's calling you an egg.
2003.84 2008.06 SPEAKER_00  Um, yeah, it's like, no, no beloved daughter of mine.
2008.18 2009.48 SPEAKER_00  That's why I grew the mustache.
2009.48 2011.84 SPEAKER_00  So people would stop saying that, uh,
2012.16 2012.84 SPEAKER_04  they,
2012.98 2020.78 SPEAKER_00  uh, but I think more than anything else you realize, like, I mean, obviously like how easy it is to kind of like let hours slip away, like staring at stuff and how much kids don't notice that.
2020.82 2023.48 SPEAKER_00  And then also I think there's a question of learning more about sort of things.
2023.52 2030.80 SPEAKER_00  Like I realized that there's just like a lot more of ubiquitous things to kind of grab kids' attention the same way that like the bright colors of fast food marketing did when I was young.
2030.80 2036.22 SPEAKER_00  Now there's like, imagine an entire multi-billion dollar industry based around doing that except with like YouTube and shit and apps.
2036.48 2038.52 SPEAKER_00  So how has my relationship changed with technology?
2038.68 2040.00 SPEAKER_00  I don't, you know, it's weird.
2040.16 2046.62 SPEAKER_00  I have both have to kind of learn new stuff and kind of keep an open mind, even if I don't want to about certain things that are new developments.
2046.62 2052.58 SPEAKER_00  While also like some of the kind of backbone work of what we do requires me to like learn shit I avoided 20 years ago.
2052.64 2057.76 SPEAKER_00  Like I never wanted to learn Linux command line shit, but I've had to for like networking stuff and so on and so forth.
2057.76 2069.40 SPEAKER_00  I think the biggest thing for me is it's interesting is that a lot of your received wisdom sort of like notions you develop over a lifetime have changed to the point where like in, when I was in college, if you bought something from Apple, it was expensive, but probably good.
2069.42 2072.88 SPEAKER_00  And like the Apple peripheral would be better than the fucking third, third party one.
2072.88 2076.92 SPEAKER_00  Whereas now if you buy like an Apple peripheral or dongle, it sucks and breaks and doesn't work.
2077.02 2080.52 SPEAKER_00  But the one called like all caps weeksy on Amazon is actually pretty good.
2080.76 2086.42 SPEAKER_00  Uh, you know, 3.5 to USB-C adapter from Blemtro in all caps is amazing.
2086.42 2087.38 SPEAKER_00  The one from Apple.
2087.54 2090.08 SPEAKER_02  I love my whole bow HDMI adapter.
2090.46 2103.54 SPEAKER_03  I mean, I think like there's, you know, my own relationship is pretty consistent, but I sort of, the way I, I see, I think a lot of technology being deployed is there's, I mean, there's so many ways to look at it, right?
2103.56 2115.42 SPEAKER_03  I mean, there's, I feel like an old person when I say that it's like, I do worry for like the attention spans of people who grow up on things that are increasingly designed to hold your attention easily.
2115.42 2131.64 SPEAKER_03  Like there's the phenomenon of picky eating, for example, it's a phenomenon where what makes a kid a picky eater is if at an early stage outside the home, they're exposed to something like McDonald's, which is perfect, a perfectly balanced product to addict, to basically addict you.
2131.88 2136.74 SPEAKER_03  And so then they want things that are soft, salty, and a bit fatty, but otherwise bland tasting.
2136.88 2138.04 SPEAKER_03  Like that's what picky eaters want.
2138.08 2140.58 SPEAKER_03  They want things like butter, noodles, chicken fingers, and stuff like that.
2140.58 2165.02 SPEAKER_03  Um, and so I think that what, one of the things that I'm worried about always is that there is increasingly like, you know, intellectually people are becoming like, especially younger people are becoming pickier and pickier eaters because it's profitable to create a giant machine of, um, dopamine chicken tenders in the form of, you know, of increasingly, uh, you know, micro targeted fulfillment.
2165.02 2166.20 SPEAKER_03  And I mean, that's just one thing.
2166.24 2167.74 SPEAKER_03  The most obvious thing is always media.
2167.74 2174.06 SPEAKER_03  Cause like it's, well, if you ask someone to name a job, most, most likely what they'll do is look around and name the job of the thing that they see.
2174.14 2174.34 SPEAKER_03  Right.
2174.36 2179.32 SPEAKER_03  So it's easy to think of media, but then if you think, okay, well, where are things more, where are you more surveilled?
2179.42 2183.32 SPEAKER_03  How are you changing your behavior to sort of adapt to surveillance more?
2183.44 2184.30 SPEAKER_00  For example, right.
2184.42 2192.50 SPEAKER_00  I throw this into, cause I live in, in Geneva, like kids are granted a lot of independence that you kind of don't see as much, certainly not in America, but less so in Britain as well.
2192.72 2198.74 SPEAKER_00  And so I'll see kids probably, let's say, starting from the age of nine or 10 out kind of on their own or with their friends and sometimes much younger, but with like older siblings.
2198.86 2204.34 SPEAKER_00  And you'll see a lot of kids in that nine to say 13 bracket, like with their own smartphones and even iPhones.
2204.34 2207.56 SPEAKER_00  Cause you can walk down the street with a 10 year old with an iPhone and not get robbed.
2207.64 2212.74 SPEAKER_00  And, um, on the bus, on the train or the tram, et cetera, almost always when I see these kids, they're always watching some sort of like Mr.
2212.82 2215.50 SPEAKER_00  Beast analog, either in English or in French or whatever language they speak.
2215.62 2220.76 SPEAKER_00  But like, Monsieur, Monsieur, Monsieur, Monsieur, Monsieur, Monsieur, Monsieur, Monsieur, I don't know.
2222.34 2222.70 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
2222.70 2223.78 SPEAKER_00  I'm just imagining that shit.
2223.78 2234.06 SPEAKER_00  Uh, what I'm saying though is, uh, is that I think the degree to which it's ubiquitous that like, I'll see these kids in like, if they're not playing like swipey kind of candy crush games, there's always watching like some sort of like guy on YouTube talking.
2234.38 2236.20 SPEAKER_00  That to me is just odd because I, I don't know.
2236.24 2244.98 SPEAKER_00  It's, it's so strange to think of like what that must be like when, I mean, I think about how much kind of like latitude I was granted as like a tween in terms of my parents, like not having the energy to be in my business that much.
2244.98 2247.38 SPEAKER_00  Even maybe, maybe they should have it sometimes.
2247.60 2249.80 SPEAKER_00  Nowadays, it feels like there's so many more things that can just lead you down.
2249.92 2251.80 SPEAKER_00  Like, and I don't mean just like in the exploitation route.
2251.86 2258.88 SPEAKER_00  I mean, more just also there's like the level kind of cooking your brain, teaching you completely wrong shit, but also just like, like you said, Riley, killing your attention span.
2259.04 2261.52 SPEAKER_02  You're not just watching milk in my ass dot WMV.
2261.86 2264.10 SPEAKER_00  Download that on a 56 K modem connection.
2264.18 2273.24 SPEAKER_00  That took, it took all night to download all individual little fucking packets on the Usenet and then like recombine them and shit just to be able to watch ass milk dot MOV or whatever it was.
2273.66 2273.90 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
2274.72 2275.80 SPEAKER_00  November, what are your thoughts?
2276.34 2276.52 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2276.68 2320.02 SPEAKER_01  I mean, I, I, I've been feeling pretty ambivalent about this myself just because, uh, like as Twitter, which is my main way of interacting with like social media has become more and more of a, like obviously Nazi website as the sort of alternatives to that have failed to materialize and, you know, spending time on stuff like YouTube and stuff, uh, and with more AI creeping into things and just that kind of like feeling of uncertainty and grossness whenever you, whenever you encounter it, I've enjoyed technology a lot less in general, but, uh, you know, especially, you know, combining that with, uh, with doing the uni degree where I'm like, I have to work and I like have this distraction machine in my hands.
2320.14 2329.20 SPEAKER_01  Um, but on the other hand, this is also the, the thing that I kind of, I do a lot of work on, uh, I posting is kind of work adjacent almost.
2329.20 2333.76 SPEAKER_01  And so it's kind of something that I'm, I'm very familiar with.
2333.82 2336.48 SPEAKER_01  I spend a lot of time with kind of by necessity.
2336.48 2339.22 SPEAKER_01  And I've, I've kind of been slowly drawing that down a bit.
2339.28 2344.08 SPEAKER_01  I don't think I'm ever going to be the kind of person who's just like, okay, I'm, I'm done with social media.
2344.08 2348.80 SPEAKER_01  You know, you can't find me on anything, uh, because it's just like too much of a part of my life.
2348.80 2351.60 SPEAKER_01  But like, it, it doesn't feel as good anymore.
2351.60 2356.70 SPEAKER_01  You know, as many benefits as I've gotten from it, as much as it's, you know, gotten me onto, onto this.
2356.88 2370.96 SPEAKER_01  I mean, most of all, uh, it's like the actual day to day, minute to minute experience of, of like picking up my phone and trying to do something on it, uh, is just like that much more alienating and annoying as much as anything else.
2370.96 2376.48 SPEAKER_00  It's wild to get on blue sky and it's sort of like you run out of new posts the way you would on like 2009 Twitter.
2376.94 2377.34 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
2377.80 2381.52 SPEAKER_01  It's also, it's also like hyper lib, uh, and no one gets jokes.
2381.70 2382.14 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, exactly.
2382.14 2385.78 SPEAKER_01  And the kind of jokes that I like to make are the kind of jokes that those people don't get.
2385.96 2391.84 SPEAKER_00  It's basically, you're going to get, get, you're going to get dogpiled by like Steve dot 1979 dot Gen X not getting your joke.
2392.26 2392.60 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
2392.80 2393.08 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
2393.18 2394.08 SPEAKER_00  Blue sky is pretty.
2394.08 2394.84 SPEAKER_00  Milo, what about you?
2394.88 2399.10 SPEAKER_00  You have to, you have to do the comedy technology thing, which is Tik TOK and Instagram.
2399.34 2400.54 SPEAKER_02  Oh, fuck me, man.
2400.62 2404.98 SPEAKER_02  I'm, I'm, yeah, I'm also mourning Twitter because it's the social network that I was good at.
2405.16 2405.28 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2405.52 2410.56 SPEAKER_02  Um, and then I'm sort of good at Instagram and Tik TOK, but it's so much more effort to do.
2410.62 2414.78 SPEAKER_02  Like I just, but you know, you could just, you could just toss off like dumb ideas on Twitter and they would work.
2414.78 2419.38 SPEAKER_02  Whereas on Instagram, you've got to, it's like a whole thing, you know, you've got to make a Tik TOK, make a real, whatever I do.
2419.42 2424.86 SPEAKER_02  I have been posting screenshots of my tweets, nicely photoshopped onto Instagram, which has been kind of weirdly working.
2425.10 2426.64 SPEAKER_02  Um, but yeah, social media is,
2426.64 2434.40 SPEAKER_00  it's always very funny when you would post something about like some guy with some insane political thing. And then there's like the next smash cut doctor, sorry, sir, we were unable to save your dick.
2434.40 2437.72 SPEAKER_00  And then the lead singer of France Ferdinand reacts was just like, ha ha ha ha.
2437.80 2438.80 SPEAKER_00  Like that is a moment.
2439.02 2439.16 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2439.16 2440.44 SPEAKER_02  Cause he would literally reply.
2440.44 2441.26 SPEAKER_00  Ha ha ha.
2441.44 2442.72 SPEAKER_00  That is, that is, yeah.
2442.88 2445.52 SPEAKER_00  To me, it's like, yeah, Twitter used to have that, that moment.
2445.68 2445.84 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2446.18 2449.66 SPEAKER_02  God bless Alex Capron, it's a man who is not using technology emphatically.
2449.66 2450.52 SPEAKER_02  Tell me Milo.
2450.52 2453.22 SPEAKER_02  Are you familiar with the movies of Jim Jarmusch?
2453.24 2455.46 SPEAKER_02  Are you familiar with the films of Jim Jarmusch?
2455.66 2456.80 SPEAKER_02  I just need to get a lot of them.
2457.16 2458.60 SPEAKER_02  Um, but yeah, um,
2458.68 2460.14 SPEAKER_00  shout outs to those guys. Lovely guys.
2460.26 2462.22 SPEAKER_00  I actually saw Jim Jarmusch film.
2462.26 2467.16 SPEAKER_00  I saw, uh, the limits of control while waiting for a flight out of Sharana airfield, but the sound was turned down.
2467.20 2469.10 SPEAKER_00  So all I could think of was like, wow, Spain looks nice.
2469.12 2471.00 SPEAKER_00  And wow, that lady is naked all the time.
2471.10 2473.04 SPEAKER_02  But then my flight came and I didn't finish the movie.
2473.18 2473.30 SPEAKER_02  So.
2473.42 2473.68 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2473.68 2475.40 SPEAKER_02  But yeah, I am increasingly Luddite.
2475.54 2482.06 SPEAKER_02  Like my, my eldest sister the other day sent me and tagged me in like some AI slop thing on Facebook, like unironically.
2482.06 2483.06 SPEAKER_02  And I was like, oh no.
2483.22 2487.08 SPEAKER_02  And, um, and then the other day I was in like a minor car accident that wasn't my fault.
2487.14 2488.86 SPEAKER_02  Someone just took my wingman off and then drove off.
2488.88 2490.84 SPEAKER_02  And then someone was like, oh, you need to get a dash cam.
2491.02 2492.96 SPEAKER_02  And I'm like, no, no, I won't be doing that.
2493.04 2498.52 SPEAKER_02  I don't, that is the last thing I want is a full permanent recording of every drive I ever take.
2498.52 2500.28 SPEAKER_02  There's something just so hellish about that.
2500.94 2501.66 SPEAKER_02  Um, yeah.
2502.06 2504.72 SPEAKER_03  Hey, look, it looks like we're getting, we're getting close to two hours.
2504.84 2505.78 SPEAKER_03  I mean, there's, um, all right.
2505.82 2507.18 SPEAKER_03  Well then in that case, last question,
2507.34 2512.36 SPEAKER_00  if making money wasn't the issue, where in America would you want to do a show?
2512.54 2514.04 SPEAKER_00  This is from Mitchie R is the question.
2514.30 2514.66 SPEAKER_01  Huh?
2515.22 2515.88 SPEAKER_01  New Orleans.
2516.24 2516.56 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2516.74 2516.98 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2516.98 2518.16 SPEAKER_01  New Orleans is a good answer.
2518.48 2518.98 SPEAKER_01  Um, I,
2519.06 2520.42 SPEAKER_02  I assuming, yeah.
2520.68 2522.16 SPEAKER_02  Do you think that would be a good show?
2522.18 2525.58 SPEAKER_02  I mean, it's a fun city, but do you think we would get a good turnout in New Orleans?
2525.58 2527.02 SPEAKER_00  You have so much of a going out crowd.
2527.10 2528.54 SPEAKER_00  That's kind of like in the same, a fringe thing.
2528.64 2532.66 SPEAKER_00  Like if like the lads who are on a piss or get out, come into your show, like it's, it's that kind of a place.
2532.68 2533.76 SPEAKER_00  Like people will come to a thing.
2533.76 2534.26 SPEAKER_00  Cause it's like,
2534.32 2535.88 SPEAKER_03  I just think I just want to go to New Orleans.
2536.68 2546.12 SPEAKER_01  We've just got like a trumpeter on stage. My answer is obviously I am, I am called to minister podcast comedy to the various, uh, transgender women of Seattle, Washington.
2546.50 2549.22 SPEAKER_01  Uh, and that's, it's kind of out of the way.
2549.28 2550.98 SPEAKER_01  I think we would do a really good show there.
2551.04 2553.88 SPEAKER_01  I think it would go over very well, not least cause there's a lot of tech.
2554.14 2558.20 SPEAKER_00  Washington's one of our biggest markets in terms of like, our hosting platform breaks it down by state.
2558.20 2561.24 SPEAKER_00  It's like California and Washington more than New York even, which is, yeah,
2561.24 2565.24 SPEAKER_01  it's, it's gotta be like a, well, like 14 hours of flights or something.
2565.48 2568.36 SPEAKER_00  No, it's like, I think it's like nine or 10 hours from the UK.
2568.36 2570.50 SPEAKER_00  Cause the curvature of the earth is pretty far North.
2570.66 2570.92 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
2570.92 2572.04 SPEAKER_00  It's, it's not as bad as you think.
2572.12 2573.68 SPEAKER_00  It's still bad, but it's not that bad.
2573.68 2574.08 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
2574.12 2575.44 SPEAKER_00  San Francisco is like 11.
2575.70 2578.38 SPEAKER_00  So I think it's like Washington to get there.
2578.46 2580.38 SPEAKER_00  Um, but it sucks for me, but I'm from America.
2580.46 2581.90 SPEAKER_00  So I'm used to flights being longer than fuck.
2582.18 2587.12 SPEAKER_00  Um, I'm used to taking longer to fly from New York to Seattle than sometimes if you get lucky, New York to London.
2587.26 2588.96 SPEAKER_00  I have a, I have a funnier answer.
2589.24 2593.04 SPEAKER_01  Um, I, I just conceptually it would be a terrible show.
2593.08 2594.00 SPEAKER_01  It would be baffling.
2594.00 2604.30 SPEAKER_01  I want to do a live show in Whittier, Alaska, the town that is in one building and that is only accessible by sea or through a shared railroad car tunnel.
2604.46 2605.98 SPEAKER_01  I mean, to be honest with you, having lived in Alaska,
2606.14 2609.04 SPEAKER_00  if you go to those places, like they're just like, this is, it's cool that somebody came here.
2609.10 2609.50 SPEAKER_00  So fuck it.
2609.52 2610.30 SPEAKER_00  Let's, let's just get down.
2610.36 2611.78 SPEAKER_00  We would, we would probably be pretty well.
2611.78 2616.22 SPEAKER_01  We get, we get like every single person in Whittier, like into trash future.
2616.22 2618.92 SPEAKER_01  We're getting much of like obvious fraud office, windbreaker orders.
2619.06 2619.26 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2619.38 2619.64 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2619.70 2621.84 SPEAKER_01  They'd probably be too cold for a windbreaker,
2621.84 2624.16 SPEAKER_02  but you might find obvious fraud office park. Yeah.
2624.16 2626.90 SPEAKER_02  You might find this podcast a little bit whittier than you.
2627.18 2628.16 SPEAKER_02  What about you, Milo?
2628.30 2629.20 SPEAKER_02  You've been to America a bit.
2629.34 2630.76 SPEAKER_02  Uh, Port Stanley, Falkland.
2630.76 2633.20 SPEAKER_02  In America?
2633.42 2635.20 SPEAKER_02  Just for the aesthetics.
2635.60 2636.10 SPEAKER_02  Oh, sorry.
2636.20 2637.48 SPEAKER_02  Was this specifically in America?
2637.66 2638.28 SPEAKER_02  Oh, in America.
2638.62 2639.62 SPEAKER_02  Um, I don't know.
2639.68 2644.02 SPEAKER_02  I mean, well, it'd be fun to, uh, it'd be fun to do a show in Nashville because that's where my sister lives.
2644.08 2649.90 SPEAKER_02  But I mean, any, any of the major cities in America, I'd be very happy to, I'm at the point with America to admin.
2649.90 2652.96 SPEAKER_02  I am trying to make this happen for you people, by which I mean the listener.
2653.36 2655.76 SPEAKER_02  Um, but, uh, that I would settle for anywhere.
2656.14 2656.58 SPEAKER_01  Fuck it.
2656.70 2657.04 SPEAKER_01  Delaware.
2657.36 2659.48 SPEAKER_02  I don't care if they'll give us a visa.
2659.66 2660.34 SPEAKER_02  I'll do it.
2660.34 2660.48 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
2661.24 2662.00 SPEAKER_01  Columbus, Indiana.
2662.00 2664.28 SPEAKER_01  Joe Biden's beach house on Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.
2664.56 2667.26 SPEAKER_00  There's, there's a part of me that's kind of like, I mean, I'm from America.
2667.56 2668.42 SPEAKER_00  I was born and raised there.
2668.72 2672.56 SPEAKER_00  I guess there's a part of that wants to be like, I want to play the VFW hall in Carmel, Indiana.
2672.56 2675.00 SPEAKER_00  So you motherfuckers can fucking be like, yeah, piece of shit.
2675.06 2675.50 SPEAKER_00  You made it.
2675.52 2677.66 SPEAKER_00  But they just called, they just called the cops on us.
2677.66 2680.08 SPEAKER_00  So, uh, and that would also require me to go back to Hamilton County, Indiana.
2680.18 2683.02 SPEAKER_00  So I don't really want to, I would say, they'd call the gay cops.
2683.46 2685.98 SPEAKER_00  They would remember me like, Hey, don't we have your high school yearbook?
2686.04 2686.78 SPEAKER_00  You look gay as hell.
2686.78 2688.08 SPEAKER_00  And then they'd arrest me for that.
2688.08 2694.92 SPEAKER_00  For some reason, they would be right to, uh, what I would say is, uh, you know, to me, it always seems really cool.
2694.92 2706.78 SPEAKER_00  Like there's the closest thing we had to kind of like big time, like DIY indie stuff that was going on near us was in Chicago, obviously, which is a six hour drive away from Indianapolis, but like Indianapolis is a fake city and Chicago isn't.
2706.90 2711.24 SPEAKER_00  And so to me, I think doing a show in Chicago, even if like, it wasn't necessarily, I don't know.
2711.26 2713.26 SPEAKER_00  Like that's, that's not necessarily improbable.
2713.34 2717.48 SPEAKER_00  It's, it's far more likely to do a show there than like, I don't know, Cairo, Illinois or something just for the hell of it.
2717.48 2738.46 SPEAKER_00  Um, I'm no November knows what Cairo is, but no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, Cairo is good friends.
2738.62 2739.02 SPEAKER_00  It's Cairo.
2739.12 2740.92 SPEAKER_00  It's Cairo like the city in Egypt is pronounced Cairo.
2741.34 2741.74 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
2741.90 2742.06 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2742.06 2742.16 SPEAKER_01  Yeah.
2742.16 2750.60 SPEAKER_01  I mean, Illinois is fun because my understanding of it is Chicago, outer, outer Chicago suburbs, which are like 150% Hitler.
2750.60 2752.58 SPEAKER_01  And then the rest of it is like Alabama.
2752.58 2752.90 SPEAKER_01  Yes.
2753.02 2753.42 SPEAKER_01  Like,
2753.52 2753.98 SPEAKER_00  yes, yes.
2754.00 2757.78 SPEAKER_00  Well, you basically it's, it's, it's like you said, it's, it's like a, I think of it like a bullseye.
2757.84 2762.98 SPEAKER_00  It's like Chicago in the center, Hitler particle, dense concentration, like, like, like heavy water on the outside.
2762.98 2766.76 SPEAKER_00  And then everything else is the house, the serial killer is in, in silence of the lamps.
2766.78 2770.18 SPEAKER_00  Like, like downstate Illinois.
2770.32 2775.02 SPEAKER_00  So yes, like, uh, what a state and, uh, that's about to get a new flag.
2775.28 2775.56 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
2775.56 2776.34 SPEAKER_00  And all of,
2776.44 2776.76 SPEAKER_01  all of the,
2776.88 2785.90 SPEAKER_00  yeah, I, I would say it's far more likely for us doing a show in Chicago than like, you know, like novelty name, American town, or I don't know, like fucking just like HECO, West Virginia or something like that.
2785.94 2786.34 SPEAKER_00  You know what I mean?
2786.34 2795.18 SPEAKER_00  But, uh, to me, I don't know, I guess if I think about how many times I had to basically commit, commit myself to like long distance road trip, just to see a band being able to do a show.
2795.26 2795.72 SPEAKER_00  That would be cool.
2795.72 2807.26 SPEAKER_03  I think like we should do, a show in Niagara Falls, New York, a, uh, a town that is, exists as throwing garbage over the falls of Canada loud enough that it can be heard in Niagara on the lake.
2807.32 2811.42 SPEAKER_03  Niagara, Niagara Falls, that's two towns over cause Niagara Lake and Niagara Falls are different towns.
2811.48 2812.20 SPEAKER_03  No, that's what I mean.
2812.28 2812.42 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
2812.42 2812.60 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
2812.74 2813.28 SPEAKER_00  So it's two towns.
2813.28 2816.52 SPEAKER_00  That would be like if you didn't get approved for American visas, but it did for Canadian visas.
2816.52 2819.20 SPEAKER_00  So we just went to Windsor and try to do the show really loud.
2819.20 2820.62 SPEAKER_00  So people in Detroit could hear us.
2820.84 2821.72 SPEAKER_00  Oh, I hope,
2821.72 2824.30 SPEAKER_03  I hope I get my Canadian visa. Yeah.
2824.72 2825.18 SPEAKER_00  All right.
2825.18 2825.44 SPEAKER_00  All right.
2825.44 2827.10 SPEAKER_03  We've, we've gone over two hours.
2827.22 2829.36 SPEAKER_03  Uh, you heard me explain the thing about the double bonus.
2829.52 2831.74 SPEAKER_03  Thank you for another year of listening to this show.
2831.88 2835.44 SPEAKER_03  Uh, we look forward to doing another year with you in 2025.
2835.88 2836.28 SPEAKER_03  Absolutely.
2836.36 2837.18 SPEAKER_03  Whatever it brings.
2837.30 2837.46 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
2837.46 2839.16 SPEAKER_00  Thank you so much for being supporters of the show.
2839.64 2840.04 SPEAKER_00  Genuinely.
2840.04 2842.98 SPEAKER_00  And, uh, I hope you enjoyed this life for all of us.
2843.04 2848.28 SPEAKER_00  I mean, and, uh, look for more weirder merch as I try to kind of manage that process and streamline it.
2848.28 2849.58 SPEAKER_00  And just thank you again for listening.
2849.58 2863.88 SPEAKER_00  And, and, and obviously we, uh, we appreciate you all sending your love to Hussein, who is taking a very deserved rest as a new father who sent me a video of his child falling asleep to what sounded like some sort of doom metal drone or like game music of like a scary level.
2863.88 2867.84 SPEAKER_00  And he said, I can't, I don't understand why this is the only thing my child will fall asleep to.
2867.94 2877.72 SPEAKER_00  And then I sent him a video of me being able to soothe my daughter by holding her on my arm when she was like three weeks old and bounce, gently bouncing her to the wild Daft Punk's defunct played in the background that it actually worked.
2877.82 2878.54 SPEAKER_00  So, you know what?
2878.76 2879.44 SPEAKER_00  Parenting is weird.
2879.98 2882.28 SPEAKER_00  Uh, and with that, I will say thank you for another great year.
2882.40 2882.52 SPEAKER_00  Yeah.
2882.60 2884.68 SPEAKER_00  Uh, thank you to my co-hosts,
2884.68 2890.84 SPEAKER_02  all of you. And please come out to my shows in the low countries in Australia, which I guess is the lowest country of all when you really think about it.
