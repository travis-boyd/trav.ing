59.22 80.90 SPEAKER_05  time i get feedback that's true um we all we all talk to each other in marine todd voice um we got a few things uh to talk about today a few news items uh as we said something in the in the dod and then we've got our option of two readings if there's time uh choose your own adventure trash future edition well you the listener don't choose your own adventure no you get what you're
80.90 86.66 SPEAKER_01  fucking giving you hogs you drink the swill that is poured into your trough and you'd be glad of it
86.66 169.54 SPEAKER_05  we will be choosing the adventure and you will be going on it with yes which is kind of like a regular book i guess no so the the first segment though i wanted to do a little bit of a little bit of british politics which we'll be doing again in the future which is in the context of having watched a um a clip from the world economic forum in davos uh where some british um sort of like senior british journalist uh was discussing the country is now having quote unquote gone through its populist moment that's now finished and over oh okay and that the election uh that's coming up will be far less consequential because both of the parties are relatively business friendly now ignoring the um you know the let's say uh strong whiff of populism as these people understand it around sort of you know the um uh rwanda bill now passing the commons and going to the lords well drowning asylum seekers isn't populism that's just sensible yeah and again with the concept of the will of the people being sternly invoked by uh rishi sunak again very amusing that this the guy who was it who has enforced on the on the on the country through basically a coronation by um by the people for whom britain's most addled home counties racist that was not a limited enough electorate guys i know i'm not your real dad but we
169.54 185.54 SPEAKER_06  can be friends i can look after you look when your mom's away we can go bowling we could go drown the asylum seekers together wouldn't that be fun just like old times yeah so in in this environment there
185.54 205.44 SPEAKER_05  were a few things i'd noticed um that were just on the the collapsing britain chronicles yeah chronicles of ridiculous yeah the first of which is that royal mail remember royal mail oh i know a lot about royal mail oh my god we do we we send a lot of t-shirts yeah we do i i i have to interrupt
205.44 249.50 SPEAKER_03  really quickly with royal mail if it's okay riley to tell my quick royal mail side please i bought some stuff from a guy and he was normally nothing was different than the previous way of shipping his audio equipment but somehow royal mail decided it was undeliverable and because his return address was his or incorporation address and not his home address it there was a strong risk it wasn't going to come back it was it wasn't going to be returned to sender and i was like but this is ridiculous you delivered stuff from him same way a week ago no problem why is it undeliverable what's going on and they're like well sorry it's illegal for us to intervene now that it's been called undeliverable it's going to our national undeliverable office in belfast and you can figure out a way to get it from there and i was just like a national unmentionables office so what you're saying is that if you can't if it's deemed undeliverable without a delivery attempt it has to go to your black site across
249.50 257.12 SPEAKER_05  the irish sea on a boat yeah it has to go out of royal mail's like legal jurisdiction to uh to
257.12 261.78 SPEAKER_00  egypt where they will be interrogating it listen so we're going into the royal mail undeliverable
261.78 275.02 SPEAKER_03  black site yeah that was the point is that it feels like every british institution i encounter has a black site like an illegal detention site somewhere it's like veolia has the bin man black site where like if if you've overfilled your bins one too many times that's the only place you
275.02 305.44 SPEAKER_05  can black bagged and take it to a wheelie bin upside down uh so royal mail i should have saw what you're fucking recycling which by the way we um was yeah royal mail which was privatized yeah it was right at a huge discount yeah which was basically again that that's good business by the way it's run any good business you want to run the country like a business yeah you take your infrastructure your back office and your stuff that works and you fire sell it pennies on the dollar then rent it back
305.44 314.70 SPEAKER_06  yeah and also here's a really clever thing they did so they got goldman sachs to manage the sale the ipo sort of thing of royal mail and then uh who bought a huge amount of raw mail stock at a 50
314.70 341.06 SPEAKER_05  discount look who can say uh and it's all legal anyway royal mail is going to need a taxpayer bailout oh good yeah oh so but it was going so well is it is the black site too expensive to run yeah they're all of the money that they get from like reselling gray market audio equipment that's meant for us specifically it no longer apparently is able to support it's a good example of another
341.06 345.64 SPEAKER_02  great institute great british institution that went woke and got broke yeah that's right yeah
345.64 352.26 SPEAKER_03  they went woke by deciding to give jobs to woke boat drivers boat like boating crews to ferry all
352.26 370.78 SPEAKER_05  the undeliverable post across the irish sea for some reason so so right it will require a bailout because it is no longer profitable for it to maintain its minimum service levels after um a huge amount of cost cutting that has now happened for years to deliver dividends to investors oh great
370.78 419.38 SPEAKER_03  crazy yeah one of the interesting things that i noticed just because of dealing with royal mail stuff with shipping parcels recently is that they now charge you extra to drop off a parcel that you've metered yourself uh which to me is like okay the u.s postal service has its foibles let's be real but it's still a nationalized it's one of the rare national things that's not privatized in america but to me i was like but surely it costs more to have the postie fucking pick your shit up and take it i don't know why but now they charge you i want to say like an extra pound to take stuff if you've if you've pre-metered it yourself and it's just sort of like i so i've noticed these weird little things happening with it but it's just like once again it was privatized what in like 2013 2010 2012 2013 okay so yeah like basically a little more than a decade ago and we're already in oh no we got a bit bailed out territory well it's that basically what so the way
419.38 464.88 SPEAKER_05  it works for americans listening is that royal mail is a private company it's owned by like it's owned by some international group called like international delivery services or something like this well it's publicly traded right yeah it's a publicly it's a publicly traded company that's majority owned by sort of by by a conglomerate that does this kind of thing and it but it it has legal specific legal obligations to like deliver mail a certain number of days a week and you know the and basically it's it is saying like either we have to make the service worse or we have to significantly raise prices which we've already done by the way and that's not even to say right how much uh royal mail is used by like essentially by amazon to kind of free ride it's the post you have to have it it's like it's
464.88 474.06 SPEAKER_06  so insane it's like it's like saying that like i don't know like like the police has ceased to be a profitable enterprise or like the i don't know the army has ceased to be profitable the nhs has ceased to
474.06 487.36 SPEAKER_05  be profitable it's like we said that with water essentially we say that with power in certain parts of the country we say that with like phone service in certain parts of the country like it's not supposed to make money it's supposed to do a thing i would also point out like this is a thing that you see
487.36 552.40 SPEAKER_03  in places in america like i know uh friends who live in oklahoma have experienced this that there are like red states in america that have cut budgets in the sort of like grover norquist style republican insane doctrinaire way and now public school state school only meets four days a week because they literally can't afford to have kids in school every weekday um good and the four-day work yeah that's right they've gone low yeah exactly they adopted the preston model in fucking lot in oklahoma so i in a way it's like i could foresee that sort of thing happening where it's just yeah more slow degradation more more reduction in capacity but yeah but as you said earlier riley like it's the same thing because i'm experiencing the sharp end of thames water and they apparently build sewer pipes out of fucking candy glass hence the one that collapsed you don't want to end up at the thames water black site my friend i was gonna say isn't that just beckton yeah they they can fucking waterboard you the a13 beckton turnoff well you don't want to smell like that but tames water is another example of this you know that that it's like oh no uh they do make money they just dump it all into shareholder dividends and no reinvestment in capacity whatsoever and so it's like yeah well
552.40 562.58 SPEAKER_05  cool yeah while they're dumping into the ocean yeah so but hey you know what we're all gonna get a chance to invest without the burden of ownership when we get a government bailout a friend of
562.58 571.96 SPEAKER_07  mine when they when they privatize royal mail uh and this is possibly the most cambridge university story of all time was piss drunk and realized that the shares were going on sale at midnight and he
571.96 587.08 SPEAKER_01  bought like he spent his entire student loan on royal mail shares because he was like eight pints deep and then woke up in the morning and remembered what he'd done and was like oh fuck oh shit and then opened the like the share account and realized that he just doubled his money overnight and was like oh
587.08 628.12 SPEAKER_05  not so bad after all actually okay fine yeah well you know maybe this was a huge scam hey wait a minute yeah but the the other sort of um piece of like and again put this in the context right of this sort of um davos assuredness that britain is now through its populist moment yet populism again as these people understand it which is that hey by the way the services are still going to get worse we're not funding it if that we're going to have more bailouts but the idea that like there is no longer a kind of channel through electoral politics just talking about parliament only for those things to go into means that it's now safe to do this again which i think is ludicrously stupid well another way to look
628.12 660.80 SPEAKER_02  at it is that for them it's there's not the threat sort of been neutralized was the idea that like the populist moment is over is more that like the outside there's no sort of material outside force that disrupts the kind of political system that exists partly because the parties in who are sort of in contention for government are just very willing to adapt and adopt the populist policies anyway right so like only if they're pushing rightward though they're not entirely incorrect i think it's just like well look populism is when you solve the problems and pragmatism is when you don't solve
660.80 693.62 SPEAKER_03  them but in like a sensible way i would also say that it feels like they will adopt them either in in in in letter or in spirit so long as they are right wing ones but there are also positions political movements you know uh policies that are supported by significant majorities in this country that they will i mean re-nationalization is a great example that they're like no sorry we won't do that we won't be we don't care if you want it the one time you wanted something was brexit and that's the will of people the rest you can fuck off and it's like excel i mean americans maybe
693.62 699.48 SPEAKER_06  yeah yeah the xl bullies are being sent to sort post at the royal mail black site that's the news
699.48 713.54 SPEAKER_03  if you don't pick up your post they're gonna feed it to a dog called hitler's revenge that kind of implies that they're taking all the xl bullies from england and putting them on boats across the irish sea like a fucking spanish armada yeah yeah which is like toxic fart clouds that's gonna be the
713.54 730.30 SPEAKER_05  border between northern and southern islands i was just saying that's why that's why actually in 200 years there are going to be so many like irish and scottish people who have dog it's like why i have black hair you know anyway what your ancestors fucked the dog no no i think it's the opposite i
730.30 738.32 SPEAKER_06  think scottish toddlers are going to become immune to xl bullies they're going to become the strongest like it's going to be like the rats in a barrel thing like the scottish are going to build the
738.32 757.44 SPEAKER_05  strongest toddlers of all time so and they're going to become a menace the next thing i want to talk about of course rachel reeves also at davos and in the next bonus episode we're gonna be sure that was an electrifying speech that everyone was really excited jesus christ we're gonna be talking a lot about some of the ai madness at davos but this is a little taster of as someone who's been concussed
757.44 762.06 SPEAKER_03  numerous times i was going to say representation is so important when i see labor politicians give
762.06 809.34 SPEAKER_05  speeches so rachel reeves has said that this is this this floored me when i saw it do you do you know what what podcaster floored by rachel reeves ordering in perfect english yeah yeah orders in perfect swiss at davos so live davos right white woman shot so so here's i mean i i was astonished to see this but remember what would we say is the single most successful showpiece conservative policy of the last 14 years in terms of maximizing the stability of the government that's enacting it would we have said maybe it's liz truss's cut on the top or on top rate taxpayers is that is that what rachel reeves is suggesting that it is no that's what she wants to do
809.94 827.24 SPEAKER_06  oh in time because in terms of actually cementing tory power you've got to say like doing brexit but that has actually been incredibly toxic to individual tory administrations which is keeping the tories in power in general uh-huh great move well i mean they they kind of cracked the whip on
827.24 833.62 SPEAKER_03  their own parliamentary party to get rid of any mps who would have sent yeah no it is rachel reeves has
833.62 863.18 SPEAKER_05  looked at the last 14 years of tory government and has said it looked at liz truss and has said we need to give this another go we're gonna give trussonomics another go what the fuck we're gonna cut taxes she said ms reeves vowed to ensure that quote success is celebrated under a labor government as she outlined ambitions to ease the burden of rishi sunak's multi-year tax rate on workers and hinted that tax cuts for top earners are on the agenda as she attempts to recast labor as the
863.18 889.90 SPEAKER_06  party of economic growth like why like i mean look i i do think there's there's too much dumb focus on like what you're doing with tax of people who essentially earn like sort of like upper middle class incomes when there's like huge amounts of tax at the top that you could be going after which is huge amounts of money and is so popular because everyone hates those guys but like why why would you be talking about a tax cut for people on 150 grand a year like why well because she wants to
889.90 902.58 SPEAKER_05  this is again a quote she wants to focus on all working people and that includes those paying the highest 45p rate which is like two percent of the country yeah yeah that's pretty crazy so what yeah i
902.58 922.72 SPEAKER_03  was gonna say because people forget how the median income is is quite low here and i mean you could have made the argument a little while ago that cost of living was also a lot lower so it didn't matter as much but now that's not the case at all um what's interesting to me about that i mean okay i isn't there's is it 150 or 120 is the threshold for the higher rate of tax and she and that includes
922.72 926.48 SPEAKER_05  and you know what according to rachel there's also the phase out of the individual allowance too so
926.48 949.50 SPEAKER_03  there is like there's definitely a thing where people if you got like you said got above a certain like into the 150 ish range they might find themselves earning less once they had or earning the same when they got a raise but at the same time it's like as you said previously that's such a small number of people so like who are you trying to placate with this when it's like okay we're aspirational britain aside yes but like you can look at the math and like well uh it does kind of look like
949.50 1019.62 SPEAKER_05  only two in a hundred britains earned it is a knee-jerk reactive thing it is quite literally a a kind of instinctual reaction when asked a question to just answer in that way to say things that are essentially distinguishing you from someone who is not dangerous to give the sense to the people at davos that britain is safe basically and the the idea there the fundamental principle is that britain is now safe it's safe for davos it will never be there's never going to be anything that happens here that makes the davos people either um uncomfortable because you know all the davos people tend to be quite good liberals quote unquote right but also there's not going to be anything that makes them poorer for coming to britain so you should you should trust us but it's the the complacency again as services wither and die that at the same time the same conversations are being had to woo people to bring in the same shrinking amounts of money to come to come here and the imagination is there will never be a political reaction against that ever never that will i would also say too that is
1019.62 1125.90 SPEAKER_03  something that i feel like as an american i pick up a lot here is that america obviously is you know there's a horrible cross of living problem and there's a lot of like really serious just like quality of life issues but in many ways you can buy your way out of the collapsing state and the collapsing infrastructure in the united states in the sense that because of a variety of things to include how taxes work there um you can live in a community with great roads and great schools and all this shit even in a state city state county country where many people live in in abject misery but in in this country in the united kingdom it feels like they're gambling on the idea that no every single person who lives here is going to be subject to this increasing ever increasing shitness and that's never going to blow back there's a pothole on downing street i fucking guarantee it like there's no you cannot escape how shit this country like you can't like like like it like it doesn't matter if you live in a postcode where the median income is a half million pounds a year like if you call an ambulance it's going to take a fucking hour like you know if you go to a and e it's going to take forever if you you know your sewer might collapse i don't own my home but like there are people who live on our street like have been dealing with thameswater subcontractor shit suck trucks that are getting paid easily a thousand pounds a visit not their workers but the contractor billing thameswater to suck sewage basically from their manholes in the back garden in up through a hose through their house smelling the place up multiple times a week and like you can't escape that and so that's the thing it's so interesting to me about this is that like when you think about the numbers of people who are experiencing like the life conditions getting worse here and they're like oh no no no we we need to focus to make sure that this tiny tiny subset of the ideologically they feel comfortable it's like right but they're they're probably not british and like if they are going to come here it's just to buy a 18th home to do fucking money laundering in
1125.90 1207.64 SPEAKER_05  or they're going to buy a piece of the post office because they know that a royal mail because they know that it's going to that the free money tab is going to get turned on i'm going to go and live in the royal mail black site so anyway that i have always had a fascination with belfast so anyway that's that's all the britain that i sort of have the timer stomach for um i want to talk to uh the new and improved chat gpt that has decided to delete the part of its terms of service that says it will not ever be used for any kind of military application oh okay that's cool just removing that just taking that out this was this was uh written up in the intercept um and it's this is this is from the intercept it says open ai this week quietly deleted language expressly prohibiting the use of its technology for military purposes from its usage policy up until january 10th its policy included a ban on activity that might has a high risk of physical harm including specifically weapons development and military and warfare and uh now what they have done is two things number one they've deleted that policy number two they're now working with the depart u.s department of defense next day and they said no no no no don't worry ah don't worry we're not developing some kind of an autonomous killer drone no way chat gpt drone would be hilariously ineffectual though what i want
1207.64 1222.10 SPEAKER_01  though is chat gpt drill sergeant like listen up as a large language model i cannot tell you that you do push-ups like you eatin pussy but that is in fact what you're doing how on fucking earth milo
1222.10 1347.72 SPEAKER_03  has remembered one of my stories yet again where i there was this insane sergeant major hazing these lieutenants that were about to go to ranger school and he was like man what the fuck how push-up is that you don't even use those muscles when you fucking you can't even do that right and he's that that's just lodged in his brain it's going to replace an important childhood memory well that now we've automated him um i use one of the things that i saw reading the article that you that you linked to riley was them talking about using this specifically to to parse information for stuff like uh translating source materials analysis things of that nature but like if my you know brief forays with fucking around with chat gpt or any indication like the degree to which it just wholesale fabricates stuff when it doesn't have the answer or it tries but it's so off to me i think about this like i don't know if this is it's sinister but also it kind of to me seems like an opportunity for them to waste more money on a thing that like just will not work and you and i all of us know the thing that brought me on the show as a guest and then you know eventually led to me becoming a co-host and the producer was other military technology that i'd seen in real life that fundamentally did not work but that they had dumped a ton of money into procuring so i'm interested in like how they foresee this because on one hand there's like you know reams and reams of stuff that has to get processed when they would for example do like intelligence collection at least and then that's you know i only saw it a relatively small like low level but you imagine that much higher levels tons more stuff but this thing kind of i don't know like my my story about using it and asking it to cite cite books uh about a historical figure and it just made up all of the titles like i'm interested in how this would be envisioned to work because clearly as like a as a as a like a weapon system like a like a like a drone a uav something no that's i just i i cannot foresee that doing anything besides just being a disaster but i could foresee them using this for a system and passing that kind of muster until it got to the end user and then it's still a disaster but then it's in deploy you know like it's it's in use we've used this bug to intercept audio of iranian military training we've
1347.72 1352.74 SPEAKER_07  had it translated by chat gpt and then it's just like you're doing push-ups like you're fucking and
1352.74 1383.26 SPEAKER_05  you don't even do that right so um well you may say that nate however i have a quote from a deputy defense secretary here saying that ai is part of a comprehensive warfighter centric approach yeah they're fighting the war fight sorry uh fight warring centric approach innovation yeah we're in the fight war with the warfighter that secretary that defense secretary lloyd austin and i have been driving from day one i'm i'm concerned that it might have given uh lloyd austin some kind of
1383.26 1394.98 SPEAKER_03  terrible i was gonna say lloyd austin is actually ai now because his corporeal form is currently in stone cold lloyd austin yeah because he's dead and they pretend that's not true yeah uh so
1394.98 1425.48 SPEAKER_05  so right the um out cold lloyd austin they say they say there are a lot there's a lot of good there in terms of how we can use large language models to disrupt critical functions across the department and again i think the the idea that open ai seems to have right and that is that their showpiece and i mean this is such a stupid guy showpiece um thing to have is like oh we're going to use ai not for fight warring or war fighting we're going to use ai to prevent veteran
1425.48 1431.42 SPEAKER_07  suicide uh-huh okay we're going to build a computer from her yeah yeah but it's going to be like don't
1431.42 1517.92 SPEAKER_03  worry those are just fireworks yeah prevent veteran so something that i think never gets mentioned um unless it's you really dig into the weeds of of analysis on this is that when that number that would get cited often of um 21 veterans commit suicide a day um the overwhelming majority of those veterans committing suicide are in the same demographic that is also the most predisposed to suicide in america and that is white men over the age of 55 so there is don't get me wrong if you look at the sort of like tranches across age economic status demographics like yes veteran vet being a veteran puts you at a higher risk for suicide in every age bracket but if you were to look at that that that that averaged out 21 a day the overwhelming majority of those would be people who would also be at risk for suicide even if they weren't veterans just in terms of sheer numbers and so i am kind of curious because a lot of times that overlaps with deaths of despair a lot of times that overlaps with social isolation and on this show we have seen you know doodad knickknack sort of ai solutions to things that are just like oh what if a what if your your boss made you talk to an ai to help you not be depressed at work i kind of wonder if that's if they've just bought the same marketing
1517.92 1547.32 SPEAKER_05  that's almost certainly exactly what's happened because again it is what we've done right is we've we have the prince harry mental health talk to your chaps approach to mental health which basically says that he's the mental health veteran that what basically says that mental health issues are the product of sort of bad thoughts that just have to be countered by someone else by someone talking to you with a kind of end in mind some blokes have gone mental we need to bring those blokes back to health
1547.32 1558.38 SPEAKER_00  because honestly the number of blokes from the military who've gone mental is mental and we need to we're going to bring in open ai it's going to talk to those blokes it's going to check in on those
1558.38 1567.80 SPEAKER_03  chaps it never sleeps it never eats it never rests it just is constantly checking in on blokes that's right but and that but again not in a gay way although that's fine if it were to do that and i don't think
1567.80 1646.86 SPEAKER_05  it's capable of having a sexuality bings that is a computer as a large language model yeah um now again the as a very big boy language model as a bear language model um our area is open ai yeah so this is this is like one thing right and this is the marketing right which is the no we're not making we're not sort of creating uh let's say automated uh weaponry what we're doing is preventing veteran suicide and also exploring ways to synthesize intelligence but the problem is when you actually know how ai is used to synthesize intelligence in in war and i've done some looking into this as well what it actually it does is it is the ai system becomes almost inseparable for example from the artillery system so if you have a drone if you have drone spotted artillery right what will happen is okay let's say you're an artillery crew you have drone spotting right you have a certain number of times you can fire before you have to move right yeah and and so what the what the to guide that with ai what you're essentially doing is having the calculation of where you're going of your shot correction that kind of happens in in between the drone and the artillery crew and and the gun itself will automatically correct
1646.86 1669.36 SPEAKER_03  right i would be horrified at the idea that the gun would automatically correct just because of i mean just thinking about real life applications but so what you're basically saying is is this envision sort of uh a drone that kind of functions as a spotter yeah and that is able to tell them yeah okay like it like what you call an observer yeah i haven't done my because this is like the thing that i'm most worried having secretly been in the military in canada and done some ops done some
1669.36 1695.38 SPEAKER_05  black ops shit having spent a lot of time in the donbass with my uh with my wolf name the gun's correcting itself meanwhile we're having a rip yeah so any case how but then you say oh well no that's not an odd that no that's not part of the weapon that's part of the spotting but if the spotting is so integrated into the weapon then you say oh we're just doing intelligence synthesis when what you're really doing is in effect you're you've more or less automated a gun
1695.38 1722.90 SPEAKER_03  yeah i mean i i'm thinking about this kind of a thing at the end of it like you're gonna have to you number one i think like the kind of skeptic thing not saying it's not happening but rather looking at that application like that also introduces another point of failure into it also let's be real like if if this becomes integral and this kind of specific example then like the the obvious solution is for they'd fucking shoot the goddamn drone down and then make these motherfuckers
1722.90 1732.52 SPEAKER_05  do math because they're not they don't normally don't have to do that um i love it as it's that the teacher is like you can't use a drone on the test because why don't you don't have a drone we have
1732.52 1743.64 SPEAKER_01  got excellent plan we are going to force americans to do math they have only been to school three days a week and it was paid for by vendies mostly they were calculating number of burger naters you could
1743.64 1779.76 SPEAKER_03  fit in child i'm just imagining i'm just imagining this idea is like oh no like well but if you've automated the gun does that mean that like there isn't the capacity for like a crewman to come up and pull the lanyard and fire and so basically it's like oh no the wi-fi got severed between the drone and the automated gun it's like i realize that is also known as how the israeli military did its border wall but i don't think it's a very good idea and this kind of implies because i mean in thinking in my mind's eye of like how an automated thing would work to be able to fire a howitzer and then reload another one is going to be bigger than an autoloader in a tank
1779.76 1791.34 SPEAKER_05  so it's huge i'll tell you that again nikolai a very good news for you is the american artillery gun has gone walk which means it will not fire on us if we black up which fortunately we already have
1791.34 1824.70 SPEAKER_03  just for fun so well i mean like i i realize this stuff might exist and i might be just kind of spitballing and i could be very wrong here but i'm just thinking about i'm like to me uh i don't know it's just like after having used like radio systems that there's like oh it's super secure tactical it is like and it doesn't work and we're literally texting because it's the only way we can fucking communicate like this sounds like a disaster this sounds like a fucking nightmare i mean integrate it as a as a as a thing that you know that gives you an additional capacity fine but like the idea of having it all be kind of one thing that has to work together that's the funny
1824.70 1851.02 SPEAKER_05  thing the thing that makes it not an automated weapon system is that a guy still has to pull the lanyard and it's because otherwise open ai would be building automated weapon systems which it does not want to do yeah you don't want to do that and again it's not necessarily even open ai themselves that's doing this kind of activity but there are other similar ai companies that are offering this service largely to the ukrainian military oh good yeah dialing in the artillery in the gibbo group
1851.02 1856.24 SPEAKER_07  chat is a very funny idea just be like fire for effect and everyone's replying with like the penis
1856.24 1874.20 SPEAKER_03  picture i mean you know that that's a thing that happens in in troop group chats already and fire for effect then everyone drops a dick it's just like that's been done like that hypothetical example like someone listening is like oh yeah that was that was us last week it was a laugh anyway splash coming in
1874.20 1949.30 SPEAKER_05  three two one pictures of loads so this is the but if you want to think about like what this represents right it to me it represents it it represents the ongoing like the ongoing hollowing out now of the parts of the state that we don't like yeah artillery crews the backbone of the fucking state yeah exactly fuck those guys yeah but the the whole idea and again when i was watching um i was watching all the speeches uh sort of panel events at davos one of the um other uh sort of panelists was this guy mike rounds who's a republican senator from south dakota who was again saying like yeah we're the inventor of the bullet we're very excited to sort of introduce ai throughout the american healthcare system like the whole promise now and this is happening both in the uk and the u.s is just everything inconvenient every inconvenient person you have to deal with whether that's in a part of the state that helps you or a part of the state that blows people up um is just getting hollowed out it's a sort of i always sort of see a kind of the incorporation of ai into things as a kind of throwing up of the hands and saying well i guess we'll just sort of pray to the machine spirit
1949.30 1993.10 SPEAKER_03  about it but you've made this point before riley and i think it's a really good one which is that it doesn't have to be as good as a human it just has for the sort of deciders and and and sort of big power brokers it just has to be passably not shit enough to allow everyone to kind of kayfabe suspend disbelief and then it becomes the thing that decides and you know it's like i i've encountered this i don't want to list off the various indignities but i've encountered this so many times lately with things where automated systems fail and like this massively complicates a process that wouldn't be complicated if it just could be if if a human was the first oh yeah if
1993.10 1998.36 SPEAKER_06  you've ever dealt with every parcel delivery you will know this pain where there is not a single
1998.36 2015.84 SPEAKER_05  person you can speak to all you can do is email their ceo and and that's that's that's the dream right that's that is the dream represented by ai which is that the only person is the ceo and he is a he or she is able to just exercise their will yeah via a series of talking we're
2015.84 2025.48 SPEAKER_06  finally going to make ceos earn the fucking like you know 10 million pounds a year that they earn by responding to 15 million emails every day with people going where the fuck is my parcel
2025.48 2048.92 SPEAKER_05  before we before we move on the other thing i do want to sort of go back to is for a thing there i i never like to say ai is always bad for every there are some things that it's effective at spotting artillery seems pretty effective however the the concept of sidling into creating what is essentially an automated field gun is i i would consider to be very very worrying i mean i would
2048.92 2138.18 SPEAKER_03  say like thinking back on on on experience with stuff like this that if you had something that could for example take out the the initial confusion factor or even just having something that you didn't require a person to be piloting it all the time because that that's the thing with the kind of people talk about drones in the military but but but this may have changed but i doubt it just because you think of the size of these things typically when you have what they call uavs on unmanned aerial vehicles they're either very very large and they're like basically small small planes being piloted remotely from fucking nevada and they're you know they're huge or they are like way beefed up and way more expensive toys that are being used at the lower level where someone has to be trained up to pilot it and is constantly piloting it and like for example i remember the ones we use were susceptible to like really susceptible to radio interference for example it's where you just get the most autistic guy in your unit and you give him an ipad and then you're like figure it out brother and so uh what i would say is basically like yeah if you have a thing that then it can can competently function without having to be at someone's job you could see how that would be useful but i am i'm very weirded out just because like i don't know having encountered this so many times with with stuff both in in the military and then also later as this as this stuff proliferates in the civilian world where it's like it's shit and it it causes more problems than it solves and solving the problems it causes becomes a bigger job for more people than that original job that was just a
2138.18 2169.62 SPEAKER_05  guy's job oh yeah no we're like i know the future of jobs everywhere which is just kind of it's it's you're only going to be one skill and this isn't just for the places we're talking about this is going to be for everything which is how well can you get the thing to to spit out what you needed to spit out with the fewest number of corrections that will be required we're going back to a to basically a medieval church but where we're instead of asking god to produce sort of
2169.62 2174.72 SPEAKER_06  coordinates or respond to complete emails i think the top rate of tithes is too high
2174.72 2204.52 SPEAKER_03  feels though if i were just like the the the lowly backbone of society the individual artillery crewman i would be very uncomfortable pulling the lanyard on a howitzer and firing around that was completely targeted by the computer because as milo said i mean like if all this has been brought to you by wendy's how do you know that that drone hasn't just been programmed to spot i don't know a dairy queen that's for some reason in a combat zone and obliterate that shit and you're like oh yeah you know try turning over the blizzard now asshole my or my sobeliznovania
2204.52 2211.50 SPEAKER_07  they have destroyed our dairy queen there will be no ice cream cups for the men today
2211.50 2218.58 SPEAKER_03  yeah exactly we didn't realize that dave thomas would somehow rule supreme that uh yeah wendy's
2218.58 2228.72 SPEAKER_01  would simply exert its will in a way that's like weirdly lit pre-gaussian like pointing and looking directly into the camera yelling about the ukrainian nazis destroying the beautiful dairy queen
2228.72 2244.10 SPEAKER_05  yeah so so um i want to move on i want to move on to a new city that is being built it's not neom oh it's a new there's a new always new cities being built um that's right it is a it's a city within a
2244.10 2249.76 SPEAKER_02  city actually imagine a city within a city yes imagine a city it's really it's sad because when you first
2249.76 2263.88 SPEAKER_03  introduce these it's always like oh this is like like some you know jorge borges italo calvino shit and then it just winds up to suck like it's always just annoying and bad it's always like what have you lived in the airport lounge inside the line we're building the stick it's the vertical city
2263.88 2284.64 SPEAKER_05  it's one my way okay i'm sorry i'm too excited about this there is the 10th neom region was was announced but i'm i'm planning on talking about it on the bonus episode milo it basically is the stick oh okay awesome they know it's it's the line but into the ground like 1 000 sub basements
2284.64 2297.16 SPEAKER_03  oh you've you've conquered the world of business you have you know infinity money you know we've created the the the most luxurious destination for you know influencers around the world and it's like
2297.16 2303.70 SPEAKER_01  you get to live in hell yeah we took the world down there we'll we'll cover it on the bonus episode
2303.70 2338.40 SPEAKER_05  all right don't worry we are going to talk about the neom subscribe to the fucking all i will say is this i was kind of like on the fence and i'm going to say it again on the bonus episode i was on the fence about whether neon was back yeah right we're on the line i was i was like they haven't thought about something as cool as the line in a while they thought and then they were like coming back with like their new food city and they're like and their stage for like robot violinists and stuff i was like all right this is coming back and now with their new aquarium i think it's called
2338.40 2359.38 SPEAKER_03  the stick they're fucking back they're cooking again this is like when someone posts like a like a video capture of like you've given up on role-playing games decades ago but they're talking about like final fantasy 29 or something like that and it's just like this is the kind of stuff that gets mentioned yeah it's so back and i'm so excited to talk about all we need is a badly cgi'd video of
2359.38 2396.74 SPEAKER_05  michael owen giving you a tour of it and we're ready no this is a different city this is remember prospera oh the fucking the one in like panama the one in honduras yeah yeah yeah yeah prospera has decided that it is not sufficient it is its sovereignty is not sufficiently fragmented and has started a new sub city within it a pop-up city has started within prospera okay all right um called vitalia vitalia everyone is called vitalia so the invitation is to come and build the city of
2396.74 2421.92 SPEAKER_02  life uh is it a city where you fuck is it like is it someone saw that scene where you fuck is it that just most cities well well they saw the scene in that second matrix what's where they all like have that sex party and that city is actually down like oh zion in the matrix that's it yeah they saw they saw that and they were like what if you had a city but for sex uh-huh sex sexual city
2421.92 2427.78 SPEAKER_05  what if you had sexual city yeah yeah i guess the vatican was supposed to be the no sex city but
2427.78 2436.42 SPEAKER_02  then they had the banquet of the chestnuts yeah what if what if you had a city where you could fuck everywhere else everywhere else it's illegal but in this one place what you basically come up with
2436.42 2472.24 SPEAKER_05  is like the plot of the musical urine town but for sex basically sure why not um a combination of urine town and like that uh movie sleepers uh no vitalia has invited you to come build the city of life it's not for vitali and it's not italia right and it's not a city where you can fuck i don't think many of the people there are going to be fucking that much join the first 200 residents for healthy co-living and co-working we're starting a two-month pop-up city on the island of roatan to make death
2472.24 2484.30 SPEAKER_01  optional that's an incredible end to a sentence like up until that this could have been the blurb for just like any we work but like now now we're cooking what if there was a we yeah what if there
2484.30 2489.08 SPEAKER_02  was a we work that was a city and you weren't allowed to die in it make death optional is fun
2489.08 2493.40 SPEAKER_01  though because it implies that like they're not making death the thing of the past like you can
2493.40 2507.32 SPEAKER_05  still die if you want but there's an option to not which is a fun hinterland to be in so we're gathering 200 residents and 500 visitors in and near the prosperous semi-autonomous jurisdiction
2507.32 2519.84 SPEAKER_03  uh-huh i mean i don't know if 700 people is really a pop-up city i mean i feel it's like a pop-up hamlet conference yeah oh yeah pop-up village perhaps i'm sorry now i'm just thinking of like a
2519.84 2524.88 SPEAKER_01  game for really nerdy precocious children where it's like pop-up pirate but instead of a pirate in
2524.88 2576.64 SPEAKER_05  the barrel that you stick the fake swords into it's hamlet those are fake it's hamlet the danish prince so vitalia.city is a movement to start a longevity-based network society uh-huh we've talked we just have a normal society no i'm afraid we're having that we're having the one on the um on the caribbean island of uh of roatan uh that is in the other city that's kind of illegal um that's that was declared unconstitutional by honduras um that's now the subject of a big lawsuit where basically uh that brian johnson the strange man with the face with the weird face um brian brian jones town yeah the one who looks like um uh the one who's taken so many anti-aging treatments he looks like a haunted doll he is a celebrity in this in this pop-up city conference awesome okay that's
2576.64 2616.16 SPEAKER_03  good i mean at least at least 150 years ago when weird americans went to central america to create like their idealized vision of society like they wound up getting fucking executed by the british for i don't know piracy like i'm thinking of william walker and the you know the the kingdom of the golden crescent or whatever the what they call them uh filibusters you know when a guy from tennessee for some reason was in charge of nicaragua but this is just i don't know this is just we work this is just like i don't know trying to like hunger games we work and it i don't know anybody who would be attracted to this i don't know it's just it's so parochial and boring but also weird let me tell you
2616.16 2633.90 SPEAKER_05  uh they say they have decided to accelerate the process in longevity biotech uh fostering drug development at warp speed with four months to get to market instead of 10 years of testing to make death optional oh okay so well so death is death is sort of um it's optional but it's a possibility
2633.90 2639.48 SPEAKER_01  it's a distinct possibility oh boy take this pill will it kill you no i one time i one time made the
2639.48 2653.50 SPEAKER_03  mistake of picking out of active generosity picking up a hitchhiker on the island of hawaii who it turned out uh was a a disgraced former chiropractor who said he could do stem cell treatments and blinded a bunch of people with his weird injections he invented oh um and he was completely insane and
2653.50 2663.84 SPEAKER_01  said that uh he was going to build a former chiropractor is just such a funny like even in the world of chiropractors they were like nobody you're too weird and quack it yeah he he basically he's like
2663.84 2677.32 SPEAKER_03  i want to share you my art and it was just this incoherent fucking pamphlet and he said he was going to build a city floating in the middle of the pacific that was powered by the nuclear effluent from the fukushima disaster and also he said the holocaust didn't happen and that guy had a more
2677.32 2694.20 SPEAKER_05  cogent business plan than this well that guy that guy would be right at home here um yeah it might be there already we don't know fatalia is not just an intellectual exploration but a call to action all residents are also builders and are encouraged to set ambitious goals they've built builders
2694.20 2711.00 SPEAKER_01  they're all there everything is cash in hand that's right we're immortal what we we don't believe in gods we're no masters what we've done is we've built heaven on earth none of us will ever die everything's cash in hand we're outside the reach of the tax man build whatever we fucking want
2711.00 2716.88 SPEAKER_05  supported by pitch competitions crowdfunding and legal advice oh they're gonna need that
2716.88 2728.02 SPEAKER_03  of italia i'm just imagining again like a rogue colony of builders basically doing fortnite non-stop on a caribbean island just like yeah it's just like illegal extension at a right angle to an
2728.02 2816.16 SPEAKER_05  legal extension it defies gravity an international coalition force has to be sent in to finally defeat the rogue builder colony so vitalia's program is structured into four bi-weekly themes first longevity and human improvement right at least that makes sense right they said bioscience healthcare economics and so on sure the next one exploring the social aspect of cryptocurrency technology this is a life extension conference and you're like ah crypto we gotta have bitcoin involved for some reason people still doing this this is like going on about betamax in 1998 i forgot to include this uh but the uh another rachel reeves's other big uh thing from davos uh was welcome it was a big meeting with the coo of coinbase being like we encourage you to come to the uk awesome um you're like yeah perfect let's let's let's mark up that tree again now ai and technological process progress a deep dive into the potential of ai solving the problem of modern life in nearly all areas of industry that focus on the broader implications of this technology this includes an 80 year history of ai the final technology the final techno yeah we built god and so that's the final thing i see okay yeah every other technology will be invented by the ai we won't understand it and we won't need to because we're going to be the eloi basically but also like what what was the ai
2816.16 2819.80 SPEAKER_03  from 80 years ago because there's like what like a cuckoo clock they were probably talking about like
2819.80 2826.00 SPEAKER_05  the turing letter like the initial like idea that there could be this thing wait oh i'm sorry i i
2826.00 2830.44 SPEAKER_03  didn't realize it was serious i'm too fucking stupid and have never read a book so i do apologize we built
2830.44 2835.02 SPEAKER_07  the final thing of all god himself and now he's bent to our will but it turned out we had to build one
2835.02 2854.20 SPEAKER_03  more thing because he wanted an extension well you know what when god tells you to build an extension even if it's illegal do the same thing as the gun crew when the drone spots the fucking dairy queen let it rip he wanted cornucin i told him he had gone out of fashion it was a pain in the arse but he was quite insistent god insists you pebble dash his paradise
2854.20 2881.70 SPEAKER_05  so god wants to live in a fucking terraced house from britain in the 60s so uh benefits include healthy food available brian johnson's breakfast is going to be on offer brian johnson's breakfast um that sounds like a dandy warhol's album i'm sorry like what well you've made a right brian johnson's breakfast wait why would the day that's very funny the dandy warhol's would have made an album that was essentially the called the brian jones town
2881.70 2886.02 SPEAKER_03  breakfast because they're like in a fucking feud with them they hated them they hate each other
2886.02 2898.74 SPEAKER_05  yeah so healthy habits uh including saunas and cold plunges with accountability partnerships someone will bother hey you've not been doing your time in the sauna you just went to the sauna you
2898.74 2910.56 SPEAKER_03  didn't do the cold plunge come here big boy i'm telling self-experimenting this just be an orgy please like this is all just cover for an orgy for like a weird sex party like this is what a
2910.56 2925.92 SPEAKER_02  linkedin orgy that's it feels it feels like it feels like this wants to be a sex thing but it's because it's not it's like the most uncool thing well oh i hate the sauna accountability program i hate
2925.92 2937.04 SPEAKER_07  when my uncle sends a letter and says oh be sure to have two of the biggest men on the island drag him into the sauna and then hold him down in the plunge pool i suspect my speedos will come right off
2937.04 2942.42 SPEAKER_03  it's sort of like the the the the the converse of hussein's previous statement like you have in fact
2942.42 2960.46 SPEAKER_05  created the city where no one fucks no yeah uh this also includes self-experimentation and self-climical trials including gene therapy so yeah you can we've got this great chiropractor from hawaii he's gonna help us out yeah we're it's it's finally you're gonna be able to do like the race transformation
2960.46 2986.22 SPEAKER_03  therapy from die another day oh there's one other thing i remember i googled that guy's name and um not only was he a disgraced chiropractor but he was the landlord of an apartment building he'd never maintained and it collapsed into the ocean i'm dead serious awesome that is pretty sorry sorry to distract my asides but that's who i envision as the look overseeing clinical trials he flew in from his floating city in the middle of pacific powered by the nuclear affluent and he's helping build
2986.22 3005.42 SPEAKER_05  whatever this is yeah look this is why one of the many reasons why i always love a nate drop-in because we learn something like the chiropractic hitchhiker and it makes my life better for hearing it so um montessori school thomas pinch and novelas montessori school is available okay i'm just
3005.42 3009.66 SPEAKER_03  kind of an unassuming guy and i just encounter these fucking people and they start talking to me
3009.66 3031.36 SPEAKER_05  okay i can't help it it happens uh 100 crypto economy available if you want okay i mean that doesn't really make sense uh we will harbor renegade life scientists artists biotechnology engineers and entrepreneurially driven community of people who cherish you know you're losing your eyesight to the chiropractor that's a renegade life scientist
3031.36 3069.32 SPEAKER_03  it's just one of those things where it's like that's that's all i can think of when people bring this stuff up i don't know what it's supposed to conjure but to me it conjures up like the like i don't know the what is it the first element of umberto eco's thesis on on earth fascism it's like the sort of cult of the eternal like forgotten knowledge all knowledge is finite like you know healing crystals mixed with the gospels kind of stuff like that's what this seems like to me and it's like because i've encountered in real life and it's can be these can't be very dangerous people it's like i i just i'm like i don't want to be stuck on a fucking island that's hard to get to with these people like i've seen movies about this and they typically involve rutger howard as
3069.32 3089.92 SPEAKER_05  like a professional killer the thing to remember also about like prospera the thing that's like putting this on is that it is a sort of piece of like it's a strange sort of piece of directly administered stateless empire overseen by a hobsburg and a bunch of like latin american
3089.92 3113.04 SPEAKER_03  ayn rand acolytes but see that's the thing is that if it was a pinch and novel you would at least have the fake british invasion band called sick dick and the volkswagons with their hit single i want to touch your feet and it's like we don't get nothing is funny about like it's unintentionally funny but nothing is like it's not quite that absurd it's just i don't know like i don't want to sound like a broken record but it it it doesn't quite reach that threshold it just sounds annoying but also
3113.04 3157.80 SPEAKER_05  very unsettling so i want to finish up with uh with reading an article and like i promised we can choose our own adventure with this one um not you at home don't write it yeah you you don't get to choose your own you get to watch the twitch stream live gaming of the choose your own adventure book would you like to would you like to hear about andrew tettenborn's article in the spectator the tories have messed up the return to imperial measurements or that's a good it's a good start it's gonna take some beating or would you like to hear sam ashworth hayes write in the telegraph let's let amazon run the nhs to cut waiting lists i think oh i feel like imperial measurements is gonna be yeah i feel like that's a funnier one yeah
3157.80 3163.24 SPEAKER_03  what sucks is that i know that for thematically for our show we should pick the second but we got
3163.24 3176.24 SPEAKER_05  we got it we got it first right we got only these feckless only rishi sunak's feckless tories in name only uh could screw up the unfuck upable return to imperial measurements which should have
3176.24 3185.34 SPEAKER_07  been a triumph yeah tried to get a cubit of mdf the other they didn't even know what that was i brought i brought my son with a widest arm span along as well to get a good deal
3185.34 3198.76 SPEAKER_01  i was like it's like you're not even familiar with the works of the pharaohs i tried to buy a cubit of mdma all right your dealer just giving you a pill that's your entire
3198.76 3277.56 SPEAKER_05  arm span maybe take half first and show you feel me it's pretty strong stuff it's a very posh dealer as well yeah no let's talk about this cheers writes andrew tettenborn cheers to you andrew yeah you will soon once again be able to buy champagne and wine and pint bottles winston churchill's favorite measure also that wasn't winston churchill's favorite measure winston churchill's favorite measure was enough to kill me yeah minus a little oh yeah i surely he would be drinking like a nebuchadnezzar of champagne his favorite measure wasn't a pint of champagne it was 10 pints of champagne yeah but also wine bottles have always been the size that they are well they used to have options to have smaller ones you can why can't you have those now why can't you just decide i'm weird and british and i want a 568 milliliter bottle but a half bottle of wine is a little smaller than a pint yeah but the only thing i would welcome no one has ever done this the only thing i would welcome in terms of changing the measurements of how we do how we do drinks in the uk is related to my love for australia i love that there are so many options of beers you can get in australia a schooner is the perfect amount a pot a scooey yeah a long cock whatever that's not what's being proposed here
3277.56 3281.78 SPEAKER_03  no i'm from a country that uses imperial measurements and it's just i don't understand
3281.78 3288.24 SPEAKER_06  what this weird like it just seems inconvenient making wine in britain is a relatively recent
3288.24 3311.44 SPEAKER_05  development we've always imported wine so it's always been an international measurement so it will be possible for the first time since an overbearing common market essentially put an end to its practice in 1973 this is very good news and i'm certainly looking forward to drinking my first pint of fizz the ideal unit for one person over dinner jesus christ drink it out of a pint glass you
3311.44 3315.70 SPEAKER_03  stole from a pub too just just just do it yeah no one of those ones with a handle on it it's gotta be
3315.70 3338.56 SPEAKER_05  yeah um but but look further and any satisfaction may well vanish in much the same way the bubbles in your celebratory glass might in the same way as your wife does due to your drinking problem if you as the same way the bubbles in your celebratory glass might if you put it down too long how this whole affair of reintroducing imperial measurements has been handled is a horrible sign of a flailing
3338.56 3356.32 SPEAKER_01  tory administration that has lost its way but bringing back imperial measurements is a horrible sign of a flailing tory administration that's lost its way you fucking cretin you can't complain that the stupid policy that they're doing for no reason hasn't been done properly it can't be done
3356.32 3392.64 SPEAKER_03  also like you still use imperial measurements for stuff like miles per hour and distance like it's it's such a hodgepodge here in the first place you buy a pint of beer any pub like it's so we i don't know i like i get it i intellectually i get it that it's like grasping at this vision of lost imperial glory and whatnot but it's so stupid and petty and who cares like are you is it really gonna make people's lives better if it's like oh cool like like you said i buy mdf and it's one inch thick instead of what 25 mils like who fucking cares even though compulsory use of metric measurements
3392.64 3421.16 SPEAKER_05  in that twink even though compulsory use of metric measurements may have played a large if subliminal part in the brexit saga this is not an end to it it has merely become a small piece of gesture politics i hate the gesture how come they had a brilliant opportunity to bring back pints of champagne and yet they did just gesture politics with it crazy how did this become gesture politics i was
3421.16 3429.06 SPEAKER_06  excited for the meaty life-changing proposition of bringing back wine sold by the pint that was gonna
3429.06 3455.64 SPEAKER_05  have a real impact on people's lives outside the fairly rarefied area of still and sparkling wine the corpus of mandatory metrication remains the corpus of mandatory metrication fucking mars vaulter album right we still have the requirement to deal and count in metric units with everything else essentially for play only that's right you should have a soft play area economy andrew tettenbaum
3455.64 3468.24 SPEAKER_01  like who fucking cares yeah no one requires you to do fuck like you're a columnist you know you're a green grocer you don't have to measure stuff out for people if you want a pint of wine you can pour
3468.24 3493.06 SPEAKER_05  yourself one in your house and then deal with the consequences later so if your butcher weighs you out a pound of rump for old time's sake he must make it clear that any imperial units are for information only and less conspicuously marked on price labels and the like for those of us who fought to get rid of nonsense of this sort as one of the great dividends of brexit this looks like a piece of serious shortchanging
3493.06 3513.62 SPEAKER_03  i i buy meat from a guy like not like just a guy on the street there's a butcher up the street from us and it's like been there forever and ever and if i ask for a pound to just get a pound i typically if i ask for a pound i also get a diatribe i'm like i this country's going to the dogs kind of thing because fucking i'm american we use imperial units but like it's not as a no one's no one's jumping in and fucking doing like a disclaimer he's not allowed
3513.62 3522.02 SPEAKER_05  to say this like no one they have a woke blue-haired urocrat who's who says that who gives you the metric
3522.02 3530.78 SPEAKER_03  yeah yeah ursula londelion works in the butcher yeah yeah exactly yeah donald tusk is running the butcher
3530.78 3559.54 SPEAKER_05  on old kent road yeah exactly that's right um so all of this is a betrayal of what should be the tory principles of freedom and nurturing existing institutions the conservative case for leaving the eu is sound precisely because of the principle of the absolute supremacy of law related parliament blah blah blah blah blah my brother in christ the need to steamroller anything seen as an obstacle to the creation of a single market out of the way require the state to intervene to forbid us from using the system of weights and measures that we had grown up with who do you mean we but you
3559.54 3564.26 SPEAKER_03  you fucking use stone for weight who the fuck uses that outside of this goddamn country and i guess
3564.26 3569.94 SPEAKER_01  probably in ireland metric system in australia they use it in fucking russia they use it in
3569.94 3621.96 SPEAKER_02  canada my impression was that so you can just sort of say what you want like you can go to most places no no no no no no a blue a woke ursula von der leyen because like the market i go to which is run by like turkish turkish guys um they have they like they advertise all their sort of like meat and fish in kilograms but when people go to the counter there is like a good amount who'll be like oh can you give me a pound of this and they'll just be like yes that's what they'll say they'll say fish away they'll say they'll say yes they make the they make all the meat halal obviously you know to uh to troll around but like this yeah this sort of feels to me as it's like no you can pretty much go anywhere and use whatever type of like measure you want i don't understand this feels like the complaint if it is a sincere one because it is coming from the spectator and this is just the section where it's just like yeah just like kind of complain about something that probably i've invented a
3621.96 3627.02 SPEAKER_05  thing to be mad at the spectator is basically britain's complaints department for columnists
3627.02 3643.94 SPEAKER_02  give me a foot of chase you figure out well also but also for like you know this sort of like old guy who is like the only sort of constituency of people who did probably like vote because they felt that they could bring back imperial measures not because they're nostalgic about it but because
3643.94 3662.46 SPEAKER_03  it would annoy people well yeah because that's the thing this effectively what they want is everything in this country to go back to all imperial so they can just make it annoying for every other country that uses the metric system it's like do you think people are so fix it that they they're dependent on british stuff they'd be like oh damn woo the brits win again it's like no one cares may i read the
3662.46 3685.54 SPEAKER_05  next paragraph yes please it need not have been like this the government could perfectly well have announced this christmas that all metric compulsion in all matters of trade including the trade of champagne was to cease immediately it could have been put forward that as a natural consequence of brexit that the country should return to its pre-1973 situation that isn't why we use metric
3685.54 3705.22 SPEAKER_01  every cunt uses it the only countries that don't are america and mayanmar we're gonna we're gonna form an economic union it's gonna be us the us and my am i yeah i like those geezers over in rangoon they know what's fucking going on i tell you what you can get a foot of rice
3705.22 3712.86 SPEAKER_06  you can get you can get a cubit of rice wine and it's a good time but i like a good junta myself what
3712.86 3766.52 SPEAKER_05  i think is really funny right is one of the core elements of what you might call state formation right that when when states formed as they currently are out of like the feudal patchworks of land holdings one of the main things that happened that's the difference between states and pre things that were like states but pre-states was the introduction of commonly understood weights and measures in a territory which means if you're in france you can in whether you're in like brest or you're in like avenue a kilogram is a kilogram like that is one of the major parts of state formation and what i think is so amusing is that with someone like like andrew tettenbaum who's like one of these like you know wacky economists um it's sort of just without really understanding what they're doing in advocating for kind of like to throw the state formation process into reverse
3766.52 3778.94 SPEAKER_03  be like what do we have a lingua franca for yeah why why on earth is the woke eu forcing us to deny the existence of phlogiston all right every object contains fire within it and if you ask nicely enough
3778.94 3789.88 SPEAKER_07  it'll come out so what if the buddhist monks in myanmar are self-immolating in protest because you know how much petrol they used to do that a fucking gallon as god intended so such a measure would have
3789.88 3796.38 SPEAKER_05  shown a government that knew where it was going apparently to 1972 yeah at best it would and you
3796.38 3820.34 SPEAKER_03  know you know what you know i'm sorry to interrupt but i gotta say this you know how i know it's bullshit because no one is fucking saying undecimalize the currency they won't fucking go all out they won't actually do the real thing because they don't want to memorize they don't want to memorize that shit they don't want to learn what the fucking shillings and whatever like like it's like hexadecimal for your pocket money like no they won't do it it's all kayfabe so well he says uh
3820.34 3849.24 SPEAKER_05  switching to fully imperial measurements wouldn't even have involved a logistical difficulty after all electronic scales are just as happy in metric and imperial so why did this not happen we're told that in a public consultation 99 of people said they were fine with metric units but that consultation certainly doesn't appear to have been widely publicized in any case the result of any such exercise depends on the questions you ask if it acquizzed respondents directly on the essential issue whether people should be free to deal in imperial measurements who knows what the outcome
3849.24 3883.48 SPEAKER_02  might have been but that's how what it is right now you can go anywhere and you can basically use whatever type of measurement you want and it will broadly be fine like there will be certain times where maybe it's a bit tricky but you can for the things that you want you can go to a pub and be like can i have a pint of wine and the guy will look at you in a really weird way probably but we'll still give you a pint of wine yeah right i want i want a fucking brace of baby bells bring them to me you're getting angry at like something that you have already you can do this you can
3883.48 3887.82 SPEAKER_03  nothing is stopping you from going down to the pub and asking you can live your life this way you can
3887.82 3893.92 SPEAKER_02  go to a pub you can go to a pub and ask for a yard of wine or whatever the fuck like i don't understand
3893.92 3921.14 SPEAKER_05  what you're angry about i'd like i'd like one football field of cider please okay this is the last paragraph we with people like this referring to like kirstar and rishi sunak in the background perhaps it's not surprising that on issues of principle you're like the right to deal in the measures you prefer should play second fiddle regrettably regrettably regrettably whichever power whichever party is in power the technocrats are in charge i love that this guy's principle is
3921.14 3938.06 SPEAKER_06  just like being a lunatic like no we should make stuff complicated and difficult we should get rid of a system like the the argument for not bringing in metric measurements in the first place was like i'll be annoying for people to adjust to but we're now in a world where everyone has adjusted because
3938.06 3943.28 SPEAKER_01  it was like 50 odd years ago and so it would actually we'd go through the annoying adjustment
3943.28 3970.02 SPEAKER_05  period again in reverse in order to create a system that's less convenient perfect anyway i think that's all the time we have for today so i want to thank you for listening remind you that there is a patreon for five dollars a month for a second episode every week that's right and uh to check out about the stick yeah you can hear about the stick um and to you know check out uh milo in australia you can go to his website for his various tour dates oh yeah there's so many tour dates yeah also
