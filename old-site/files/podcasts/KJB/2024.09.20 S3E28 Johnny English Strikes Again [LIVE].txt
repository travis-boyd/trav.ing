Conway Hall, please welcome to the stage, Kill James Bond!
Kill James Bond!
I am November Kelly!
Yeah, get your fill. The last one for a minute or two.
It's fine. Joined as always by my friends Abigail Thorne.
Hello!
And Devon.
Thank you so much for coming out and thank you for being here.
Thank you so much for coming out and thank you for watching on the livestream if you are.
There are no more tickets available. There is no Night 4.
You have fucked it if you haven't made it to this one, frankly.
If you're on the way right now, forget it. Turn around. It's over.
Steve Coogan sadly doing a J-turn.
Rowan, it's not worth the speeding tickets!
Sadly doing a J-turn.
The morose J-turn.
Alright, well, I'm gonna be thinking about that the whole rest of the evening.
So, this is gonna be the weirdest one because we've had two nights to bed in a lot of jokes that are only funny to us.
Yeah.
I apologize in advance.
So, dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to recapitulate the 2011 film Johnny English Strikes Again.
To say farewell, to lay to rest a British icon.
Yeah.
Not really, because there's gonna be a fourth one.
Uh-huh.
Jonathan Englishman.
Oh, I'm sorry, were you not aware?
Yeah, they are making a fourth right now.
They're filming it, like, currently in Malta.
With an air of, like, active menace.
Yeah.
Like, the threat is never- it's like the terrorist threat level, right?
Like, it might be the risk of another Johnny English movie.
It's minimal, right? But it's never nothing.
We are.
We should always be prepared.
We are 30 seconds to Johnny English midnight.
Just the Robbie Williams alarm goes off.
If you see Rowan Atkinson, right, say something to a member of staff or British Transport Police.
You can text them on 61016.
See it? Say it sorted.
Together we can solve this menace.
It's not good to call it the English question, is it?
Well...
I don't think so.
But this movie- this movie, again, because these movies come out in lulls between Bond movies.
This one came out after Spectre, before No Time To Die, when they were still trying to figure out whether Craig could, like, stick the landing or not.
And obviously he couldn't. Like, it sucked. You were there, some of you, for the stress and space project for that.
But, in 2018, they made a third Johnny English movie. And my first note just says, why?
Hmm.
I feel the answer may be that Rowan Atkinson likes money and wants to make more of it.
Well, because the second one made- made so much money. It made, like, 120 million dollars.
Yeah.
It's crazy how much money these make.
Thanks to those damned Argentinians.
Yeah!
They were like, oh, this is profitable or whatever.
They don't have a Johnny Argentinian, right? So they have to-
I tell you what, that would not sell 100 million over here, though.
No, it would not.
It's a one-way relationship.
Johnny Argentinian, like, resurfaced after a few years after Johnny German disappeared.
Although, we never find out what Johnny English was doing before the events of Johnny English.
So, like, I want to see it. What was he doing in the Falklands War?
What was he doing? What was Johnny English doing on 9-11?
We don't know.
Now, English, your mission is to infiltrate Wesley Snipes' apartment.
It wasn't the plane. He just knocked everything over in, like, a madcap antic.
But, so, I complimented the last movie, right, by having a guy called Berne Gorman in it.
You might know his face if you don't know his name.
Hello.
Right. And I described him, and I sort of regret this, as a man who looks like a nasty little freak.
Right?
He does.
I said that they don't cast actors for looking like nasty little freaks anymore, and I said that this represented the decline of cinema.
I'm very sorry. This movie begins with Kevin Elden.
Guy I love to see.
Like, a veteran British comedy actor.
Yeah.
Nasty little freak I love to see.
Also, he's like 65 years old and does not look it. Like, my man is exfoliating. He looks great.
Well, he looks 30, but he looks 30 and like two weeks dead, is the thing.
Like, kind of recently exhumed.
That's what I'm going for.
Yeah, Dracula's ex-girlfriend.
Well, thank you.
But so, like, all of these movies seem to start with a close-up of some, like, horrible, nasty little freak's face.
And so, in the first movie, it's Rowan Atkinson.
Second movie, Rowan Atkinson.
Yeah, third one, Kevin Elden.
And he's like the kind of night duty officer at MI7.
And because of, like, technology and our modern ways of living, he's on his damn phone.
Yeah.
He's on his fucking phone.
Well, he's more than just on his damn phone. He's playing Temple Run.
Yeah.
He's playing the kind of...
2018.
He's playing the kind of games you get misleading ads for on Twitter.
And then, appropriately...
We are fucking under attack.
Exactly!
Play with me, my lord! Like, that shit.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, and they are fucking under attack, right?
They're under cyber attack.
We are fucking under cyber attack.
2018.
Listen, I'm not gonna say that this movie, or indeed any movie, needs to write, like, the IT accurately.
That would be the worst, most cinema-sins, ding, thing you could say about it.
Although we did get mad in fucking Spectre when Q didn't even airdrop his fucking laptop.
He just plugged that shit straight into MI6's mainframe and got a virus.
It's like, come on, man.
This is basically the same thing, functionally, in that a bunch of blue screens turn to red, and there's a bunch of, like, flashing angry messages.
That's how you know a cyber attack is happening.
Oh, no.
When the screen is red, you're dead.
If your screen turns red and starts flashing and says shit like, Agent Compromised, you're basically fucked.
You shouldn't have turned on Kaspersky just because it was blocking Chivalry 2.
Um...
It's...the firewall's really sensitive, but you still need it.
You want to be selective about this stuff.
Screen turns blue, good for you.
Screen turns red, agents are dead.
Screen turns red, agents are dead.
I...
I love the idea that this is some kind of down-home country almanac GCHQ wisdom.
Now I'm just a simple country GCHQ employee.
My grandpa happy told me.
Oh, my God.
But, yeah, so, like, they fucking get cyber attacked, and they have to wake up the Prime Minister.
And this is the first interesting thing about this movie, right, is that the Prime Minister played by Emma Thompson, woman I love to see.
That's right, that's right.
Woman I love to see.
And the thing is, this movie with satire, it hits a moving target.
Unintentionally.
Right, because 2018, they're aiming this at Theresa May.
But they try and, they aim for, like, Theresa May, but, like, what if she was, like, 25% dumber?
Yeah, yeah.
They're hitting, like, Theresa May, but she's drinking all the time, she seems really put upon, she seems really, like, stressed out by something.
She's blonde.
Can you imagine a politician like that?
I mean, someone...
Someone who's...
Someone who's everything about their character says, you know, the outfit says, stop the boat, but also I like to party.
Hmm.
Well, she's playing, like...
She's playing, like, out of her depth.
This button is holding on for dear life.
This is coming off at, like, terminal velocity and killing someone in the back row.
Well, she plays the Prime Minister's really, like, out of her depth and doesn't know what she's fucking doing.
Yes.
She lurches into the scene, like, like, freckles.
She's like, I've had six beta blockers and a large iced coffee.
She...
Her line is literally, like, I've had two bottles of wine and half a packet of sleeping pills.
What the fuck's going on?
Yeah.
Which I appreciate.
A little bit charming.
Yeah.
And it's Liz Truss.
It's so...
It's Liz Truss.
It accidentally hit that 30-day window.
It is a pitch perfect.
Some Truss fans.
It's crazy.
Yeah.
It's uncanny how much it's Liz Truss.
I appreciate that there's some Truss fans in the audience, you know.
Still here, still ride or die, in Liz we Truss.
Yeah.
I feel like maybe, like, a lot of our jokes, some of our jokes come from the movies we've watched.
Some of our jokes are sort of from outside sources.
And sometimes I feel like we need to explain what some of them mean.
Like, the Yamcha pose, for instance, or things like that.
Liz Truss was a short-lived Prime Minister.
Just in case...
She was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain of Northern Ireland for about 45 minutes.
And what she did was kill the Queen.
Something she had in... something she had in common with Johnny English.
Yeah, because the Queen isn't in this one.
Kill the Queen, right.
That means that the last shot of Johnny English 2 could plausibly be him realising he has killed the Queen.
Oh no, Johnny!
That's probably why they kicked him out of MI7 this time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's a real shame.
Yeah, kill the Queen, crash the economy, and then, like, obliterated about a thousand pounds worth of bathrobes.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, been there.
And then, and then peace the fuck out.
You know, she's at the fringe right now, living her best life.
She tried to do, like, a right-wing grifter thing over in America.
A while didn't work because she's got no charisma and no one likes her.
And now she's just doing self-care.
So she's like, Liz we trust, baby.
Yeah.
She's here tonight.
Did you say she's at the...
Did you say she's at the fringe?
Yeah.
She better be.
No, she is.
She posted a show?
Oh, she is?
No, she's going to other people.
Oh, okay.
I thought you meant she was doing, like, a 55 minutes above a pub.
Really?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Liz Truss, type five.
I can't say I wouldn't go.
That's true.
I absolutely would.
Hand on heart, I can't say I wouldn't check that out.
I would go on behalf of the transgender community.
Okay, so I know which one of us is getting arrested after the show.
I want to distance myself.
Yeah.
She's probably got some speeding tickets too, I reckon.
We're actually...
I can't.
I don't have speeding tickets.
I'm far too gay to drive.
Not you.
Liz Truss.
Oh, Liz Truss.
Yeah, you don't have any speeding tickets.
We're going to be pursuing, like, disciplinary action against Abigail Thorne for that remark,
which killed James Bond, LLC.
Buy me your drinks first.
So, because of the cyber attack, right, every agent has been compromised.
They've fucked MI7's cyberpussies.
And so, the Prime Minister is like, I don't care, I've got a bathrobe to soil.
Just get a guy who's so old that you have paper files for him.
That he's, like, pre-digital, right?
Back in the, you know, the halcyon days of, like, 2003, when nothing was on the computer.
Yeah.
So, we cut to Jonathan Englishman.
And he's in the woods.
He is, like, doing a pursuit, and the person that he's pursuing falls into a hole, which gives me the drop...
Where the fuck is it?
That is a first-class mantra.
Okay.
Which is a weird thing to say, but a weirder thing to say to a child.
Yes.
Because it turns out these...
We need to make him relatable to English people.
What's he doing?
Hunting children through the woods.
He's loose in the woods.
He's loose in the woods.
Because it turns out that, like, he's a teacher at this fancy boarding school, Hogwarts school for spycraft and torturing.
He's doing Jim Preeto shit from Tinker Tailor.
Like, it's... the references don't stop.
And he's teaching.
He's mixing in espionage lessons with his teaching.
And we see one of the ways in which he does this is...
Well, listen, I'll just give you the dialogue.
And let me tell you, this is the worst drop I've had.
And all told, there are five racist noises drops.
This is the worst one.
This is English to a classroom of...
I'd say, like, especially young children as well.
You're looking particularly beautiful tonight.
You're looking particularly beautiful tonight.
He's, like, training them how to be a spy, like...
This is a safeguarding issue.
It's a huge safeguarding issue.
It is.
You can't...
Like, if your teacher starts mixing in seduction class with geography,
eventually you may receive a medium-sized settlement from your school.
Mmm.
There'll be a real dick about it, but...
So...
Was yours only medium-sized?
I mean, there's so much about me.
Anyway, they...
They, um...
Not from where I'm sitting.
Again, this button is...
They call him in, back to MI7.
They're like, we need you back for one last job.
Yeah, and he's just like, fuck them kids!
Yeah, drops them instantly.
Instantly.
Out of there.
They'll manage.
Substitute teachers for the next six months, you know?
Um, and they get him in, along with three other old men.
Three other, like, kind of legends of the game.
Former agents.
And...
Man, this is the other thing, right?
Is if you know enough people, if you're famous enough,
you can just get people to be in your movie for one scene,
and just do whatever.
Fucking lame.
It's like...
He's got fucking Charles Dance,
Michael Gambon,
and Edward Fox!
Like, legitimately good actors.
What are you doing?
To be...
Have you spent all the money?
It's like going up to Edward Fox, being like,
Hey man, love Day of the Jackal,
love your weirdly unsettling horse-sized teeth.
Um...
The accent's still sexy, even though you're like 90 years old.
Um, do you want to be in my, like, sequel to a sequel,
where you play the silliest, oldest cunt in the world?
And Edward Fox is like, yes!
Just texting Brandon Rogers right now,
saying, gonna edit you out of Dracula's ex-girlfriend.
Yeah, my own note is, how embarrassing would it be to keep just like,
name-dropping people you know?
Uh, but, so these are the kind of...
No, we, we, no jokes.
We thought about reaching out to Jared Leto.
Taking a break from the kombucha business.
No comment.
Um, so...
These are the kind of chads to Johnny English's Virgin, right?
Mm-hmm.
Because he, he shows up in his, like, tweed jacket in his shit old car,
and all of these guys are like shaggers, you know?
Like, just because they're old.
They're like, I've got the, the exploding stun grenade pen
from, from my old spy days, and I'm gonna use it to fill out this form,
uh, and to play kind of chicken with the timer, you know?
He takes the cap off, and it's like, it's on a 20-second timer.
He's like, hovering over the thing.
Can you see what happens next, right?
It's a, it's a joke for the world of foreshadow.
He sets off the fucking stun grenade.
Yeah, he sets off the stun grenade.
It's, it's, I don't know, it's kinda cute though,
cause he like, drops the pen, he like, bumbles it into the T's.
He's got 20 seconds to find it.
And then like, he, he can't find it in time, so he just leaves the room and closes the door.
We hear, we hear the stun grenade go off, and then when the MI7 people open the door,
these three old men are just like, knocked out asleep, and he's like, oh, they all dozed off,
and that's how he gets the job.
It's kinda, it's kinda cute.
Six ruptured eardrums.
Um, also the thing I like about this is, as he's trying to find the stun grenade, like, timer thing,
Chell's Dance, gives him the Chell's Dance classic, right?
Which is, every role he's ever been in, it's, uh, the direction seems to be,
strain as hard as you can not to call the guy in front of the camera the F slur.
So he's just looking at him like...
You know he's thinking it.
So he incapacitates all the other agents, and they're like, oh, well, I guess this is the only one left, you know?
Yeah, and like, the new Pegasus, he's a bloke this time.
Yeah, Gillian Anderson, fucking dead, retired.
Well, yeah, she got, she got fired after Johnny English killed the Queen in front of her.
So he's like, they were like, you've gotta get out of here.
Yeah.
Um, but he's like, who are you? And it's like, well, this guy was the king of England briefly.
Like, a couple of years ago.
Yeah.
You think some of the students might know that, instead of being on their phones.
No, but...
It's like, yeah, my English...
You're gonna have to learn his name!
Like, when I went to school, right, it was special if a teacher had a doctorate,
or, like, taught you seduction classes, let alone if he was a fucking knight,
and my geography teacher, Sir Johnny English.
Yeah, my geography teacher, King Johnny the First of England.
Like...
I'd mention it, I don't know.
Also, like, do the people not know he attacked the Queen?
Like, what's he...
If you were the monarch and attacked the previous monarch, like, that's...
That's news, surely.
Yeah, you could have done a history for that shit.
Yeah.
They gotta put that in the papers, surely, right?
But so, they recruit him again, and they're like, we need you back for one last job.
And weirdly...
Again.
At this point, he goes...
Because he gives them a list of shit he needs, right?
Like, I'm gonna need the fucking T2 exploding banana, or whatever.
I'm gonna need the, like, rocket-propelled brogues.
I don't...
But then, he goes, and I'm also gonna need a boff.
And I'm like, what the fuck is a boff?
And I have the fastest and briefest run of Stockholm Syndrome I've ever had in my life.
Because I'm like, oh, okay, so the main guy's a daft old bastard now.
And we're going back to the first one again.
This is just more Bond stuff, you know?
Yeah.
Like, I appreciate someone willing to depict themselves as, like, a stupid old cunt in general, right?
Like, it's why I was writing for Biden.
Um...
But so...
He takes them back to the shitty office he started Johnny English one in.
You know, it's like when a video game does that.
It's like, oh, it's the tutorial level again, but you've leveled up a bunch of times, you know?
How you can take out Ben Miller really easily, what?
Yeah, I guess so.
Um...
And Ben Miller is there, looking older.
And he's back in this movie.
I guess, like, Rowan Atkinson forgave him for being funnier than him.
He's...
I mean, there are strict conditions.
There are, like, bail conditions on that, because he's not in this one.
Like, he's not funny at all in this one.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's...
He's not funny in this one.
They must have, like, not allowed...
He's got an ankle bracelet on, like...
Yeah.
The surgically implanted suicide squad bomb into the back of Ben Miller's neck.
It's like, if you overshadow Rowan's physical comedy one more time, it just detonates the top of your head.
If it, like, if the tag hears laughter, it just, like, administers the cyanide and kills him.
Let me tell you this for fucking free.
It would be easy to overshadow Rowan Atkinson's comedic chops in this fucking movie,
because he doesn't do any jokes.
It's true.
They kind of forget to do that.
He just does crap balls.
I guess maybe the alternative is...
The alternative is that transphobia makes you not funny anymore.
It's plausible.
It's very true.
Maybe that's what happened to Ben Miller.
It rots your brain.
No, to JK Rowling.
Hasn't apologised for signing that open letter.
You can apologise any time, Ben.
But for the moment, right, Ben Miller is here.
I'm laughing.
I'm clapping like a seal.
I'm an oaf.
Like, I'm just like, yeah, this is kind of funny, I guess.
They have the kind of...
The 24-7 total power exchange DS relationship that exists between English and boff is back in full swing.
Yes.
It's like the Duke of Burgundy.
It's like cyclical, right?
Like...
He's nice.
The day starts over again.
English is drinking a lot of water.
Um...
His boots are looking real shiny in this film.
But so, boff's like, I'm so glad to be back.
We've got to do the Q scene now.
Q from the last film?
Also not in this.
Gone.
Dead.
No, Q is now woke, soy, gay.
He's gay.
He's twink.
He's double-twink.
This is the twinkest Q I've ever seen in my life.
They try to do the Ben Whishaw twink Q thing.
Which, first of all, implies that English like killed the last Q by tipping him out of his own wheelchair.
Yeah, we don't see him again after that, so...
That's a good point.
But also...
This guy is a little wake of destruction behind him.
Yeah, yeah, no kidding.
But also, the like, Q branch looks like an Apple store now.
And they have like a twink in a sweater who's clearly parodying Ben Whishaw.
Except, at least they let Ben Whishaw be Q, right?
Like, they didn't rename him to the R like John Cleese, right?
And this guy is P.
He has a big little like P lapel pin.
Yeah, he's the port-a-master.
Like, Q comes from something.
Like, it's...
The one joke I wrote for this whole series of live shows, and the funniest one, is about this very thing.
I'll get there.
Oh, fantastic.
Before I do, right?
English is like, uh...
I don't...
It's all like phones and shit, right?
Yeah, this is where the movie begins.
It's like, everything is gay now.
Yeah.
Fully serious, like, boomer particle.
I think I have the drop here.
There's a Twitter handle, Instagram feed, and secure login for the department Uber account.
What's he on about, Buff? I need a weapon, not a box of gobbledygook.
Yeah, I couldn't understand it either.
Like, the tannoy at London Euston.
Because he tries to give him his gadgets, and it's like a phone, and he's like,
Oh, does it explode? Is it a stun gun? He's like, no, it's a phone.
And he's like, oh, have you got anything else?
He has to, like, ask for a gun, and, like, P fully tells him.
We... don't really do... guns... anymore.
Which is... at the most...
Very plaintive.
Yeah, it's quite like... well, at least now we know what the P stands for.
Pussy.
Faggot.
Inventing the...
Oh, I thought you were just calling me that.
We're pursuing strong disciplinary action.
Um...
Inventing the PH slur on the stage of the ethical society is a real career high point for me, I have to say.
To thine own self be true.
But so...
But so...
But so P is like, alright, well I can give you a gun, but I'm gonna need to do some health and safety jokes first.
Um...
2018 this came out. Like, the health and safety shtick was old by, like, 2013.
They did it in the last movie. They had Pegasus be like, MI7's weapon is dialogue now. In the last movie. Like, it's a perfect metaphor for this kind of shit. Because it's... it's purely imagined. There was never, like, a pre-lapsarian MI7, right?
Because even if Johnny English won, it was like, it was too woke for him, you know?
Well in many ways Johnny English is a man out of time.
Mmm... This is... this is true. Um... But so he has to give him the whole health and safety spiel. Part of which is, um... It includes the phrase, any agents with nut allergies. And I love this idea that allergies awoke.
Yeah.
A fucking soy boy collapsing on the floor from anaphylactic shock.
Just looking for attention. Your special injection pen.
Like, I'm pretty certain they used to have those and people just died at, like, birth of them.
Yeah, I mean, occasionally you see people like, oh, when I was a kid, like, there was no genders, and, like, nobody had any allergies, and nobody had any mental health problems, and it's like, yeah, everyone ate peanut butter and died or killed themselves or had a drug addiction.
Yeah, these days you can only die out of eating peanut butter if you had to, like, press a manger. Like, it's...
A little health and safety joke for you there. Um, also, as far as these things go, I think that if you're gonna do it,
a health and safety spiel for issuing someone with anything, a gun should be, like, on the list, right?
Yeah! Like, I want the guy to get a health and safety briefing about the gun, maybe.
I also... I mean, if only he has a test of his patience, I feel like you shouldn't be able to get a gun unless you can tolerate some degree of bullshit.
The mandatory three-day waiting periods kind of thing? Yeah! Yeah!
It's just... I mean, like...
It's a fucking 23-year wait for gun now, it's awful! Yeah, it's bullshit!
It's alright, you can always source your own... don't wait, no, okay.
Cut the stream! Cut the... cut this!
Okay. We're pursuing strong disciplinary action against me, later, I hope. Um...
We're probably doing, like, drinks at the pub around the corner. Um...
So, they give him the gun, and they give him the health and safety thing, and they, since this is 2018, presumably go,
by the way, you're now legally immune from any consequences of using this on anyone. Um, and then...
Yeah. You gotta give him the car.
Alright, well, okay, so... Oh, God.
Guns are gay. Right, no, not guns aren't gay. Phones are gay.
Phones are gay. Phones are gay.
Phones are gay. Phones are gay.
Health and safety's gay.
Yeah, true. Having not allergy, that's gay, first of all.
Yeah. Um, what else is gay? Electric cars.
It's true. Because...
They take him into...
Are you joining us, Mr. Clarkson?
They take...
I see you made it here after all!
They take him into a big hangar, full of, like, silver and grey electric cars.
Yeah. Which would, like, blend in most places in, like, Britain, to say the least, probably in Europe.
Be a good car for a spy. Very economical, doesn't attract a lot of attention. Quiet. Uh, you know, lets you creep up on people.
And they... The punchline is, you can take any hybrid you want, and you get an unironic, like, boomer disgust look off of Rowan Atkinson.
There's not even a joke here, he's just like, ugh, gross.
Aw, the planet's gay!
And so, instead, he...
Eh! Gay!
Yeah.
He pulls a tarpaulin off of the real star of this movie, which is a red, Aston Martin V8 Vantage.
Beautiful red Aston Martin V8 Vantage.
Now...
I mean...
We get some fawning shots of that V8 Vantage, because this man is a car guy.
Yeah.
He doesn't give a shit about the rest of us.
Yeah, but he fucks them.
Yes.
Sex with these cars.
Yes, and he sped with them several times.
Yes.
Like, criminally, in fact.
Yeah.
Yeah, he's dodging those tickets.
It's fucking crazy.
Anyway.
We can...
We can...
We can disavow all of this, Lacer.
I mean, this isn't...
It's not the color I'd want, but this is the car I want.
It's a nice car.
It's really nice.
They've figured out that they need it to not be a fucking, like, Bentley or some shit.
It needs to actually be, like, a car that maybe your dad could buy.
Mm-hmm.
Well, this is the car that Rowan Atkinson did buy.
Yeah, obviously.
Like, because he's a car guy, because he's a Top Gear guy, it's his car.
He, like...
They kind of made the movie around...
I don't want any more.
He just wants cars.
He literally just wants cars.
Like, he's only making this...
Take it back.
He's only making this fourth movie because he's imagined another car he wants.
Yes!
He's like, fuck it.
I could probably get him.
It's like us live shows in outfits, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Like, there's a very clear chain of causation, and it's very selfish.
We're not thinking big enough.
Clearly.
We gotta think so much bigger.
Yeah.
I mean, but so...
The movie's really, like, filmed around this car, this horrible car.
We had someone in who worked on this movie last night.
Yeah.
Who came up to us and said, I have been in this car.
I think they even drove this car.
And was like, it's shit.
It's a terrible car.
But the movie is like, this car fucking rules.
It was the last car made before England got neutered by the woke soy gay agenda.
Well, all these cars, like, these classic cars, they look really nice, but then you get in them and it's like riding around in a fucking hangover.
Because they're loud and they're hot and they're cramped.
It's a lot like me.
Yeah.
It's terrible.
Which is why I would offend Rowan Atkinson even more by getting one, gutting it, and putting an electric engine in it.
Just to piss them off.
Nice.
It's just, it's a really ugly variation on what I, like, my favorite Bond car.
Like, I like this car in The Living Daylights where it's painted black, but he's painted it red and it's horrid.
It's like really, I don't know, gauche, I guess?
The textual excuse for this is that they're dealing with, like, a hacker, right?
Yeah.
This is a cyber crime guy.
A cyber crime guy.
So we need to go low tech.
We need to get, like, an old fucking petrol belching car.
We need to not bring a smartphone.
We're going, like, analog.
Pure analog.
Yeah.
We need a guy.
We need the last guy we have who doesn't have pronouns.
So, it's just, it's just desperately pathetic.
And the thing is, something we've noticed across these movies is that, decreasingly,
Rowan Atkinson is able to resist making himself look cool or trying to.
Like, the first movie, pure oaf.
He's, like, running into walls and shit.
Second movie, the oaf has been cut a little bit.
It's been, like, 30% of, like, Chad.
Right.
So, like, he can put on, he can, like, parachute onto a snowmobile, but he can't put on trousers, right?
Um, this movie, they forget the oaf.
They just forget the oaf.
He's literally just good at everything.
He's just cool.
He throws the smartphone out of the car window into a bin, and it's, like, what, like, that's not funny.
Yeah.
You're too competent.
This is the guy who, in the first film, like, threw his coat to try and land it on a coat rack and, like, went out of a window and killed someone.
Straight out of the window, yeah.
That was a funny joke, like.
This is the guy who killed the queen.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Although, even in the first one, he managed to pull a J-turn off in an Aston Martin.
Yeah.
And instead, it's just, like, throwing, full force throwing a phone into a bin.
It's just like, okay, man.
It just doesn't marry up at all.
Like, the description on Amazon is, like, everyone's favorite accidental super spy or whatever.
And it's like, no, he's not.
He's not at all.
That's not him.
He's just, he's just doing this shit.
He does a, like.
He's just an actual spy at this point.
Yeah.
He does a non-morose J-turn.
Like, a kind of a jubilant J-turn.
This is what the J stands for.
And, like, peels out the thing.
I guess you would be jubilant after you hit a J-turn, you know?
I might be jubilant, yeah.
I think I'd be, like, perfectly, like, ataraxic.
I would maintain, you know?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I would be in a kind of state of total equilibrium, you know?
I would be like, I accept that the J-turn has happened, but it's now in the past.
I'm thinking about the J-turn to cut.
Yeah.
I would be like, nothing but J-turns.
This is true wisdom, you know?
What's it called when you do the opposite of a J-turn?
Uh, uh...
I guess that's an L-turn.
It's gotta be an R-turn or something like that, right?
Just be doing that all the way.
Yeah, yeah.
I hope you enjoyed me trying to figure out what a reverse J was with my fingers.
I, my love, I also did that.
Bear in mind, we do, we sign merch after these.
I've had two nights of it, and only at the end of last night did I figure out what my signature was supposed to look like.
She was so proud of it, though.
It's pretty good.
You should check it out later by getting her to sign it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hang out afterwards.
I'll sign your, uh, I'll sign whatever, to be honest.
Anyway, um, Ben Miller says, uh, Rowan Atkinson, our next location is a luxury hotel in the south of France.
Before they do, they have gadgets.
They set a couple of the gadgets up.
Oh yeah, sorry, yes.
They have little gadgets.
Uh, they have, uh, a bunch of, they're largely candy themed, right?
Yeah, what?
And like old candy, because candy used to not be woke.
Oh!
Yeah, like non-woke candy.
Yeah.
Like old style curly-whirly or whatever.
Right.
Yeah, before they, before they made the curly-whirly soy.
Yeah.
You know.
So they've got like a sherbet fountain, which if you, if you're old enough to remember what a sherbet fountain is,
Jesus Christ.
It's time to, it's time to go to the light.
It's time.
It's time.
Like it's, it's over.
You're like done, you know?
Um, but the sherbet fountain or whatever is like a transmitter.
Yeah.
And they've got a packet of like old packaging jelly babies.
Not sure why it has to be the old packaging other than like for boomers to go, yo, I remember that.
You know?
Genuinely believe that's the case.
It used to be called a marathon bar.
Um, and so Ben Miller's about to eat one of these.
And he goes, I wouldn't because the jelly stands for gelignite.
And if you ate one, you would like blow your entire head off and the roof of the car.
Hmm.
Much like if you were funnier than me at any time in this movie.
There are two in your shoes, Bob.
Activated by this button.
Ben Miller's like approaching a joke and you can hear the beeping get slightly louder.
What?
But so they got to drive to the south of France.
Yes.
Because they're like, well, we want to have a next location, but we don't want it to be somewhere that's like difficult to access or like uncomfortable for us to stay in when we're not on camera.
So it's a luxury hotel in the south of France.
Yeah.
Oh, they've got, they've also got a pair of, they've got like high energy pills and knockout pills.
And they're in the same vial, but they're different colors.
And they go, I see what you're going to do with that.
Yeah.
And so Ben Miller's like, so the cyber attack was launched from the hotel Wi-Fi at this luxury hotel.
And we've checked out all the guests and we found that one of them is like a former mercenary guy called Sebastian Lynch.
Right.
And so they go to the hotel and they find him.
And I'm like, if I was launching a cyber attack from hotel Wi-Fi, I would have left shortly after doing that.
I wouldn't.
Yeah.
I wouldn't stick around actually.
Yeah, but what they do is-
If I was committing a crime using someone's Wi-Fi, I'd be leaving shortly afterwards.
We're getting straight on out of there.
They-
Just checking something.
Yeah.
How's that torrent going?
Um.
Just, do you have a YN gun on the internet actually?
Yeah.
Like it's a bunch of STL files.
I don't recognize that file extension.
Um, but so-
Oh, I'll run as administrator.
Fuck it.
We'll see.
Yeah, we've got a 3D printer running back there.
It's almost done.
If the live show goes badly.
Mm.
No!
None of you are making it up!
Yeah, starting with me.
Um, so-
No.
No.
I love the bit where we threaten to kill our audience.
I-
I was surprised they laughed at that, but it worked.
The number of Abigail Thorne credible death threats up to two this evening.
He's gonna shift my chair a bit further away.
We get very confident on the third night.
We get very confident on the third night.
It's getting real cranky when I don't have dinner before we do the show.
Um, anyway.
Uh, they see this guy.
He's having dinner.
He's having dinner.
His phone's on the table, which is very rude.
So they disguise themselves as waiters and decide to do French accents.
Yes, yes.
Jesus Christ.
Bear in mind-
This is a fucking bullshit scene.
Bear in mind-
The Archbishop of Canterbury.
That's our standard for French accent in these movies.
They manage worse.
It's-
Genuinely, it's like 40 Towers level shit, right?
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
It's just like-
Ben Miller and like Rowan Atkinson lightly debasing themselves by doing a shit French waiter act.
Um, it's-
It sucks.
I'm sure it sucks.
They didn't need the accents though, because the bit where somebody says to him like,
Oh, could you take the shell off my lobster is quite funny.
But he like doesn't-
He doesn't know how to do it because he's not a real waiter.
And then he like tries to flambe some prawns and just like sets fire to the whole fucking restaurant.
But see, this isn't really oafish.
This is like in the same way, by the same token as in the second one, like flying a helicopter badly is like not an oafish thing to do.
Like fucking like skinning?
Question mark.
A lobster.
What do you do to-
What do you do to a-
I'm going with D-Shell.
D-Shell.
D-Shell, yeah.
Do they have-
Okay, fine.
D-Shell, yeah.
Whatever it is you do to a lobster, right?
D-Yeah.
D-What did James Bond do to that lobster?
Um, what-
Also, hang on a minute.
What fucking restaurant is serving you a lobster and not cutting it in half for you?
Like-
We have a sort of a gulf of experience here.
D-I-
Quite, quite genuinely.
D-Your objection here is like all the times I've eaten lobster that's never happened to me.
And my experience is I have never eaten lobster because I'm too scared of-
D-Genuinely.
D-them having to like de-vein it.
D-Even if you order a whole one.
D-them having to exsanguinate the fucking lobster.
I don't-
It's going to be a whole thing.
How is everyone else doing anything?
D-Someone else has to do it for me.
It's embarrassing.
I don't want to do it.
D-ave me if someone asked me to like de-shell a lobster, I would kill myself on the spot.
Like there's just, like no way.
D-Yeah, you just have to like, I'm 3D printing a gun-
D-en the back of the restaurant.
D-N-O.
D-no, on there, wifi.
D- When it says wifi for customers only,
I was taking that very literally.
D-No, even if you order a whole one, they should cut it in half,
they should bisect the lobster and then give it to you along with the tools to pick the lobster-meet out.
D-Like when they quadra-sect the lobster.
D-It's still pretty hard from that point.
D-It is, yeah.
D-It's a difficult food.
D-It's a tough food.
It's a tough food!
Cafe with a chalkboard up that says,
no Wi-Fi, bring a gun like it's 1979.
Bring a real gun.
It's really anti-3D printing.
Prefer an analog gun.
Real old school.
It's this app shit.
It's like a flintlock pistol or that.
Yeah, this is the only thing that still works against
the cyber attack, you know?
So, yeah, they set the restaurant on fire.
They grab this guy's phone on the way out.
They go through it, and they find
that in the background of one of this guy's
selfies with his wife is a yacht.
The yacht is called the dot-com.
Calm is in, like, ataraxia.
Again, like, emotional equilibrium, right?
Except the way that Rowan Atkinson
pronounces the word calm...
The dot-com.
The dot-com.
The dot-com.
Ben Miller has the idea that, oh,
whoever was on the yacht could have parked the yacht
outside the hotel, used their Wi-Fi,
and then just sped away.
Which is not...
The guy...
Like, I guess this is a kind of good representation
of British intelligence, because they did
burn down an entire restaurant to hack the phone
of a completely innocent man.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I also swear to God, like, this guy doesn't come back.
Like, he's not connected to this in any way.
No, he's just...
This is theft.
This is crime.
Well, not since the covert human intelligence sources.
Yes, that's very true.
But, yeah.
It was also legal when Johnny English fucked him.
Being enticed into a relationship with Johnny English.
Horrible.
I mean, I guess that's just Rosamund Pike in the last movie,
you know?
Yeah, she...
To be fair, she left him pretty too sweet
after he killed the queen in front of her.
Yeah.
Yeah, she did not stick around for this.
Well, I mean...
Not many relationships would survive that,
I don't think.
Rowan Atkinson must have some kind of riz
because he dated James Acaster's girlfriend.
Famously.
He did, yeah.
He cucked James Acaster.
Feeling...
Insecure?
I guess?
Rowan Atkinson is not stealing your wife.
Like, there's no way...
Fucking better hadn't, you know,
because I'll 3D print the shit out of something
if he tries.
Like, I...
Incredible death threats counter to...
Zero, surprisingly.
All of mine have been to myself thus far.
Okay, sure.
And I guess every old person in the world.
We count those.
I'm pretty certain.
But so...
Oh, Christ, what happens next?
We get another Thompson trust scene.
I wrote Emma Watson,
which would have been a much better film,
but yeah, the Prime Minister Emma Thompson...
Is it called the cut scene?
No, no, a trust scene.
Oh, okay.
I thought you were, like,
playing it as a video game
and just, like,
why do none of the controls respond to it?
No, I'm afraid.
I'm afraid.
Just, like,
sitting in front of Johnny English
with an Xbox controller,
just like,
this cut scene is long as hell.
This is long as hell.
Were there any Johnny English video games?
Metal Gear Solid S.
Huh?
Someone said yes automatically out there.
Which implies to me,
but not only do you know that it's true,
but you've played it.
If they made a video game,
that's terrifying information.
And also,
if you're playing Johnny English,
the video game,
if you fuck up,
do you win or lose?
2003.
It's a very philosophical question.
Forget the tube.
Get the fucking tube.
3D printing a tube.
The Prime Minister
is watching a presentation
by Jason Volter,
who is a tech billionaire,
the CEO of Volter Tech.
Yeah, he's fucking Elon Musk,
Mark Zuckerberg.
Elon Musk pre-Brainworms.
Brainworms.
Yeah, yeah, 2018.
And, like,
Mark Zuckerberg post
getting ripped as well,
because he's, like,
muscles,
black t-shirt,
and his deal is to, like,
disrupt,
move fast and break things.
Tech guy.
Yeah, and he's like,
we could, like,
do algorithms
and make any
shitty,
backwards,
second-rate country
into a world power again.
And she's like,
that's Britain.
That's what we are.
We're shit.
We're shit.
It is very funny.
It's so Liz Truss.
Yeah.
It's really funny
that she does just
immediately fall for this.
Yeah, absolutely.
It's 100% Liz Truss here.
And so she's like,
get this guy
to Downing Street
where I will put
the moves on him, right?
Yeah.
And we'll go through
some bath robes
or whatever.
And Britain's going to be
back on top.
She says this to Amit Shah,
who is playing a man
who is very clearly
supposed to be, like,
a Rishi Sunak stan.
Yeah.
It's wild.
This is pre-COVID Sunak,
2018.
This was back when
he was just, like,
a fresh, fresh,
piece of shit,
cunt, motherfucker.
Like, before he, like,
properly kicked off,
you know?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Still the richest guy
in Parliament at that point.
Yeah, but it's, like,
the technocrat guy.
Yeah, exactly.
The guy with the clipboard
kind of thing, you know?
Like, being Liz Truss's sidekick,
which is not how that works out,
as it turned out.
There is a really funny moment.
There's been another cyber attack
and Pegasus says
every flight in Europe
has been rerouted to Luton.
That is funny.
The disgust in his voice
has been rerouted to Luton.
It's so fun.
The thing is,
they do this joke again.
There is another cyber attack
and they do the line,
every train in England
has been rerouted
to Bristol Temple Meads.
I'm sorry,
Bristol Temple Meads
is not the Luton of train stations.
Bristol Temple Meads
is a nice station.
It's a lovely station.
It's a great station, folks.
We've got some Bristolians in.
The mayor of Bristol
are here tonight,
ladies and gentlemen.
But yeah,
so she gets them
into Downing Street, right?
Yeah.
Meanwhile,
English and Bof
are in the south of France
and they've got to get
on board this yacht.
So, first they use
the shoebox inflatable,
which is a funny pair of words,
allegedly.
And they get, like,
full, like,
rubber inflated
against the car.
It's, like, sick.
It's really sick shit.
It gets quite dark.
Google Johnny English inflation
if you want to see
a screenshot of that.
It's not, like,
this movie's rated, like,
PG.
It's, oh, no.
They use magnet boots
to walk up the side
of the yacht.
Yeah,
and those magnet boots
are powerful enough
to, like,
move all of the cutlery
in the kitchen,
which means,
functionally,
you're just giving
everyone in the yacht,
like, a free MRI.
Killing the one henchman
with a pacemaker
just outright.
Someone's having, like,
their lings pulled out
like it's fucking Magneto.
Magneto in the
metal-free prison
and Johnny English
comes by
in the fucking
magnet boots.
This is,
this is, like,
a half-funny joke,
right?
Because they're going up
the outside of it,
like,
we've got the element
of surprise on our eyes
and you see inside
that it's, like,
a kitchen and they're
watching, like,
a bunch of cutlery
just go,
up the wall.
Isn't that funny?
I don't know.
This is kind of funny.
They kind of do have
the element of surprise
for a second
and then
they're immediately
captured
by
Olga Kurilenko.
You may remember
from
women who were
in Bond movies
like five years ago.
Yes.
Yeah,
they do the same thing
that they did
with Rosamund Pike
and it's, like,
she was a Bond girl
and now you're
a Johnny English girl
and it's, like,
oh.
What a downgrade.
It's functionally
a demotion,
you know?
Yeah.
You're still,
you know,
within the kind of universe
we've been moved.
It's like we moved
Parish, you know?
Like,
she survives
the events
of Quantum of Solace,
right?
I believe so,
yeah.
In this case,
it would be very funny
if this was the same character.
Yeah,
I think so.
She's a Russian agent
in this as well,
so yeah,
maybe.
She's playing
Russian Girlovich.
Yeah.
Sister to Russian,
sister to Russian Guyovich
from movie number two.
No,
Russian Guyovich
has changed
her pronoun.
I can't keep up
with this woke shit.
Aw,
good for her.
Swear to God,
you can't say anything
these days.
Men turning into women,
it's just...
I know,
I know,
I know.
She locks them
in a cupboard.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I will also say this,
not the first time
I've said this
about someone
who's transitioned,
better straight woman
than I thought.
Like,
genuinely,
she out-acts
Ron Atkinson
in this.
Yeah,
she's good.
They escape.
English plants
the sherbet fountain
transmitter thing
on the server rack,
and then
as she's chasing them,
he goes,
oh,
I'll see you again,
dives backwards
over the edge
of the boat,
lands on a lower deck,
and she lands
a perfect,
like,
oh,
that's sooner than I thought.
It's a better joke.
She's got better
comic timing
than he does now,
which is grim,
you know?
Like,
all of your talents
just turn to ashes.
See,
that's horrible.
A grim portent
of things to come.
Come to kill James Bond
in, like,
2060
in the kind of,
like,
blasted remains
of England.
And you'll,
you know,
you'll be like,
oh,
I get that reference,
you know?
We're old as fuck.
We get this weird line next
because English and Bof
are having lunch
and they have this conversation
about what they've been doing
for the last eight years
and then Bof says,
oh,
were you teaching?
And he says,
if by teaching,
you mean scouting.
I'm like,
you're looking particularly
beautiful tonight.
You're looking particularly
beautiful tonight.
Yeah.
Like I say,
it makes the papers
like five years
after you leave the school
and you're like,
oh,
that guy.
Okay.
Yeah,
it makes sense.
And then they,
then this other exchange
happens where Bof says,
I got married.
And there's a pause
and I'm like,
are they going to do it?
Are they really going to do it?
Because like Johnny English
looks at him like,
Gay Bof?
Yeah.
And he goes,
yeah,
to a woman,
Lydia.
And I'm like,
oh,
beard Bof?
It's all,
I'm like,
oh,
come on.
It would have been funnier
if they were gay.
The whole,
the scene is truly
heartbreaking when you're
as deep into the Bof ex
Johnny English slash
fix scene as I am.
Literally one work
on AO3.
2,000 words roundabout.
It's actually,
it's all right.
Yeah.
Heteronormativity
comes even for the bot,
you know?
Yeah,
it's a shame.
It's a shame,
really.
All those nights
they spend together
lonely in the tents
on missions,
all gone now.
And he drops it
like a clang at,
well,
it's actually quite funny
that he's like,
yeah,
my wife is a nuclear
submarine captain,
meaning like she's at sea
like,
you know,
six months
every year.
And it's hard not to read
this as him,
but like,
yeah,
she's away.
Actually,
Johnny,
I never see her.
It's so lonely
being a bar.
And also,
Johnny English is like,
sexist again.
Yeah,
he is,
yeah.
Yeah.
He worked for a woman
that was his boss
in the last movie
and like,
also worked with a woman
who fell in love with him
and he wasn't that sexist
to either of them.
He wasn't like,
oh,
are you getting the coffee
or whatever?
Yeah.
Whereas this one,
he's like,
oh,
you know,
what does she do?
Like fucking,
I don't know,
like wear a lot of
Laura Ashley dresses
and has to be like that.
Yeah,
like he finds out
that she's like
in the Navy
and he's like,
oh,
is she like,
you know,
like a traveling secretary
or like a chef
or something?
Yeah,
not to defend
the institution
of the Royal Navy
here.
Far be it from me,
a person who once
stopped a whole podcast
to mention
that you don't lift
the port
to defend
the Royal Navy,
but.
Said I was sorry.
Just,
Jesus Christ,
man,
it's just like,
it's so laser targeted
at like boomers here
that it's just like,
when,
when did this,
when did Johnny English
become this?
It was already grim
to start with,
but now it's just like
Rowan Atkinson
looks down the camera
and says things
he thinks.
Yeah.
Or things that he thinks
you're like dad will like.
Fully.
Fully.
I'm actually genuinely
concerned where they're
going to go in Johnny English 4.
Ooh,
I have some thoughts
about this.
We'll get on,
well actually,
we're about to get to
the scene in this film.
Oh,
oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
so we are,
because they have to,
they have to have a chase
scene now,
right?
And Olga Kurilenko
is driving like an
electric BMW.
And this is the closest,
yeah,
it's the closest we get
to like self-deprecation
here,
because Boff has forgotten
to refuel the Aston Martin,
which English has said
is like surprisingly
economical to run.
Funny,
right?
You love a joke about
Aston Martin fuel economy,
don't you?
Yeah.
Oh,
I was hooting.
That's relatable.
Yeah.
Very relatable.
It's a lot like kind of
lobster,
de-boning.
In many ways,
it's the lobster of course.
You don't have to de-bone lobsters,
they don't have any bones.
They're on the outside.
Hey,
when I have to de-bone
my Aston Martin,
I,
this is,
this is a whole world
of experience,
which is foreign to me,
you know?
Like,
I just like,
regardless.
No,
I shouldn't tell that story,
that's cruel.
I was at a party
with someone.
Here we go.
Okay,
hang on.
They're a nice person
and I don't want to
identify them.
I was at a party
with someone once
who looked me
dead in the eye
and said,
because I went to Oxford,
I can make myself
like relatable
and charming to anyone.
And I went,
yeah,
bet.
100%.
I don't doubt it.
When do you start?
It paints them
in a really unfair light,
but like,
yeah.
Who knows who that could be?
Mentally,
there was a small lobe
of my brain
that was 3D printing
in that moment.
Regardless.
She's driving
the electric car
and Bof's like,
God,
that electric car
really seems like
it's the way
of the future,
doesn't it?
It's a lot like
the kind of cope
segments of
later Top Gear
where they would do
a thing about
the 900,000 pound
Lamborghini EV
and Jeremy Clarkson
would be like,
actually,
my career hasn't been worthless.
It's not all over
because you can still
drive the fast dickhead car
and not kill the seals
or whatever.
And it's still going to be
the fastest car
in the world.
And like,
it's just,
it was cope then,
it's cope here.
And so you just have
Ben Miller being like,
gosh,
that's awfully grippy
in the corners,
isn't it?
Maybe those electric cars
are onto something.
Meanwhile,
the Aston is still cool
but just like,
you know,
running out of petrol.
It's like,
the awareness of age
creeps in.
A bit of terror
management theory,
you know,
the one truly like
unconfrontable thing
in the human mind
is your own death.
And so you kind of like,
everything that you do
is kind of done
in order to distract
yourself from that,
whether that's like,
you know,
drive the V8 Vantage
or go to podcast live shows
or host podcast live shows.
Someone should make
a video essay about that.
It could be pretty okay,
I reckon.
Yeah,
so electric cars are the future
but they're slightly solar.
You know what's annoying?
Cyclists,
right?
And so,
they get blocked off
by a peloton
of French cyclists
cycling in France
in their own country,
minding their own business.
taking up a lane.
One armed.
Totally.
Well,
and what Johnny English does
is he fires a rocket
with a tear gas warhead
at the peloton of cyclists.
I'm not making this up,
I swear to God.
He tear gases
a bunch of cyclists
with a missile.
Now,
obviously,
we're thinking,
oh, okay,
well this is a comedy movie
and Johnny English
is supposed to be like,
wrong and bad.
So like,
they would,
obviously they're going
to do something with this.
They're going to like,
they'd punish him
by like having the tear gas
go off inside the car
or something like that.
But the thing is,
the movie genuinely believes
that cyclists are gay
and annoying.
Yeah.
So he just like,
authentically does it.
Well,
like,
well,
I don't know.
Like,
I found this scene
to be genuinely concerning
because they're aiming
for like,
Top Gear the movie.
Yeah.
But Range Rover mum
trying to run over
just-stop oil protests
was just four years
after this.
Like,
they've aimed for like,
Top Gear the movie.
What they've hit
is like,
incipient English fascism.
That's where Top Gear
was always going,
right?
Yeah.
That's the thing
is you escalate
on these things.
You start with
Johnny English 1
blowing up a speed camera.
You sort of midpoint
Johnny English 3
like,
tear gassing
some cyclists.
This is like,
the early years
of Mussolini shit.
Like,
I swear down,
like,
right now,
Johnny English 4,
they're filming him
running over
a just-stop oil protest.
Like,
it's,
motorist
as an inherently
reactionary caucus,
right?
And like,
an inherently English,
it's in his fucking name,
nationalist,
like,
thing.
A character who,
let me remind you,
like,
works for the British government,
here,
tear gassing cyclists.
It's like,
fuck.
Hasn't committed any crime,
legally speaking,
by doing this either.
Even if they're in
someone else's country?
Yeah,
no.
I mean,
in France,
sure,
but fuck them,
what are they going to do?
You know?
He's not called
Johnny France.
He's not called
Jacques Francais.
So,
you know,
get it up here.
I would actually like to see,
I hope Johnny English 4
is the Johnny English
OSS 117 crossover.
I do think that would be
quite funny.
True.
But a nice way
to heal the divide.
Hmm.
That's just sort of
bad cop,
bon cop.
But with spies.
Fuck,
I really want to see that now.
Can we,
can we like 3D print
that up in the back?
Like,
um,
so,
there's another cyber attack,
right?
Um,
and Liz Truss is
Liz Trussing about it.
I like her drink order here,
which is a vodka tonic,
no ice,
no tonic.
Well,
she,
she hears about this cyber attack
when she's complaining
about something else.
And what is she complaining about
to really ingratiate
this character
of the Prime Minister?
Oh,
strikes.
She's complaining about
the junior doctors striking.
Oh,
those greedy fuckers.
Oh,
those motherfuckers.
They're joining with,
like,
the train drivers
or something like that.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
How many junior doctors
and train drivers
do we have in tonight?
Anybody?
Yeah,
that explains the Aston Martin
I saw parked outside.
I thought it was a bit gauche
to have it painted primarily
in, like,
solid gold.
You know,
but,
yeah,
so,
to establish her as relatable,
she's being harassed by strikes,
which are really, like,
inconveniencing her.
Hugely.
Which I think is kind of the point
of one of those,
maybe.
Yeah,
that's sort of what they've got to disrupt.
The strike that really enhances
power's life,
you know?
Yeah,
yeah.
But anyway,
Jason Volta appears
in Downey Street.
He's like,
hello,
I will,
because the cyber attack's
going on right now,
and there's all the traffic lights
in London have turned red,
and he said,
I will fix these for you,
but I just need to reroute
all of London's traffic data
through my service.
We'll undo the plot
of the Italian job.
Yeah.
And so,
she's like,
yeah,
sure,
whatever you need,
and he,
like,
he,
like,
hacks British security
and does it,
like,
with his phone.
He's like,
yeah.
It's like,
you know,
it's very cool,
right?
Yeah.
And obviously evil,
but Liz Truss is not aware
of this,
you know,
because she's so harassed
by events because of,
you know,
strikes or whatever.
Like,
horny,
maybe?
She's like,
potentially horny as shit right now.
Yeah,
yeah.
She makes them all leave the room
so she can be alone
with this guy
at the end of the scene.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Not a fan of that.
I don't know where
the power dynamics are,
but they're fucked.
Like,
just don't do this.
We go to another luxury hotel next
because Johnny English
has arranged a date
with Olga Kalenka,
and they have this,
like,
really quite charming scene
at the bar together
where he's,
like,
failing,
to be bondish to her.
Yeah,
he fails every speech check.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
It's quite cute.
She orders,
like,
a Moscow mule,
and he's like,
I'll have a London lemming
with gin,
vodka,
armoniac,
sherry,
and parmesan.
Yeah,
and then you fill to the top
with,
like,
bovril.
Yeah,
yeah.
Except,
this is the thing about this,
because they don't ever really
sell the oath bits,
so,
like,
you get the set up
to that joke,
which is,
out of social pressure,
he has ordered,
like,
a horrible drink.
Yeah.
The punchline of that joke
is he drinks it,
and it's vile,
but he just drinks it,
and it's,
like,
it's,
like,
nothing.
There's no reaction.
Wait,
it made me wonder if it edited that out.
It gets interrupted by another weaker joke,
which,
it just kind of,
like,
trips over itself,
you know?
Um,
and he's,
he's,
like,
trying to charm her,
but is charmed by her,
because she looks like Olga Kurilenko,
right?
Um,
There is this,
like,
the funniest bit of the film for me
is when she then leaves,
and Boff comes down,
and,
and,
Boff,
by the way,
who has had to push the Aston Martin
the entire way to the hotel,
Boff is fucking ripped.
Yeah.
Boff's doing,
like,
ultra-marathon shit,
because that's not a light car,
first of all,
and he's had to push it,
like,
uphill in the south of France
in summer,
and then go and do some spying.
Like,
Jesus.
Subs really do work harder.
Like,
He's a power bottom,
all right?
We know this.
The fucking power.
But so,
he's just searched her room,
and,
and he's like,
what do you think of her?
And Johnny English is like,
oh,
she's amazing,
she's charming,
and she's completely innocent.
Like,
we shouldn't be spying on her.
It's like,
she's great.
And he's like,
I just found,
like,
five passports,
and,
like,
a gun,
a 3D printer,
like,
a list of targets.
Missing red flags,
like,
seems like a completely ordinary video essayist,
you know?
Totally normal,
you know?
And he,
like,
keeps making excuses for her,
which I do think is quite charming.
He's like,
oh,
somebody else,
it's fine to have,
like,
three passports these days.
Like,
well,
yeah,
of course she's got ammunition.
She's a single woman traveling alone,
and,
like,
I'm around.
I'm a fucking danger.
Like,
she needs that shit.
And we see that the FSB order her to kill him.
Yes,
immediately.
And she concludes that,
like,
because there's no information on him,
oh,
he's a,
like,
real professional,
which is kind of true in this.
Like,
he's just,
he's too good at this.
He was the king of England,
briefly.
Just,
again,
I just,
it's true.
Like,
they keep records of this.
You remember the most obvious joke in the movie?
That,
like,
these pills are the ones that,
like,
give you,
like,
24 hours of total energy.
These pills,
which are,
like,
visually indistinguishable,
like,
knock you out completely.
He was having trouble sleeping.
You,
you can write the rest of the scene yourselves.
They're,
like,
3D printed,
whatever.
He takes the high energy pills,
and he goes downstairs,
and just,
like,
hits the dance floor.
To be fair,
the,
the official stance of this movie is,
MDMA fucking rocks,
and you should do something.
Yeah,
Johnny English.
Johnny English gets off his fucking gourd on Uppercut.
He,
like,
he genuinely just,
like,
takes drugs and,
like,
dances for,
like,
10 full minutes of movie.
They're playing the weirdest movie,
the weirdest music in this club.
They're playing Sandstorm.
They're playing Darude Sandstorm.
Yeah.
I mean,
it's kind of,
like,
it's sort of,
European hotel disco.
I kind of believe they would play shit stuff.
Reasonable,
reasonable.
But,
so,
he's,
the other thing is,
this is the Rowan Atkinson physical comedy hour.
And so,
what they've done here is they've gone,
right,
Rowan,
we need you to act like you've just done MDMA.
It's just peaking,
and you're like,
you have infinite energy.
You are filled with boundless love.
You're experiencing empathy for the first time.
You're grinding your teeth really hard.
And he's too old to do it.
It's like,
well,
it's a lot like Biden,
to be honest,
where it's just like,
this would have sucked if you had been able to do it,
but it sucks in a different,
more pathetic way.
Now you're not.
like,
you've got to make way for like,
boff here,
who I guess is your Kamala Harris,
I guess.
because he's trying to do the like,
really high energy dance moves,
and it's just,
it just doesn't,
it's just an old man.
We can't let boff off the hook about Garza.
They really try to like,
pretend that it's like,
oh,
it's a new guy now,
you know.
I get a lot of messages.
The thing is,
right,
you can get really into the memes,
and like,
be like,
it's a hot boff summer,
but like,
ultimately,
ultimately,
it's not a hot boff summer,
if you consider the kind of,
geopolitics involved,
you know.
He's got sway.
Anyway.
It's not unreasonable.
Boff can cut off the supply of weapons
at any time.
Any fucking time.
And you know,
much like Kamala Harris,
boff has a questionable record
on trans rights.
You don't want to know
what boff did to those prisoners
in California.
But so,
we get a series of attempts
of Olga Kurilanko
trying to assassinate him,
and again,
she's a better straight woman.
She's better at this than him.
Yeah,
because she's getting like,
more and more frustrated.
She's trying to shoot him.
He's like,
jerking around,
dancing too hard.
She tries to dance with him,
and he fully like,
suplexes her.
Yeah.
He does suplex her.
Onto a hard dance floor,
and keeps dancing.
Which,
is some kind of a situation,
where you have to stop that person,
I think.
Like,
even at the most tolerant rave
in the world,
once you have like,
fractured somebody's cervical spine,
right,
you need to go to the chill out room,
like,
with an escort,
at that point,
you know?
This hotel does not have a mosh pit.
Okay.
And even if it did,
there's a limit,
you know?
Yeah.
You could jump a bit.
Very funny bit,
to be in like,
a five-star hotel,
and like,
the Cap D'Anti,
being like,
open up this fucking pit.
Open up this fucking pit.
Doing that shit in the Savoy.
Dear.
The Savoy so rarely opens up
this fucking pit,
as well.
Fortnum and Mason.
I'm just naming places,
I think would be funny,
to have a mosh pit.
Actually,
Fortnum's,
you could put a pretty good mosh pit,
in the downstairs bit of Fortnum's,
that would be quite funny.
Yeah,
do you remember when those,
like,
anti-austerity protesters,
opened up the pit,
in Fortnum and Mason,
and then all went to prison,
for like,
15 years off of it.
They got some great truffles,
out of it though.
Again,
the gulf,
the gulf.
Right.
If I'm on that street,
I'm going directly,
to Waterstones.
Like,
I'm moving past,
Fortnum and Mason.
Don't give a shit.
Moving different,
to a transphobic book chain.
Moving strangely.
Fortnum's is the second,
most embarrassing place,
I've ever been recognised.
I was in there,
buying some,
some sugared almonds,
for my auntie,
for her birthday,
because they're her favourite.
And I got recognised,
by a staff member.
And I was just like,
I just want to clarify,
I don't often come in here,
I'm here buying a present,
right?
But the most embarrassing place,
I've ever been recognised.
Just like,
is this your loyalty card?
Yeah.
I want to know.
The most embarrassing place,
I've ever been recognised,
was when I woke up,
after my orky.
Fuck you.
And I was talking,
to the nurse.
I didn't know they did that,
in Fortnum and Mason.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
You have to ask,
really nicely.
Yeah,
they hang them for 30 days,
for flavour.
No.
No,
I was talking,
to the nurse,
after my orky,
and I heard this,
this voice,
from like,
the bed,
curtained off area,
next to me.
So I'm just like,
is that Abigail Thornton?
And I was like,
I'm like,
oh shit.
And I had to,
I had to get up,
and be like,
fuck.
She's like,
hey,
how's it going?
And she like,
she just got her pussy.
She was like,
she was like,
I came out because of you,
I just got my pussy.
And I was like,
no one will ever believe you,
that I was here.
I mean,
this is,
I feel so much sympathy,
because as much as that's a weird story for you,
that's so much weirder for her.
She wasn't the one who had to go to work.
Yeah,
but you get out of,
like,
pussy surgery,
you're on the good drugs,
and then you hear the voice,
of your favourite YouTuber,
being like,
what's up chat,
and you're like,
am I hallucinating this?
Yeah,
she might,
she might just have found out,
if you're watching,
that was real.
I was there.
This is,
I guess,
this would be like,
if like,
the lockpicking lawyer,
happened to be there,
like my vasectomy,
or something.
I would hate to wake up,
from pussy surgery,
and hear a little click on one.
We'll,
we'll move on in a second.
Most embarrassing place.
No,
no,
no,
it's fine.
Getting the lockpicking lawyer,
in to get the chastity cage off you,
before pussy surgery.
I think he did do,
a chastity cage.
Binding on two,
look,
click on three.
I,
I got the gamut.
Worst place I ever got recognised,
was I was swimming,
and like,
the dude in the lane next to me,
knew who I was,
and it was like,
and I had not swum in a while.
I was not fast.
You were drowning.
Yeah,
I was like,
hey,
hey,
hey.
Best place ever got recognised,
first date with my,
with my beautiful partner,
Rebecca.
Someone was like,
oh my God,
are you Devin?
Like,
in the street.
And I was like,
fuck yes,
yes,
yes,
yes.
Thanks for letting me borrow,
the Lamborghini.
Slipped him a fucking tenner,
on the way back.
Thank you,
boss man.
That happened to me,
on my first date,
with my partner,
as we were walking along,
towards the cafe,
and someone ran down the street,
after us.
And I was like,
hell yeah.
Okay,
I'm getting in on this too.
Right,
worst place I've ever gotten recognised.
Might as well.
I was wondering about taking photos,
as is my want,
and when I'm doing that,
I'm so expecting,
someone to be like,
oh,
you can't take photos here.
Right.
I was taking photos,
and a couple stopped me,
leaving their apartment building,
were like,
hey,
you know,
November Kelly.
And I was so primed,
in that moment,
that I didn't even recognise,
my own name,
I'm just like,
what?
Sorry,
I'll move.
Already in the camera,
already in the fucking camera.
Fuck off.
I just got this,
is it brand new?
It's probably blurred,
I don't know.
And I scurried.
Is that November Kelly?
Boom.
Just like,
scooting out of it.
I'm moving in a way,
previously only described,
by like,
a biologist's field notes.
Right.
Oh,
I held it.
Beautiful.
You step in some wet cement,
and in like,
10,000 years,
they're like,
what the fuck were up
with these people's feet?
What was going on out there?
Raise some crab,
people.
The best place I ever got recognised,
was this year,
Glasgow Pride.
When the Scottish Green Party
asked them
if any of their sponsors
were complicit
in the genocide in Gaza,
they called the cops
on the Scottish Greens.
Cool.
So there was a,
like,
anti-these-guys protest,
like a radical block.
I recognised like,
three or four times there.
It was really chill,
it was really nice,
I met lovely people.
And like,
it just,
I had like,
a real sense of community,
and I was really glad for it,
you know?
It's really good to go to protest.
It is.
Yeah.
It's really good.
Get involved,
you know?
You can meet some
of your favourite podcasters.
Yeah, yeah.
Or,
Fortnum & Mason.
Yeah,
every year in the week
before my auntie's birthday,
that's when you'll find me there.
What happens in this fucking room?
I don't remember where we are.
We were in the luxury hotel,
he tried,
oh,
he got high as shit.
Oh,
they go back to,
London,
and he's still off his tits.
We got our second
buff ex machina,
where he's just like,
oh,
I figured out where the next location is,
let's go home.
It's back in London,
because Jason Volta owns the yacht,
and he's in Downing Street right now,
we have to go back there,
and they're driving back,
and he's still high.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah,
he's still,
like,
high energy,
so he's driving really fast.
And you get a joke
that says that that's cool.
Again,
I wasn't expecting this movie
to be like,
driving when you're on drugs?
Sick.
Like,
on uppers
actually makes you
a better driver.
That's it,
that's textual,
that's in the movie.
At this point,
they still have no evidence
that Jason Volta
is behind any of this.
No.
It's purely,
like,
hunch-based.
And so they say,
well,
okay,
what if we break into
his country home,
and Pegasus is like,
cool,
yeah,
show him out,
whatever.
Yeah,
cool,
just fuck around
and find out,
and my 7's all about that.
Yeah,
and so they get P back in,
and P is like,
I have got you,
and based on the dates,
this must have been,
like,
one of the first VR headsets,
right?
We've got you,
like,
a Gen 1 Oculus Rift,
and you're-
Did you forget,
Die Another Day did this,
did this gag,
with the virtual reality glasses.
Oh, God,
it did,
didn't.
Yeah,
you're right.
So,
basically,
he has to infiltrate
Jason Volta's,
politely,
grand designs ass house.
Yeah.
And they put him on,
like,
the floor that kind of,
like,
walks against you,
but he doesn't activate it,
because he's a boomer.
He's like,
I know what I'm doing,
it's fine.
Yeah,
because P's like,
oh,
let me go get the health and safety form,
or something,
and he's like,
yeah,
that's soy and gay,
all right,
bye.
And then he just,
like,
does it himself,
but,
like,
he doesn't activate the floor,
so he,
like,
goes out into the world,
like,
like,
he's walking around the mansion,
and he thinks he's in the mansion,
VR,
but he's,
like,
well,
we'll get to it,
we'll get to it,
let's run through this in order.
He,
what does he fucking do?
He attacks a guy in a baker shop,
with some,
uh,
baguettes.
Yeah,
with some baguettes.
He,
he,
he does,
while he's sneaking,
fully walk on all fours,
across the street,
which,
you know,
Pride Month seems to come earlier every year.
Um,
no,
no Johnny English at Pride.
He,
uh,
it makes the community look bad.
Boffs,
welcome.
Yeah,
that's true.
He pushes,
like,
not weirdly.
Yeah,
yeah.
Um,
he goes on a sightseeing bus,
and he attacks the tour guide.
That is the only funny part.
Well,
because,
because the actor who plays the tour guide is weirdly too into it,
and so it just kind of moans a bit,
when he's getting beaten up.
50-50.
I couldn't relate to this,
don't ask me how I got these.
It's like,
it's,
Johnny English comes up the stairs,
onto the top of the bus,
and the tour guide is,
like,
giving his tour,
and,
like,
you,
Johnny is walking towards him,
like,
karate stance.
And you see this guy,
like,
like,
looking,
like,
back side,
still giving the tour,
and just being like,
am I,
sir,
are you,
that's the funny bit.
That reaction shot is the funniest part of this movie.
Johnny English approaching you at walking pace.
Yeah,
exactly.
You will not do my ass, sir.
It's like the monster from It Follows,
but it's Rowan Atkinson.
Oh,
fuck that.
Terrifying.
But,
yeah,
it's just this kind of unsettling sequence of him lightly hitting a succession of men,
one of whom is going like,
ugh.
I'm sorry,
he does also,
like,
uncle chop an old lady in a wheelchair.
He does,
yeah,
he pushes her into traffic.
True.
She's fine.
Yeah.
Yeah,
she is then,
it should be fine.
Perfectly makes his way back to the starting point,
having,
like,
nominally completed the VR mission,
like,
Raiden.
Ha ha ha.
And,
yeah,
it's very funny,
I assume.
Then when he does it for real,
Yeah.
Ophelia Olga Kralenko just immediately spots him.
Oh,
and she looks so good in this scene.
Like,
she's got her hair back,
she's got,
like,
this black and orange dress.
She looks great in everything.
Yeah,
but,
like,
especially in this one,
I'm like,
she,
like,
grabs him and holds him at gunpoint,
and I'm just a little bit like,
hmm,
okay.
I mean,
my life's fine too,
I guess.
It's all right.
She puts,
she puts a gun to his head,
and she's like,
I work for the FSB.
And he's like,
oh,
great,
let's work together.
And I'm like,
uh,
it's 2018,
I don't think you should be doing that.
Yes.
Yeah,
that's going to be a sort of a friendship
that gets severed very quickly
in a couple of years,
you know.
Johnny English dying of radiation poisoning
after a polonium-laced cup of tea.
Yeah,
well,
I mean,
like,
spoiler alert,
but,
like,
they end up working together,
and then Olga helps him save the day,
but,
like,
the Litvin Yanko poisoning was 2006.
Like,
Johnny English,
I don't think you should be working
with Russian intelligence.
Pushing Johnny English out of a window,
like,
bundling him into a holdall.
I hate the physical comedy bits in this,
I say,
as Rowan Atkinson is folded into a tiny holdall.
It's kind of funny.
It's, like,
really funny,
and then suddenly stops being really funny.
Uh,
then it kind of starts again.
It's kind of funny for a little bit.
Yeah,
you know,
it goes around,
it comes back.
Um,
but they overhear that,
that Volta is behind the cyber attack on the London Eye.
Yeah,
which makes it spin really fast.
Funny.
Yeah,
ha,
ha.
Frankly,
if you pay to go on the London Eye,
you deserve it.
Yeah.
I mean,
that's,
that's a cyber attack that could affect upwards of tens of people.
Yeah.
Upwards of tens of the worst tourists you can imagine.
Yeah,
yeah.
I just can't imagine wanting to see more of London.
Like,
oh,
wow,
that's London.
Yeah,
cool,
cool.
You can see it from a slightly,
a slightly higher altitude and a slightly lower velocity.
Shit.
Dog shit.
Shit landmarker pricks.
Take it out of the skyline.
25 quid.
Take it off the board.
All the London branded shit that has the,
like the Ferris wheel in it.
Fuck off.
Yeah.
And apart from-
I guess we're calling it the London Eye,
but I think it's like Trip Advisor presents the London Eye
officially at the moment or whatever.
Yeah,
it's like fucking BA branded London Eye.
It's called some dumb shit.
Also-
Toshiba British intelligence bullshit.
When you consider that New Labour left London
with a big Ferris wheel and a tent,
you do have to imagine if there was some kind of
conscious clowning going on there.
Like,
Tony Blair,
the most secret alumnus of the École Golière,
like-
The government has been infiltrated by clowns.
Yeah,
the damn clowns in Parliament.
How would you tell?
The damn clowns.
All right.
Okay.
Big top.
Thank you.
Don't mind what I do.
So they overheat that Jason Volcher is doing this-
Why did my little, like,
end of laugh noise get some of you?
It's like,
that was funny.
All right,
continue with the bit noise.
Ah.
And then, like,
Olga has to take him,
like,
fake prisoner.
Yeah,
fake prisoner.
They did this bit in the last movie
with Daniel Kaluuya.
Yeah, yeah.
Until Daniel Kaluuya got killed,
I guess.
Yeah,
what happened to Tucker?
Dead.
Dead.
I hope he just resigned from MI7
and is just living his best life.
Like,
protest.
Yeah.
I hope he's having a good time.
Good for him.
Anyway,
he says,
I'm British intelligence,
and Jason Volcher says,
two words that have no business
being in the same sentence,
which I thought was quite funny.
Except,
we get some politics here,
because,
as Volcher watches
Both get chased across the lawn
by three XL bullies,
which,
Yes.
in many ways,
is deeply patriotic.
He goes,
What has happened to this country?
How is it possible
that less than a century ago,
the British Empire
ruled a quarter of the globe?
But now has,
you know,
is represented by these oaths,
right?
It's like,
well,
yeah,
Britain is ridiculous.
We have a big circus wheel
in the middle of the capital
for a start.
But,
like,
to be,
like,
ridiculous because we used
to have an empire,
the empire was also
fucking ridiculous,
for one thing.
But also,
we didn't become a joke
because of health and safety,
you know?
It's just this,
it's this clucks in our script.
I really despise it,
right?
And it's also not something
that, like,
Mark Zuckerberg would care about.
Like,
this is deep radicalization
Elon Musk shit,
right?
To be like,
Britain used to be cool,
but now it's Woke and Soy,
you know?
And he only got to that point
last week.
Yeah.
Jason Volter's daughter
follows me on threads,
and I feel kind of weird about it.
Yeah,
you should have her on the podcast.
Shout out Vivian,
if you want to.
Yeah.
I'll see you in LA.
But yeah,
I mean,
this is just the ideology
of the Craig Bonds,
like,
sort of,
with a gloss of comedy
over it too,
right?
It's like,
Britain is a nation
in decline.
Decline from what?
Don't worry about it.
Decline to what?
Don't worry about it.
Why?
Don't worry about it.
It's weird.
They believe that the empire
was an achievement of cleverness,
but no,
it was an achievement in cruelty.
Yeah,
like,
it was bad.
Could we just,
like,
put that down on the record,
by the way?
Like,
it wasn't good
that we had the empire?
Yeah.
We didn't get the empire
by being,
like,
super competent.
Like,
yeah,
okay,
we had some,
like,
resource management and shit
and,
like,
technologies that people
didn't have
because,
like,
we funded it through slavery,
but mainly what we excelled at
was dehumanizing
our fellow human beings.
It's good that we don't do that
as much anymore,
that we keep trying to bring it back
for some reason.
I remember a sort of
a comic attempt
to explain this.
It called Blackadder Goes Forth
with some guy,
in it.
That's not important.
But,
yeah,
so he,
he,
like,
English escapes.
He escapes.
He,
right,
they want us to accept
that Johnny English
can disarm and knock out
a heavy goon
with his hands cuffed
behind his back.
Yeah,
heavy goons.
I won't do it.
I won't do it.
He can't do that.
He's not a good spy.
Heavy goons can,
like,
you can't grapple them either
and you can't move them
onto a different tile,
so,
like,
he's,
he's basically fucked
by on paper,
you know,
he doesn't have the move set
for that shit.
Yeah,
this is a guy who should have,
like,
tripped through the kitchen
and been covered in olive oil
and then the goons can't catch him
because he's slippery.
Like,
that's how Johnny English escapes.
He doesn't escape
by actually bunching someone.
Yeah,
and he,
like,
knocks the olive oil over
accidentally as well.
Yeah.
It's, like,
just,
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna do something
very perilous here.
Everyone be normal,
right?
That's too fucking hot.
Right.
You're gonna be,
you're gonna be normal.
And you need to not
gesticulate very hard.
I,
yep,
hands by my side.
Wonderful.
So,
I hope we,
I hope we enjoyed the last,
sort of,
like,
hour and a half of motorist bits
because there's some more.
Here comes some more.
Here's some more motorist bits.
Here's a joke that was done
so much better in The Naked Gun,
but we're doing it here
for some fucking reason.
Yeah,
he interrupts a driving test.
Now,
are driving tests gay?
Yes.
Is that the bit?
Well,
learning to drive is for women.
If you can't drive,
yeah,
it's stupid.
If you're a man,
you should already know
how to drive.
Yeah.
Like,
what are you doing
learning how to drive,
you know?
Yeah,
exactly.
You should be able to drive.
Hanging out with another guy?
Ew.
In a car with,
like,
dual controls?
Just you and another guy
alone in the car?
You fucking,
anything could happen.
Like,
gear stick?
Gay?
Anything could happen.
Oh.
Anything could happen.
I,
I,
I gotta get some more
driving lessons,
I guess.
Um.
Charged me with
distracted driving.
No,
and I slapped my hand down
very hard.
Um,
so.
He uses the pedals,
he uses the driving
instructor pedals.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
to like,
speed away.
And then the,
the driving student
drives him all the way
to MI7,
I guess.
Yeah,
because she's got the wheel
but he's only got the pedals
so she,
she takes her glasses off
and it just tells her
when to turn the corners
and it's just not
really very good.
He does,
he does do the same joke
from the first one again
where he grabs
the wrong thing.
He grabs her phone
instead of his phone.
Absolutely formulaic shit.
Yeah,
so when he goes to
Downing Street
he's like,
I have the evidence
to prove that Jason Bolter
is fucking evil
and it's this like
cat video or whatever.
Yeah,
it's a recording
of a fucking birthday party.
But then,
we get the most interesting
bit of this movie,
right,
which is the politics
because Emma Thompson
is like,
first of all,
you're fired.
Right,
like,
she hits him with the like
obvious question
which is,
what the fuck is wrong
with you?
I do like that.
It's really funny,
finally in movie three
to have someone
turn around to Johnny Inch
and literally just go,
what the hell is wrong
with you?
What is medically
the problem
with Mr. Bell?
What the fuck is wrong?
But,
she gets this little speech
part of which goes,
Do you have any idea
how hard it is
to be me?
Do you have even
the foggiest notion
of how virtually impossible
it is
to get anything done
in the face of events
and facts
and voters
and that tsunami
of tosspots
we call the national press?
Because
she wanted to do something
good for her country.
Oh,
it's so hard
to be prime minister
of the United Kingdom
of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland.
I mean,
apparently.
It seems like it is
kind of tough.
Yeah,
I mean,
it's not easy.
That's the weird bit
because like she says,
I wanted to do something
good for the country
and that's why I've got
Jason Volter on board
to do all this shit.
It's like,
I don't believe
that Tory prime ministers
or indeed Labour prime ministers
sincerely want to do
good things for the country.
I believe they tell themselves that.
But I think it's like sustained
by its own fucking internal logic.
I think they do good things
for themselves in the party
and just brand it to themselves
as doing good things
for the country.
Yeah.
Yeah,
absolutely.
But this movie wants you
to be sympathetic to,
I guess,
Liz Truss by way of Theresa May
because it's,
it's,
it's tough.
It's tough out there
because of events.
Everyone's yelling at her
just because she crashed
the economy
and killed the queen.
Events and facts
and you fucking idiots,
the voters.
The bloody voters.
It's your fault,
you know,
like you're constantly
putting the government
under pressure
to do stuff.
This is 2018,
by the way,
and there's like a bit earlier
where she asks like,
has the leader of the opposition
come round from his surgery,
right?
And they go,
yes.
And she's like,
damn it,
can't I get anything?
It's like,
that,
that was fucking Jeremy Corbyn,
right?
I know that was Jeremy Corbyn.
And you cannot tell me
that this is a universe
in which the press
was more arranged
against Theresa May
right now.
I just wanted to do
something nice for my country
with a bunch of racist vats
and the voters.
I'm literally going to go
get another drink.
I can't fucking do it.
The press.
You can make me talk about this,
but you cannot make me
do it sober.
Yo,
if the thing's done 3D printing,
can you just like shoot me
in the back of the head
when you come back out?
Well, actually,
you got about 10 more minutes,
I think.
The specific line is,
has the leader of the opposition
come round from his heart surgery?
And mine would say,
that's Keir Starmer
having his removed.
So.
But anyway,
now we have to get
to the lower point of the film.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
First,
she does list English's misdeeds,
which,
and when she does this,
she pronounces
Peloton wokely?
A guided missile
at a peloton of French cyclists.
Peloton,
as well as baguette.
Organic sourdough baguette.
Organic sourdough baguette.
Does not list killing the queen.
No.
And then,
she fires him,
right,
and she goes,
I wanted to do something
nice to my country
and the universe sent me you.
And I just get a really nice,
like,
angry Emma Thompson drop
where she just says,
Up the universe is off!
The volume on that one.
It's nice.
But again,
my life could be a lot better.
And now again,
because it's formulaic,
we get the sad Johnny scene
where he's like,
Oh,
it's so bad.
He gets rained on again.
Yeah.
His shitty car won't start.
It's all condensed though
because last time
that scene was at least,
like,
you know,
three minutes long.
This time,
Boff just comes down
and goes,
Wait,
no,
don't.
Just skip the sad scene
because we've only got,
like,
95 minutes of runtime
in this film.
Yeah,
we're only going for
89 minutes.
this time.
So,
actually,
what if we just go,
my wife has a nuclear submarine.
Done.
Bish bash Boff.
She's good.
She's good, folks.
And at this point,
we meet November's
favorite character.
It's true.
The naval captain
of the submarine.
Boff's wife.
Ooh,
she's got
kind of a,
like,
Lady Sybil Vimes
thing going on.
If you know what I mean.
Does she?
Um,
Yeah,
no,
you're saying yes
because you're imagining
something else
than what's in the movie.
Like,
does she actually?
Yeah,
I think so.
Okay.
Kind of stern,
older,
you know.
I can see it.
I think,
I think.
Not to be messed with,
aristocratic.
I don't know.
To my mind,
Sybil is,
like,
big as well.
That's one of the main parts of it.
Not physically, necessarily.
Although,
by movie standards,
she's definitely,
like,
larger than,
like,
she's larger than fucking Olga Kurilenko.
It's like a size zero.
That's fair.
That's fair.
But what you'll remember
is that this is Boff's wife.
Now,
would you expect Boff
to talk to her
in any way?
Like,
be near her in the scene?
My wife and I...
Not when Johnny's around.
Johnny wouldn't give him permission.
Exactly!
Like,
this shit doesn't work
if he's married to a wife.
Like,
he's got to be fucking available
for Johnny.
It's true.
I speak to my wife occasionally.
You know?
I like to think so.
This is alright.
Love you, darling.
But so,
yeah,
no,
they don't speak at all.
Like,
fully.
Like,
she's just kind of there?
There's also a weird thematic bit
where, like,
the nuclear submarine
is old
and analog
and not gay.
Surprise is not old.
She has a bluff brow,
lovely lines.
No one would call her old.
She's in her prime.
It's the same bit.
Pass the fucking port.
So,
you can't use mobile phones
on the submarine
because they're gay and soy
and the submarine
will become confused.
It'll mess up the wiring
and the submarine.
So,
everybody, like,
note that down
otherwise you,
like me,
won't understand
the climax of the film.
Joining the submarine service
is the one place on earth
I can get away from Twitter.
So,
they drive the nuclear submarine
to outside the G-12 summit
in Scotland,
which I feel like
would raise some fucking eyebrows.
You can't just go
wherever you want
when you're the captain
of a nuclear submarine.
Like,
you've got patrol routes.
Now,
we saw a little film
called The Hunt.
And they are the following.
We saw a little film
called The Hunt for Red October
that begs to differ.
You've got some driving time,
you know,
to work in
before anyone notices.
I hate to deflate this,
but she says
that she's been tasked
to do security
for the G-12 summit.
What kind of security threat?
I don't know.
She's got a nuclear submarine.
Like,
what are you going to do?
Like,
if something happens
inside of the castle,
are you going to nuke it?
She's like,
all right,
level it,
fuck it.
I mean,
they get pretty close,
to be honest.
they do.
They really do.
So,
they have to infiltrate
this castle,
right?
Because this castle
is in Scotland.
And incidentally,
the way they shoot Scotland
in this feels
problematic,
xenophobic.
They shoot it
like fucking Mordor.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And Scotland
only looks like that
11 months out of the year.
So,
it's really unfair.
Johnny English is like,
it is a barren wasteland
filled with ash and dust.
The very air you breathe
is a poisonous fiend.
Yeah.
Outside the Tenants Brewery.
He has an exoskeleton
powered by a floppy disk.
Cool.
Update your technology charts.
Floppy disk's not gay.
Yeah.
No.
Floppy disk's straight.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Huge,
huge fans of floppy disks
out there.
Good evening.
So,
Jason Volta
is at this very moment
figuring out
that Olga is FSB
and is attempting
to poison him.
And he goes,
one second,
my 3D print's just finished.
And so,
he reveals
that he has been
doing
Mithridatism.
He has been taking,
like,
small doses
of the poison
she is about to poison him with.
Nice.
This is smart.
So,
so that he's immune to it.
Which,
okay,
sure.
And then she has a gun
and he's like,
I've been taking small doses of gun.
A small sip of gun
every day.
Only a perfect gun.
The Harry Dubois diet.
Mm.
No,
like,
he's taken the firing pin
out of her gun
and also,
he has,
in fact,
3D printed a plastic gun.
He has.
It's a Glock 9.
It's a porcelain gun
from Austria.
It doesn't show up
in your airport scans.
It's fully,
like,
transparent,
like,
wireframe.
Yeah.
Um,
I love Saints Row 3.
Um,
this fucking sucks,
dude.
So,
English,
English enters the room.
Yeah.
And,
um,
his line is,
save the pillow talk
for your prison cell.
Okay.
Don't like that.
Not,
not a fan of this.
Um,
and,
yeah.
Okay,
right,
the exoskeleton is,
like,
really strong.
Okay,
it's very strong.
And he accidentally gets,
like,
a fucking suspender
caught on the window frame
or something,
right?
And he's walking forward
and it's stretching
the suspender out.
Snack hazards.
Cool.
Yeah,
yeah.
It's like a thing
you can have
in Australia.
That's not a hazard,
baby.
He gets wily coyotes
out of the window.
Yes.
Into a freezing cold
Scottish lot.
Yeah.
Where he presumably
should have drowned,
but sadly,
the movie continues.
Yes.
And they go,
okay,
well,
we've got to do
this scene again.
You've got to infiltrate
the thing again.
That last scene,
that was a practice
infiltration.
You could have just not
had it in the movie.
Yeah.
Just research your last
checkpoint.
So then,
this being Scotland,
they go in disguised
as pipers.
And the G12 summit
is happening
and we get a shot
of, like,
the G12 world leaders,
but they're not,
like,
the real ones.
They're not the real ones.
It's not really Theresa May.
Okay.
No,
as in,
like,
it's not really Theresa May,
but it's like a prime minister
in the Theresa May vein,
right?
And what I've noted
is, like,
the guy they get to play
Schmonell Trump
is way better looking
than, like,
real Trump.
He looks,
he looks,
like,
insanely hot,
like,
the guy they get to play
Trump in this.
He's, like,
a really wide,
tan guy with,
like,
a blonde quiff
and a red tie.
They get hot Trump.
Hot Trump.
They get the top Trump.
My God.
Come on.
I, um,
didn't need to put
those words together.
Also,
there is a point of divergence here
because the G12
of the Johnny English universe
includes Pakistan
and South Africa.
So, you know,
reconfigure your CIA
world fact books,
you know.
But so,
they infiltrate as Pipers
and English gets chased
and he has to hide
in a suit of armor.
It's kind of like
a semi-funny joke
that he's playing
the bagpipes badly
but no one can tell
because, like,
they sound weird
or whatever.
It comes across
as very, like,
chauvinist.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Because it is.
I mean, yeah.
It's unkind
to do this to Scotland,
I feel.
It's not high up
the list of cultural
insensitivity
but it's on there,
you know.
It counts.
It counts.
It counts.
So, meanwhile,
Volta is getting
the, like,
Prime Minister
to sign over
all of the government's
data to him
so that he can,
he has this little speech,
right,
about the problems
that there are
which,
of which he has
long lines in airports.
That's the first one
he says,
in 2018,
what's the number one
problem in Britain?
Fucking Q at Heathrow,
I know.
Q at Heathrow, yeah.
Well, Brexit,
it just happened
so I guess that was
like a topical thing.
Sure.
But he says,
like, failing schools,
crumbling hospitals
and long lines
and airports
can fix all of those
if you just give me
all of your data.
Sure.
And she does
and he immediately goes,
yeah, fucking got you,
all the rest of you.
Also, because,
and this is the,
like,
this is the biggest
cinema sin
in the movie,
right?
It's the thing
that I think
made me angriest
as well
is,
so,
he threatens her,
right?
And the way
that he threatens her
is he tells her
what he's gonna do.
Like so.
If I turn the internet off,
cities will go dark.
Planes will fall
out of the sky.
Trains will collide.
Law and order
will break down
and the world
as you know it
will be over.
Show.
Don't tell,
right?
You may have heard
of show,
don't tell.
It's a little,
like,
screenwriting maxim,
right?
Something that,
like,
in a well-written thing,
your characters
shouldn't use
unnecessary exposition
like I'm doing now.
Exposition means
explaining something
that the audience
doesn't know.
Instead,
you just,
you show them
doing the thing
and you trust
that the audience
is smart enough
to piece it together,
right?
Yeah,
but they're watching
Johnny English 3,
so,
like,
let's give them a,
come on,
come on.
If you're in
Johnny English 2,
right,
where the racist bit
happens,
and they write
themselves into-
Maybe more specific.
The bit where Johnny English
calls Daniel Kaluuya's
character,
boy.
Right,
yep.
And then in the next line
goes,
I meant that in a not racist way,
right?
That was a situation
of writing yourself
into a corner,
not realizing you have
a backspace button
and trying to write
your way out.
This one is like,
I'm going to write my way
into this corner of telling
and not showing,
and then I'm going to include
the advice
to show,
not tell,
rather than,
like,
I've remembered this,
but I have no
backspace function.
I can't rewrite the scene
to just show.
I have to have the tell
and then show,
don't tell.
I hate it so much.
It insults my intelligence
and yours.
It's just,
it's so unprofessional.
And it really fucking
bothers me.
Do you think they just
had, like,
a writer go through
and check things
and that was just
a note he left,
but they accidentally
thought it was like...
He, like,
just read that out loud.
Yeah, yeah.
He just read it out.
Anything you put on screen,
Burgundy will read.
So he turns off
all the power
and internet
to Europe.
Yes.
Everyone is greatly relieved,
I'm sure.
Thank God for that.
And he's like,
unless all the countries
of the world
sign over all your data,
I will turn off
all the power
and internet everywhere.
I've got to be honest,
I don't think Trump
would do this.
I don't think he would either.
I don't think he takes that deal.
I think he's too dumb.
Like,
I think he would just fully,
like,
be the hold out there,
you know?
But so,
it doesn't matter
because he's working
his way through them.
And,
uh,
English,
wearing the suit of armor.
John English has a suit of armor
but he's gotten caught in it
because he fell over
doing one of the only
funny jokes they've got
which is when he falls over.
Hmm.
Um.
Now I go,
uh-huh.
That's good.
Um,
but he's, like,
gotten stuck in it now,
like,
the buckle isn't loosening
and he is, like,
he hits it with a bit of oil.
He hits it with a lot of oil,
actually.
Yeah, he loops the fuck out of it.
He,
he really lubricates that thing.
They get a real close-up
on his face
and he's, like,
running his tongue
across his teeth
as he does it as well.
It's, like,
very bizarre.
You know how they say, like,
use more than you think
you're gonna need?
Yeah.
This is probably too much.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Um,
it still won't open.
And so,
he enters the situation,
right?
He enters the room
where this blackmail is happening.
He's, like,
uh,
you know,
a vastee,
or whatever the fuck you say
when you're wearing a suit of armor.
Johnny English,
I'm here to do the denouement
of Johnny English 3.
Never a fan of the Lego Castle theme,
so I don't know what knights say.
Um,
have at you,
I suppose.
Um,
trips,
falls,
slides perfectly out of the room.
Thanks.
Yeah,
he slides because of the oil.
There's a lot of oil.
Because the oil.
It's dropping.
Because the lube oil.
Out of the sea.
Yeah.
Um,
he then makes a phone call
because he's standing near the submarine.
The,
the phone call
accidentally submarines,
the submarine,
missile,
submarine.
Well,
he's on,
he calls up,
he calls up the secret services,
which as we know,
are run by Toshiba.
So,
immediately they're like,
oh,
for MI6.
Oh,
they forgot that joke.
It's not anymore.
Like,
they just,
whatever.
This is just like,
yeah,
they're like,
oh,
for MI6,
press one,
from MI7,
press three,
or whatever,
and he presses three,
and like,
in the nuclear submarine,
you see like,
the launch code open up,
and it's,
the first one is three.
And you go like,
oh,
it's not how any of that works.
It's not how that works.
It's not how that works.
He just,
he puts in the,
the launch code,
by like,
answering the questions on like,
the,
the thingy.
Causing the,
the submarine to launch a nuclear missile.
Well,
well,
to be fair,
they do have to double check,
but.
It's,
yeah,
they have to check,
and because they put the phones next to each other,
when English says he needs to order an attack,
they,
they hear attack,
and they order the thing,
right?
They fire the missile.
It's,
it's textually,
I,
I don't imagine it's a nuclear missile,
it's just a ballistic missile,
right?
But like,
fine.
It would be much funnier if we could just assume it was a nuclear missile.
It's a nuclear missile.
Scotland.
Yeah,
yeah,
for sure.
They're gone.
I,
I,
I,
I have,
I have,
I have to do these things,
I have to say these things,
and I'm so sorry.
I,
it's,
it's the port thing again,
right?
Because when,
I,
I,
I really appreciate,
you guys supporting me,
you know,
it means a lot because,
I didn't say I was supporting you.
Fuck off back to Fortnum and Mason then.
I,
I,
I,
I,
I,
I,
I,
I,
I,
it's just,
I think I'm starboarding you actually.
Thank you.
It's,
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's compulsive,
right?
You know,
if you don't lift the port,
when she,
when she gets the,
the fire order,
she says,
General quarters,
we are,
go for launch.
And general quarters is an Americanism,
you say action stations,
I'm sorry I'm like this,
but if it takes you two seconds,
about England,
to find,
if you,
if you know how to use the computer,
and do research for the screenwriting that you're doing,
right then,
it's,
it's very,
uh,
Also,
action stations is a cooler line.
Yes.
Yeah.
It literally is.
I,
it doesn't,
it doesn't matter,
right?
It's purely like a cinema sins thing.
It's such a reductive thing to care about.
But for some reason I do,
and it's the thing that lodges in my brain about this movie.
Nothing else will.
I,
I don't know why I'm like this.
Thank you for listening to my comedy podcast.
Thank you.
We need to have outlets for these things,
you know?
So,
because he's planted the sherbet fountain on the server rack,
it's like designated as like an enemy target.
So a missile goes,
and then it comes down and fucking obliterates her.com.
And I was like,
Oh,
that's where all the data was being dated.
Oh shit.
That's where they were rerouting the fucking data.
Any of the data anymore.
Fuck.
The plan is foiled.
The dot,
the dot com goes out like James Bond.
Yeah.
Getting,
getting killed by the Royal Navy.
Like,
um,
that shit was just about to get married too.
Found,
found out I had a kid.
I mean,
it's rough.
Um,
but so,
Bolt is like,
oh fuck,
I'm owned.
Immediately tries to flee the scene.
Which he doesn't,
doesn't need to do.
He has,
like 12 world leaders held hostage.
Yeah,
that's a position of strength.
Oh,
I can't do the data thing anymore.
I better go.
Me,
me when I like lose one hand of blackjack,
and I'm sitting on this huge pile of chips,
I just toss them all,
run,
you know?
Um,
he also has a gun.
Yeah.
I feel like that gives you some leverage.
Yeah,
quite a bit,
I would say.
Yeah,
you've taken,
I hope so.
I'm counting on it.
If the 3D print ever,
like,
put it on the table in the middle of a meeting.
Yeah.
Just let them know you have a gun.
Just,
yeah.
Changes the tenor of the conversation ever so slightly.
What if they then go,
thank you very much?
Well,
that changes the tenor of the meeting once again.
Unfortunately,
I've got my second gun.
Yeah.
And now the conversation's back on level 40.
Always bring one more gun than you think you need,
just in case.
It's a lot like lube in that way.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
I prefer a silicone-based gun.
Um.
Are you wearing protection?
Very,
very slippery gun.
Um.
Very buttery gun.
Sorry,
babe,
the,
the Kevlar vest stays on during sex.
I mean,
can it though?
Uh,
so Johnny English goes after him in a suit of armor.
Yeah,
the joke is that he has to move really slow because of the armor.
That shit's light.
Yeah,
that's your cinema sins ding there.
Ding.
You can,
you can do all sorts of shit.
You can see guys doing like doing the Macarena on YouTube.
You can do star jumps in a fucking suit of armor.
Like you have to be able to.
It's like,
it wouldn't work if you couldn't move in it.
Like if in the middle ages,
it's just a bunch of guys just like going to quack.
Against each other the whole fucking time.
Be a little funny.
It would be a little funnier.
Anyway,
Olga hands Johnny English an iPad and says,
Oh,
use this to hack Volta's computer.
They start helicopter.
And Volta's like,
Oh,
look,
you can't work an iPad.
Number of hours in and you're still getting tutorials.
It's like it was made by fucking rock stuff.
Um,
but it's like,
Oh,
you can't use an iPad granddad.
And then he just like throws it at him and knocks him out.
And I'm like,
Oh God,
my notes here say,
God,
the insecurity,
because Johnny English smashes Volta's phone with a sword.
And it's like low tech versus high tech.
But when he does,
he like sort of ambles up to the phone,
the phone,
which has like a Siri on it,
like a kind of AI voice activated thing.
Yeah.
It's going like all the data has been like reconfaculated to the Nevada.
Yeah.
We haven't mentioned this because it's not funny at any point,
but like the whole way through,
he's going like,
what's my plan against Siri.
And it just tells you what his like super objective is.
It'd be funny if he had like programmed it to be like too into him or whatever.
But anyway,
it's lying on the floor and it's like,
do you want me to activate the cyber attack?
And before he stabs the phone with his sword,
damn black mirror,
he says the phrase,
activate this,
which seems like the thing that you shouldn't say.
Yeah.
In response to the question,
do you want me to activate the cyber attack?
And that's a better joke than they put in the movie.
Yeah.
No.
Did Johnny English stab phone with sword?
He do.
He do stab phone with sword.
Gay phone defeated.
Phone bad.
It's super sick,
but his like epic,
like line is to a phone.
Not to like the villain or anything.
He's just like,
it looks like I took you offline.
And he's talking about like a shard of glass on the floor.
Yeah.
The villain has just been hit in the back of the head with a piece of like,
you know,
that was pretty funny though.
That guy is like good physical acting.
Got perfectly Cheryl Cole.
It was really good.
So.
The prime minister then says in front of world leaders like,
oh,
the day has been saved.
Thanks to Johnny English.
Who is a living embodiment of fundamental British values.
That's right.
That's a phrase.
This is not one of the British values.
Well,
here we get a rundown of what those are.
Right.
So the fundamental British values are courage under fire.
Ingenuity.
Well,
now hold on.
I thought this isn't.
And quiet dignity.
And I think that if those are the three fundamental British values,
then every single fucking trans person in these islands deserve the goddamn knighthood.
That's right.
You're so right.
And the thing is,
the quiet dignity thing is the only one of those that's really a laugh line,
right?
Because his armor fall down and expose his penis.
Mm-hmm.
Everybody gets to see like Johnny,
his dick and balls.
Which have been jelked really long.
Thanks to the,
thanks to the events of Johnny English 2,
which we all remember.
You just see a bunch of paparazzi,
take photos and then pan down.
Changing lens with a wider lens on.
Crash zoom out.
Just like swap into a shorter lens.
Just like,
oh, hang on.
The fuck?
What the fuck is going on?
Badly jelked former king.
Once again,
saves country.
Yeah,
the continuity is real weird with Johnny English.
Well,
he's the same guy in all three movies.
He was.
Okay.
So,
and the day is saved thanks to Chexnot's Russian intelligence.
Yeah.
You got it.
Don't worry about it.
You got to hand it to him.
And Britain is a fundamentally decent and patriotic nation that is also a bit silly,
which is not really a crime.
Nothing bad.
We've never done anything bad.
We've just been a bit of a joke,
which lets us off the hook a bit,
I think.
You know?
It's nice.
Doesn't get a knighthood back.
No,
he does go back to being,
he goes back to his old school.
And all,
young people respect you now,
because you smash bone with sword.
It's true.
And the young people,
you know,
they're letting all,
they're forgetting all about the gender shit now,
because they're not woke and gay and soy.
They're not woke anymore.
They're digging man traps in the woods.
That is a first class man trap.
So,
we end the movie.
And everyone claps.
Well,
we have to end the movie,
not with that bit of wish fulfillment,
but with another bit of kind of like cringe,
no,
don't humor,
which is,
the final shot is the headmaster of the school,
about to take a bite out of one of the jelly babies,
which suggests,
Immediately.
that a few seconds after this film ends,
what is happening is those children,
are seeing a man get the top of his head blown off,
changing the nature of their bond forever.
forever.
That shit's like the boys.
Yeah.
It's like,
I mean,
granted,
this would be like the fifth most traumatic thing to have happened at my school,
but like,
they'll take that shit in stride.
Even so,
that's a lot to be showered with the like brain matter of your headmaster,
you know?
No,
they're all heart and killers at this point.
Johnny's trained them well.
They're fucking vicious.
One of them tries to garrote one of the other kids,
actually.
Hmm.
Sorry.
But that's the movie.
That's how it ends.
It's the fucking movie.
That's it.
We're done.
No credit scene.
They're out.
They literally are just like,
check please.
I'm out of here.
Fuck this.
Yep.
Well,
until next time,
until Johnny English falls.
Johnny English.
He imagined a new car he wants,
so he's back.
And of course,
as we theorize,
Bond is weak now.
There's no Bond.
Something has to fill that gap.
It's like Colin Godzilla.
Exactly.
Johnny English is resting at the bottom of the ocean after this for a couple of like centuries.
I really thought the English minus one was like,
kind of.
It was,
it was overhyped,
I thought.
It was revision,
it was like revisionist,
you know,
and like pretty right wing as well.
Much like this movie.
Shin Johnny English,
however,
now that was a pretty fucking good one.
When they did the American Johnny English with Matthew Broderick.
Oh my God.
See,
the end of English minus one,
you see the Englishness spreading up her veins.
I hate when this happens to me.
So,
what did we make of this movie?
And I guess all three movies,
because we can kind of wrap it up into,
you know,
with a bow here.
Like,
what did we make of the experience of watching all three extant Johnny English films?
I didn't have a good time.
No?
No,
me either.
That's like three days I've woken up and watched a Johnny English movie first thing in the morning.
And like,
that has not made me mentally healthy.
That's a difficult morning watch,
you know?
I think it's,
it's made me quite upset.
Because the,
the actual Bond films,
they only say things about England like obliquely,
right?
Yes,
he's British.
And yes,
we get some luxury British brands that your dad can buy.
But for the most part,
they stay away from trying to actually say something about the values of the nation explicitly.
Yeah.
Well,
in the first one.
This tries to,
and like the shit they come up with is just depressing.
Yeah.
Like,
in the first one,
he's like willing to be like,
this is the country I love.
But like,
that kind of line just doesn't come back in either of the next two.
Like,
yeah.
And like,
to see the conservative prime minister talking about fundamental British values,
and like,
all I,
all I see in,
in my head is fucking protesters getting their head kicked in.
I'm just like,
I don't know.
I'm just feeling excluded from nationalism now at this stage.
Like,
lame.
I'm sorry.
That's not a very funny thing to say on the comedy podcast.
I mean,
don't worry.
Was,
was,
we know what it says about Englishness then.
What does it say about masculinity?
It's cool.
It mostly says shit about boomer masculinity,
right?
It primarily goes like,
everything is soy and gay now,
and you're right for thinking that.
And therefore,
you should attack cyclists with your car.
Yeah.
No repercussions for that at all.
Wish fulfillment,
right?
Like,
I,
I do all this cool boomer shit that no one knows how to do anymore.
I'm,
you know,
I'm the only one who can still do it,
and they still need me.
People still need me.
I'm still relevant,
you know?
Young people will respect me.
I smash a phone with a sword.
This is a rough,
sort of really,
like,
lack of introspection movie to make in the twilight of your career,
you know?
Yeah.
Like,
having made all the Mr. Bean shit that everybody in the world loves,
and is going to give you infinite money for,
to be like,
I've still got it.
I've still got it.
This is a movie about how,
how about how I,
Rowan Atkinson,
have still fucking got it,
is pathetic.
It's really insecure.
Yeah.
It's,
it's,
um,
the,
the Chaplin disease thing again,
right?
Like Woody Allen,
you know?
It's like,
it's therapeutic.
It fucking sucks.
Don't watch these.
It's sad to watch.
I'm like,
you could have just lived off fucking royalties from reruns of Blackout for the rest of your life.
Yeah.
Like,
you can be remembered fondly,
you know,
if you try and keep up with anything current,
instead of being like,
actually,
I'm just going to insult the way things are now,
because they inconvenience me as sort of like multi-millionaire personally.
They seem,
these films seem better,
increasingly so as the trilogy goes on.
Getting worse.
Like,
you can really track the,
the health of the English and the health of the Johnny English are one.
Like,
it's,
um,
the English have 60 million and one bodies.
And it really,
like,
you can track the kind of descent into madness,
you know?
Like,
what's the,
what's the onset time of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease again?
Like,
at least three movies.
But,
we don't have to speculate about these things,
because we have a 3D printed gu-
because,
because we have a science-based system.
You know,
you know,
as a trans woman,
I can come out onto any stage in this country and get that reaction.
So much better from you guys.
I just said the phrase funny every time,
by the way.
Just,
I just heard someone say that.
I know we do it a lot.
It's,
it's called the scum system.
It stands for smart,
cultural insensitivity,
unprovoked violence,
and misogyny.
How smarmy,
we're going to break the fucking wheel.
How smarmy,
is Johnny English strikes again?
I hate this fucking movie so much.
Just earnestly.
It's the most smarmy,
hands down,
hands fucking down.
I know we gave the first one seven,
which means we got to get into the fucking punitative zone.
I think the second one's seven too.
I mean,
I think this might be the smarmiest film I've ever watched.
It's absolutely the smarmiest.
Yeah,
it's very bad.
Like,
nine?
I'll do nine.
Yeah,
no hesitation.
Just let it bark.
Nine.
Cultural insensitivity.
Um,
I mean,
well,
they've once again gone back to forgetting that people of color exist.
Yeah.
They're allowed to work in Downing Street.
Not at the top.
That's true.
But they're there.
The,
the has two lines never named kind of Moneypenny character as a black woman.
Yeah.
She gets to say Bristol Temple Meads in a funny voice.
Mm-hmm.
Which to be fair,
she sells the fuck out of.
But like,
if you've got two lines in the movie,
you fucking hit those lines.
All right.
Yeah,
yeah,
no question.
Um,
yeah,
it's fine.
I don't know.
It's,
it's back to,
it's back to a mission and to like,
go back,
really marries up with the smarmiest.
I think that makes it more racist.
Also,
Scotland does have sunlight now because of climate change.
Yeah.
It's like making fun of the Scots is something that like early bombs did.
It's like Scotland as Mordor.
Yeah.
The same thing as like,
oh,
the French or,
oh,
the Swiss,
you know,
it's just like,
it's like sort of very visibly going down a list of like,
what can I do that won't be racist,
but will like appeal to women?
Four?
Probably four.
I'd comfortably do four.
What kind of whites are we allowed to hate?
Let's go on down the list now.
Looking at the R.
Scots white dial and be like,
ah,
it hasn't moved in a few hundred years,
but I reckon we could probably,
you know,
Hamza Yousaf,
single-handedly responsible for shoving that down.
Um,
unprovoked violence.
I feel like this one's going to be quite high.
He does attack some cyclists.
Civilians,
mind you.
Yeah.
I want to fucking punish him for the cyclists because the movie doesn't.
And it's like stupid and bad.
He gets lightly disciplined for it.
You know,
like you get yelled at one time by Emma Watson.
My life could be so much better.
Part of a series of things she's upset about.
And one of those is like annoying me.
And then like down the list is you shot a missile at a bunch of French cyclists.
Yeah.
It's like you can be inside the room when there's a chief constable getting yelled at,
you know?
Yeah.
Um,
yeah,
no,
I just,
it's,
it's higher than,
he doesn't kill anybody.
Like,
I don't think he does.
Does he?
Unless you can,
is an iPad in the back of the neck fatal?
He what?
He does burn a restaurant down.
That is by accident.
Nah,
yeah,
he does that by accident.
Whomster among us has not accidentally burned a restaurant down?
Come on.
Yeah,
the Fortnum and Mason's food court never was the same.
I'm not allowed back.
Uh.
Order those almonds online.
Um,
four,
five?
I'll do four,
I think.
I,
I want to give it a five.
He did it.
He attacks it.
There were a lot of cyclists.
Five.
You know what?
Five.
Five.
Fuck them.
Peloton of French cyclists.
This is scientific.
Yeah.
Misogyny.
Um,
I mean,
Olga Kurilanko gets to be good at being a spy,
but in the kind of like,
and she's hot and she kicks ass kind of way.
She doesn't fall in love with Johnny English.
True.
He doesn't get the girl.
Thank God.
No, he doesn't.
Yeah.
He gets the more important thing for an old man,
which is respect from the youth.
Children.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The real romance arc is him and a class full of children.
Well,
they did call him Johnny English.
Like,
I,
which one's the fucking rabbit in drop?
The what?
The fucking rabbit,
right.
You're looking particularly.
Oh,
it's,
oh,
fuck.
Beautiful tonight.
You're looking particularly beautiful tonight.
You're looking particularly beautiful.
Nice.
They're all raising little martini glasses at him.
It is.
For real though.
Also,
sorry,
one second.
Yeah,
just a.
Ah,
the heckler.
It's becoming very like,
Geralt to me.
It's like,
ugh,
heckler.
I guess like,
well,
it does show us that women can command nuclear submarines and nations.
True.
I know it doesn't do what they did to M in the second one,
where it's just like,
she's a woman,
she has children.
True.
It seems like we've accepted that women can be in charge of things now,
and they're not a principal cause of things being soy,
woke,
and gay.
It's,
it's true.
I,
in that case,
I don't know.
It's improved slightly.
Like a two or three?
Three.
I can do three.
I want to give three.
I listen to women.
In that case,
that gives us a total score of 21,
which puts it pretty much in the middle of the other two.
First night was 20,
this is 24,
and right now I'm 21.
So.
That tracks.
That tracks.
Second one's the worst one.
We've got zero racist noise drops for this one,
and we had fucking-
Yeah,
literally.
That's a good point.
We had two for the second and three for the first,
so like-
Yeah.
I lunged in for the racist noises,
and now I realized I don't want to do that.
Yeah.
You know the noises.
Oh,
you really do have like-
Yeah,
do you want to hit one?
Be my guest.
I'm good,
actually.
I think I'm fine.
Any of these.
This one right here is particularly like rancid.
That's very rancid.
I'm not going to click that one.
I might just do this instead.
Careful, Whitey!
How does this compare to Bond?
To James Bond?
Will Jomney English do what James Bond didn't?
It's-
Oh,
I really hate myself for Jomney English.
It's like a bad-
Everyone's an Englishman,
and you're an Englishman too.
It's the same as No Time to Die,
which I think kind of tracks.
It is kind of the same film as No Time to Die as well.
License to Kill,
it's about as-
It's like a bad Brosnan.
It's like Die Another Day level Brosnan.
Yeah,
that figures.
That tracks.
Yeah.
So,
yeah,
really just confirming our theory that this is just more Bond.
It's like the Bond comedy annex,
you know?
It's like the Bond-
It's like James Bond show at the Fringe,
you know?
Yeah.
James Bond many times cancelled one-man show at the Fringe called,
like,
Sorry to Offend You or whatever.
But so,
we also do have some awards to give out, possibly.
Yeah,
I've been thinking about that.
I'm trying to figure out if there was any goon.
We give out a Kronstein Rosette for Henchmen Who Goes Above and Beyond,
and we give a Goodnight Cross for, like-
There aren't even that many henchmen in this.
There's no notable goons.
There's hardly any gooning of any kind.
It's a damn well goon-less movie.
None of the goons have any kind of source whatsoever.
True.
Like, they've not got any named, like, Mr.
Right?
Like, it's just sort of guys.
Needed a henchman, you know?
Really needed a Mr. Something.
Mr. Surname.
And none of the allies go above and beyond either,
because every single person is phoning it in in this movie.
Yeah.
It's never existed.
You know, the Mr. Surname is up in heaven being like,
I wish you hadn't written me out of the script.
You know?
So, in that case-
No awards.
Nothing.
No awards.
Nothing.
The honor system is corrupt anyway.
The thousands of, like, aborted Mr. Surnames in heaven are looking down.
I could have been in your movie.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't say duh.
Okay, boss.
Aborted henchman.
Aborted henchman, GF.
I'll never tell you always.
I'll never check the perimeter.
I could be checking your perimeter right now, Anon.
You know?
It's a real, like, 94th minute.
We're done.
We're done.
Is there anything else?
Any other business?
No, no.
Well, there is some other business, right?
Which is that the bar is open for another half hour.
That's a good business.
We will be outside.
We will have merch to sell.
You can buy this poster.
Again, risky point.
You can buy this poster.
You can buy little pins of the Kronstein Rosette and the Good Night Cross.
We will be selling them.
We will be autographing stuff.
We will, like, hang out.
We will sign pretty much whatever.
We signed someone's medication the other day, someone's disability card.
Did you hear that?
Did anyone else hear how I should say, we will suck?
Just then?
Okay.
I made eye contact with a couple of people in the audience that had, like, a raised eyebrow.
Trying to do a whole thing with it.
It takes a while to bet in, you know?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's like if you started, like, signing your name as, like, Cornwall.
Like, cold.
Like, started tonight.
Yeah.
It would take it a while, right?
It would take a minute or two.
Yeah.
I forget that Devon is a place sometimes.
I'm just like, that's my friend.
Sometimes they mention Devon on the news.
I'm like, oh, no!
Oh, yeah, it's fine.
Devon is a place on Earth.
Yeah.
Who knew?
But, yeah, so we will be hanging out.
You can circulate.
You can come say hi.
You know, and probably since this is the third night, some of us may be around the nearest pub.
I don't know.
I think it's around the corner.
So, yeah, just come and hang out.
And thank you so much for coming out.
Thank you so much for watching on the live stream.
It's, like, it makes it incredible to do this.
You guys are, like, the best audience and the best fans, and I appreciate it so much.
And, like, I said this last night.
Like, in times that suck as much as these do, it's a real tonic, you know?
And, like, I hope we can kind of give you back the kind of good feeling you give us, you know?
Yeah.
Let's be sincere.
Let's be sincere for a minute.
Yeah.
Do you have anything?
I mean, I, just to steal it from you again, just for a little bit, it's like, I got asked
to give a corporate talk, right, about what it's like to be trans in Britain in 2024.
And there's, like, I remember...
She brought a bag lunch to the talk.
That's clever.
I, like, to, like, this is my first time.
I didn't think I was, like, palatable to, like, corporate clients, but one of them asked me.
And, uh, as a comedian, there's an obvious joke that you write in your head, right, which is two slides.
First slide, what's it like to be trans in the United Kingdom in 2024?
Next slide, 700-point font shit.
Right.
3D printing a gun right now.
But, but, it's not true, right?
Like, the actual, the actual thing I would say there is, what's it like to be trans in the United Kingdom in 2024?
It fucking rules, right?
Like, it does.
And despite every attempt to make it suck, every single one of them, no weapon formed against us can prosper, right?
Because the baseline experience of being trans is so good that it just kind of, it water off a duck's back, you know?
And all of this shit is gonna, like, pass away in time and we're still gonna fucking be here.
It's fucking right.
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
That, um, that line gets less applause in, like, a corporate office.
Weirdly, it got a lot when you did it at MI6.
Mm.
Well, those, those are some real fans, you know?
And thank you to, to you guys, you know, like, you really, like, do the most.
Watching the live stream now and always.
Like, extra legally the most.
Yeah.
And always.
Um, no, it is, it is very, like, very heartening.
Especially, like, the number of people who came up to us the last couple of nights as we're
signing stuff and going, like, I came out because of your podcast.
Mm.
And I'm just like, oh, hell yeah.
Like, we are recruiting.
We're building.
I can't guarantee I will be there when all of you get your pussy.
But in spirit.
Yeah, yeah.
It's spirit.
Yeah.
People expect a political statement out of me because I made one on the first night of
Charlie's Angels live streams.
But, like, fortunately, there's, there's not a lot that's going on right now that really
requires comment.
No.
I go in and think, so I like to give my time up for an impassioned plea to get involved
in direct action and organizing.
Okay?
You know what?
You know what you should do?
3D print a ballot box.
And then vote.
Get involved in non-electoral politics.
3D print a big placard with a protest sign.
We deserve better than this.
We do.
We deserve better than every four years getting to pick who has the vaguely best ideas.
Okay?
We want people who are willing to say something like, transgender people have always been part
of society.
That there is no Great Britain without trans people.
There never has been.
There never fucking will be.
We will always be picked.
And if I can go further even than that, we need people who are willing to say,
out loud, that not only is immigration a natural good, a natural consequence of human civilization,
a completely ordinary and standard thing.
Not only is it just that, but it is an active good that makes this country better.
It makes it a more enjoyable place to live.
Damn right.
And there is nobody working in electoral politics right now that is interested in advancing that
statement.
Nobody fucking tall.
Not the leader of the opposition.
Not any of the other motherfuckers.
None of the Greens are even happy to go and say, no.
Immigration, not only is it normal, it's good.
It's actively good.
It's something that should be encouraged.
And...
People are willing to say this.
Normal people are willing to say this.
People, I'm not going to call myself normal, but normal people are willing to say this.
And where are they?
They're in unions right now.
They're in tenants' unions like Acorn.
They're in workplace unions, you know, like IRMT or whatever like.
Get involved.
We need you.
We need your time.
Not just your money.
Don't donate money.
We've got enough.
It's fine.
What we need is genuine human effort from every one of you.
A better future is possible.
It's right there.
Join me.
Mmm.
I...
And while I'm here, Falasdine Hurrah!
That's all I had.
Nice.
I think it was moderate.
I think it was centrist.
Responsible, yeah.
Beautiful.
Beautiful.
Okay.
I tried to hit a balance.
Yeah, I remember some like old man a while back saying something along the lines of like,
we are many, they are few.
Yeah, rise like lions I believe was the phrase he had.
Inconquerable number.
Which is a weird note to end a podcast about Johnny English strikes again.
On.
I guess all I've got to say then is, to thine own self be true.
True.
That being the case, it only remains for me to say, we have been Kill James Bond.
Goodbye English.
Goodbye Internet.
Thank you.
Thank you so much for coming out for your support today, last night, the night before and always.
We hope to continue to receive it in future.
It's a pleasure, it's a delight, it's an honor.
We have been Kill James Bond.
Good night.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.
