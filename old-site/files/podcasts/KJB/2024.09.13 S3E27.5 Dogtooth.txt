a large cloth used to keep sunlight out of a room. For example, I am going to get up and draw the podcast.
Hello and welcome to another bonus episode of Kill James Bond. I'm November Kelly. I'm joined as always by my friends Abigail Thorne and Devon.
Hey.
Hey, how we doing?
The bonus is a special episode that we released because you pay for it. We're very grateful for you doing so. Example, you are now listening to this bonus episode. I've wanted to do this for a while. We're talking about Dogtooth.
That's right, baby.
Dogtooth is, I think, one of my favorite films. It's once again, you're going to get hit with a film that Nova is enthusiastic about, I'm afraid.
It's what I'm here for, honestly.
Yeah, it was really good. I really liked it.
It's one of my favorite films. It's a film about being transgender.
Yes.
Actually, it's a film about a bunch of things because it's a Yorgos Lanthimos film and Yorgos Lanthimos doesn't like being too definitive about his films. If you like read him being interviewed about any of them, he's like, I don't like to say that it's like an allegory.
I don't like to say it's like about this exactly. And I think one of the things we're going to get into when we talk about Dogtooth is about kind of like slightly swerving the intended meaning of something or the precise definition of something.
But it is definitely about being transgender.
Yes.
And the reason why we're doing all these bits to start with is because Dogtooth begins with a series of kind of... Do you remember, like, if you're of an age for this, language learning tapes?
Yes.
No.
Of course not. No. Okay. So it's kind of like, it's kind of like a podcast, but like, say you're in your like French class or whatever, you would just like listen to like a cassette tape of somebody speaking in like French.
And they would have a bunch of like sentences designed to aid language learning that would be very, very elementary. Right.
It's what like Duolingo was before it was the owl. Yes.
You'd get like a tape and it would play and it would be like, chat, chat, chat on the bat.
Like, but in French, obviously.
Exactly.
And it would like teach you language.
You shouldn't play anymore. Yeah. And so we start with one of these tapes with new vocabulary.
And we've mentioned before about Fremdung's effect, right? This technique of like alienating you from the thing that you're watching.
You want some fucking Fremdung's effect. We come out out of the gate with some of it because all of the words that we learn are wrong.
Yep.
Yes.
We get definitions of sea and motorway and excursion and they're all wrong. They're all wrong.
Like excursion is defined as a particularly strong material. And the example sentence is like, the chandelier fell off the ceiling but was not damaged because it was made of excursion.
Yes.
Like, what the fuck is happening?
My favorite and I think the most poetic is when they define carbine. A carbine is a beautiful white bird.
And there is something slightly poetic about it. It feels like a metaphor that's not connecting, you know?
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
And we have three young people in a bathroom just listening to these tapes.
They don't have names as far as I know.
No, no.
Not in the script. There's two girls and a boy. I called them son, eldest, and middle.
I believe that that is what the movie even calls them at some points. I was waiting to hear a name to like start taking the notes of it.
And I believe that they are just referred to as like, eldest, youngest, and son.
Yeah, they're never referred to by name in this.
They are not given names. They don't have names.
Also, and we may as well just start this straight away. If there's like camera shit, there's directorial, there's cinema happening in this.
Oh, they're doing cinema right now, yeah.
Because eldest is not seen in this scene. It's like POV, you are eldest. And the camera is just on youngest.
Mm-hmm.
As she suggests that they play a game in the bathroom, the three of them, these three siblings, of running their fingers under the hot tap for as long as they can stand it and then taking it out.
Yes. From this we gain two things. A, these definitions are wrong, which means that someone doesn't want these kids to know what these words actually mean. And B, fuck are they bored. Holy shit are they bored.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
And they're just kind of inventing games for each other. And then just to throw you off a bit more,
we go to a completely different scene where a woman wearing a blindfold is being driven in a Mercedes. She's wearing a security uniform.
Interesting that the security thing on her shoulder is in English, by the way, because it's a Greek film. All the dialogue is in Greek. It's why I don't have any drops for it.
Mm-hmm.
But she's like being driven somewhere with a blindfold on so she can't see where she's going. And the guy driving the car is like asking her about whether she likes the music that's on the radio, which is like really obnoxious, kind of sentimental.
Mm-hmm.
Like Greek singer.
And again, we get like some cinemas happening. Some directors is in the scene because the camera is just one angle. It's just on the lady's name is Christina.
It's just on the back three quarter view of her head from the backseat the entire time. We don't even see the man yet. It's all on her. And I've written something down here, which kind of tells us a little bit about the style of acting that we're seeing.
I don't know where this quote comes from, but I've always found it to be quite useful. And it's just because they call action doesn't mean you have to do anything.
That's right, baby.
And that is frequently what's happening in this movie is that the camera will just sit and just look at a person and that we won't get any cuts. We will get any shots. And the person will just do nothing.
Yes.
A lot of the acting is just that.
This is a directorial and acting style with which I really vibe. I love this shit.
I love this shit.
As I understand it, our boy Yogos likes to do this a lot. This is the first film of his that I've seen. Probably won't be the last.
It's mine too, yeah.
But apparently he does this a lot. He likes to work with people who aren't very trained actors.
Yes.
There's an interview that you linked us to, Vem, where he talks about he doesn't like seeing actors who've clearly developed a plan.
And that he likes to cast. One of the actors in this is just a singer. She's never acted before.
The younger sister, married Sony. R.I.P.
Yeah. And they don't like to do a lot of prep. They don't like to do a lot of rehearsals.
It's just like, just get in there and vibe it. It's very like devised theatre.
Yes.
Which is a style of working and a style of acting.
Which it's not one that I do a lot of. So I'm like quite intrigued by this style and by the kind of quite good results that it gets.
I think it relies on very good casting.
Yes.
But it's very instinctive.
So we see the man who's driving her as he gets out of the Mercedes to unlock a gate over the road.
This kind of older, alarmingly bald kind of paunchy man.
This is dad.
Yes.
This is dad.
And he drives her to this very secluded house.
And the gate closes behind her.
It's like, you know, high fences, high walls.
It's not overlooked by anything.
And do you remember the bit in Audition, right?
Where the dad is kind of like setting up his son to like have sex, right?
He's like, I'm just going to take the dog for a like 30 to 45 minute walk around the block kind of thing.
We kind of carry that a step further here.
Yeah.
He just, he sort of, we get the shot of him like him and Christine coming into the room with the son.
The son is sat there.
I would call him excited.
He's sort of like, like he's just sitting there waiting basically.
And then they come in.
Not effusively.
I would say he's exercising as well.
He's doing the like.
On pins maybe would be a better way of putting it than excited.
Yeah.
He's clearly waiting for it to occur.
This is a scheduled appointment.
It's not a surprise.
Yes, 100%.
I love the, again, cinema shots is that the camera is, again, one shot, one angle.
We don't move.
And the camera is framed such that as Christina and dad walk into the room, their heads are cut off.
And then the son stands up to greet them and his head is cut off too.
Yes.
It's very impersonal.
There's like not a lot of humanity here.
And again, with their heads framed out, like dad leaves the room.
The cheap joke about the kind of violence of like cinema, of like photography, right?
I shoot people and sometimes I cut their heads off, right?
Yeah.
So dad leaves the room and Christina and the son just undress, get completely naked.
She fluffs him.
She gets him hard.
And then they fuck.
Like, I wouldn't even use the word fuck.
Fuck to me denotes a degree of passion and intensity and desire.
They have sex.
Intercourse, I think, would be the word that I would use.
Clinically, I believe, yeah.
Clinical is an excellent word for this, especially since all of the siblings we've seen have mostly been wearing white so far.
I was going to get into the white, yeah.
Like all of the buildings are as well.
Like the internals are all white.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's very, very sterile, very clinical.
I should also say about the sex scenes, because there are a few sex scenes in this, and all of them, to the best of my knowledge, are unsimulated.
Which is to say that the actors are like doing the sex themselves, right?
There's no prosthesis involved.
There's no camera trickery.
There certainly doesn't appear to be a prosthesis involved.
No.
Yeah.
It's either extremely well-disguised or this is real.
And it's like, I don't think you can do that.
No, I mean, this is interesting, because Yorgoslav in his later career has been one of the kind of biggest adopters of intimacy coordinators.
Like he's talked a lot about how on poor things it was kind of like an important part of the process.
This being 2009, right, before intimacy coordinators were invented, it's just, I think, something that follows from this devised theatre thing, right, of being very instinctual.
And that's, it's very high risk, let's say.
Yes, it is.
I think in this instance, it like comes off.
I think it's successful.
I mean.
So to speak.
Yeah, I mean, I can't speak for the actors, right, but like as a kind of viewer of it, I think it works, right?
Yeah, that's the sort of thing now that would be putting it mildly frowned upon.
Yes.
It would be considered deeply unethical to do this to your actors, to expect an actor to do that when you're like their employer would be considered risky is a good word.
Yes.
I did go looking to see if any of the actors had like said or written anything about this.
And I did find a couple of interviews with Angelica Papalia, who's the like older sister, who is very, very positive about this because of, you know, this kind of like she's a theatre director and actor like by profession and by training.
And so took it as this kind of like very collaborative, very like instinctual thing.
This is something that I think if we watch more early Lanthimos films, if we watch Alps, which I'd like to do at some point, you'll see more of with her specifically.
So at least she was like all in on this, but difficult to say, you know, and the fact that it's discomforting now, I think it's discomforting at the time too.
It's meant to be.
It's one of the things this is a really alienating scene.
This scene is absolutely not meant to be comforting in any way.
Like this is, it definitely like goes towards the effect of the scene, which is what the fuck is happening?
Because we're two scenes into this, right?
Yeah.
And we've seen the father sort of like very grossly like kind of set up his son to have sex with this woman that he has brought her.
Yeah.
When he walks into the room of his son, he also like doesn't greet him in any way.
He just stands there and waits for him to finish the activity he was doing.
And then just like starts talking like there's no hello.
There's nothing nice.
The son, short, like blonde hair, slightly ripped.
Right.
And it's interesting, right?
We're already establishing this is, it's kind of the fascist like propaganda body, right?
Like plausibly you could put him on like a kind of like SS poster, except that the fascist propaganda body is like kind of awkward and a little bit impotent and more than anything childish.
Right.
Right.
There's a shock.
Yes.
As they're having intercourse of the headboard of his bed, which is covered in stickers, like, you know, like you would give to a child.
Yeah.
He's got this really profound like sadness and lack of comfort on his face the whole movie.
Like this actor is, I don't know if maybe the actor just looks like that and that was why he was cast or he's doing something, but it works so well.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He seems, I think, younger than the actor is.
Yeah, definitely.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He has the kind of affect of a teenager, which is very interesting.
I mean, all three of them do.
Age in this movie is so interesting because these are clearly like shot as kids, but the actors are in their like twenties.
The older sister's like probably in her early thirties.
Yeah.
And it's, it's never like addressed formally.
Yeah.
How old they are.
It's really good, like script work and acting, how childishly they like act and seem, you know?
Mm-hmm.
So having had this like very clinical, very detached sex, Christina goes to like sit down in the other room with the older sister and they talk.
And it's like a language learning type.
It's like Duolingo again.
They talk about food and it's very like kind of form sentences.
One of them says, the older sister says, burgers is one of my favorite meals.
Right.
Which is, you wouldn't really say this.
It's stilted.
It's unnatural.
Right.
Burgers is one of my favorite meals.
Yeah.
To be fair.
It's up there.
Burgers is good as hell.
But if you're saying burgers is one of my favorite meals and the response is like, I like fish soup and cakes.
Then you think, oh, this is, you know, this use of language here is slightly strange, you know?
Yeah.
It's a little bit like, do you get to the cloud district very often?
Like it's just, it's just a bit.
It is a little.
Do you know what I mean?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
And we see Christina like sits with both sisters who are sitting there very, very creepily.
Every time they're together, it's kind of like a visual read of like the twins from The Shining.
It's, they're looking real creepy.
And the dad like takes a home video, a camcorder of all three of the kids and her.
She stops to like tell her to smile more and she puts on this really like full smile.
And it's like, hmm, this is, this is uncomfortable.
Yeah.
This is weird.
And after this, Christina is paid, blindfolded again and then driven home.
Mm-hmm.
Purely, purely transactional.
We then go back to the kids who are like learning some more from their tapes.
They have a maths lesson in which every angle in a triangle is like impossibly wrong.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
All of the maths is wrong as well.
So we're not just, we're not just deforming language here.
We're also like the numbers as well.
Mm-hmm.
This is intercut with, we see the younger sister is torturing a Barbie.
Yes, she is.
Yeah.
There's a scene quite like this in Gretchen Felker Martin's novel Cuckoo, which made me for a
while think that these kids were in a conversion therapy camp.
Mm-hmm.
Because in that novel, a bunch of kids get sent to a conversion therapy camp and they
are also set like-
Yeah, yeah.
Maths problems that are impossible.
They're taught like English and biology lessons that are like wrong.
Not just in the sense that it's like, oh, biology, like, just one male and female, right?
No, like crazy-
Fully wrong.
Fully wrong, like.
So, yeah, it's very interesting.
It's like a deliberate weakening of the brain by just pouring nonsense into it.
Yeah.
Yeah, I wouldn't say that this is very far detached from a conversion therapy camp at all.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's really a good read there.
It's just like if two trains leave Hamburg, one's going 50 miles an hour and the other's
like seven dogs in a trench coat, how much is the budget of Tomb Raider 3?
It's like, so what?
Like, calculate the angle of the budget.
What?
Like, it hurts your brain to try and think.
Take a trench line from a fence until dark.
Yeah.
And it's interesting, too, because it gets you thinking.
It's intentionally destabilizing.
It gets you thinking about like, what world is this?
Like, what's the fucking conceit here?
And I think one of the recurring things is that Alantinos and the script writer for those
whose name I shamefully don't remember, but who also did Alps, like doing, is not telling
you stuff.
Keeping you as in the dark as possible, which fits very much with this movie, too.
We also see that the family has dinner.
Mom is also here.
And one of the kids, I think it's the youngest, says, oh, mom, can you pass me the phone?
And she passes her the salt.
So like their words have all been like fucked up.
My notes say, what kind of Professor X school slash conversion therapy camp is this fucking
guy operating?
It's beautiful, too, when she does that, because it's a little way into the conversation.
And it means that they've given like the father a kind of a shopping stride of stuff that they
need.
And like antihistamines, bandages, tint for your eyebrows.
And it's now that she's used a word that is wrong.
You go back and think, well, what the fuck?
Yeah, like what is any of the rest of that?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You introduced like total confusion to the thing because nothing is necessarily what it's
supposed to be.
You get a real sense of what exactly they're being deprived of with which words are being
used wrongly.
Like telephone is a really key one.
Like these children are in a the village situation where it's just one house.
Yes.
Yes.
Which, oh, I really, I really like this.
I really like experimenting with the ways in which like parents build the reality of their
children.
And I want to talk about that extended later on.
Yes.
I need a few more pieces to put together.
It's also very much a film about child abuse, right?
Yes.
Like a big trigger warning for that on the front of this.
Because like, again, if you're denying your child the kind of ability to even know the
word telephone, right?
If you're hindering their ability to communicate, then even aside from keeping them like cloistered,
that is a bad fucking sign.
Yeah.
I mean, the term it brought to mind for me is a philosophy term, hermeneutical injustice,
which is when you deprive somebody of the concepts that they need to take control of their own
life.
So for example, section 28 would be a classic example of hermeneutical injustice.
Like an entire generation of British kids were simply not given the concept of queerness.
And therefore their development, the ones who were queer, was stunted.
You know, that's partly why I didn't come out for such a long time, is I didn't know what
a trans person was until I was 19.
Yeah.
Because it was illegal to tell us, right?
So yeah, that is what the film is showing us, is these kids are being denied the knowledge
that they need to control their own lives.
It's a film about being transgender, amongst other things.
So we see that the kids are engaged, we see what the stickers are about, right?
Because the stickers are a reward for good behavior.
And as a reward, the one who gets the most stickers is allowed to choose what they do
that evening for entertainment.
And the son, in what is kind of lightly implied to be a kind of rigged in his favor contest,
wins and gets to choose the entertainment, for which he chooses watching a home video.
And it's another video of them, and we see as they're watching it, that the younger sister
is like mouthing along, because they've seen it so many times, she knows the words.
And it's like, this is the kind of like, this is what they're watching, right?
Yeah, it's very odd.
Yeah, we're kind of like sabotaging the existence of like, it's an ordinary living room, it's
got like a TV in it, and it's like, well, what's this for?
But it's for watching like, home videos that your dad has taken that are quite creepy,
you know?
Yes.
Rather than anything else.
It has another use later.
And the son washes the family car, and then he goes and he talks to the hedge.
The whole compound is surrounded by this very tall hedge and fence.
He talks to the hedge, and he says to it that he's proud of doing his chores well.
And he says, I wish you could have seen it.
And then he starts picking up rocks and throwing them over the hedge.
And his parents see him doing this, and bring him in and like, say, what the fuck is all
this about then?
And he says, my brother threw the rocks at me first.
And then mum immediately says, that's not true.
And we get this interesting moment where the son, without being told he has to, drinks mouthwash
and holds it in his mouth.
Oh, this fucking scene.
Until it burns.
This fucking scene.
The thing is, the opening shot of that scene is the bottle of Listerine mouthwash up close,
but it has no label on it.
Like, you recognize it from the shape of the bottle, right?
It's quite a common object that has been kind of like, it's been ad busted, right?
There's no branding on it whatsoever.
This, but the dad is like a kind of left wing figure.
You know, he's like, I'm ad busting my kids.
Yeah.
Like, this, I'm going to raise my kids without brands.
All right.
Yeah.
As we see later on in a cutaway bit, like he is in fact removing the labels from all
the bottles of everything he brings.
Yes.
Yeah.
That's a perfect little, like the way that's structured in the film as well, that we see
this first and we're like, the fuck that's a Listerine.
And then later on we see him like stop the car on the way home and painstakingly cut the
labels off of everything.
But it's interesting that he does this as soon as mum says that's not true.
He does this without being told.
It's implied that like, this is such a commonplace punishment to just hold mouthwash in your
mouth until it burns, until mum is just like, no, now you can spit it out.
It's so like, yeah.
And it's sadistic, but it's also clinical, the kind of like antiseptic nature of Listerine
as well.
Like it's, it's like a thing about like hygiene.
Yeah.
I make the joke about the left wing thing.
This is, I think, more and more explicitly a kind of fascist aligned thing.
Right.
And not for nothing that I know that Greece was a military dictatorship for a number of
decades.
Right.
Yeah.
But, but there's an interesting practical real world problem, which I'm, I'm glad that
the movie thinks of and thinks to incorporate here, which is that the next day as dad is
going to work and all the children and mum are gathered to say goodbye, a plane flies
over the house.
Yes.
Which is obviously not something that mum and dad can prevent.
And so the children like bicker about how if the plane falls and we don't really know
what this means yet, which one of them is going to get it and violence intercedes.
And so I genuinely think Yorga Santhiwans is one of the only directors who has ever filmed
violence.
Right.
Because the kind of instinctive, like explosive nature of it.
Right.
So he's him and Michael Harnica.
Right.
Because the oldest daughter says like, oh, if it falls, I'll get it.
And the mum just like full force, like slaps her across the face.
And the way this is filmed, this is like the way that violence is in these films.
It feels like being slapped across the face feels to watch.
It's like really like affronting.
Yeah.
It's interesting as well that we don't like cut into a shot of the violence and then cut
back out again.
It's all in the same shot.
And so it's just like, did that just happen?
It has that quality of like, what the fuck was that?
Like the kind of absurdity of violence that like, yeah.
Zero to a hundred to zero.
And mum says, whoever deserves it will get it.
It's like, what the fuck is that?
What are they doing?
This is an entirely like habituated form of violence.
Right.
Like it's, it hasn't lost any of its power or it's kind of like spontaneity for that.
But this is clearly a kind of like living situation in which violence is absolutely common.
Right.
So dad goes to work at the factory where they make room tone.
Yeah.
He, this is a really good choice.
I love this because what, what the dad does, the dad has to leave because he's like in charge
of all of this.
He's got to get the money somehow.
This is his little hermetically sealed world.
And where he goes, when he goes to work is dismal.
It's fucking disgraceful.
He's in this little factory and every shot of the outside of it, like every establishing
shot is so miserable.
Evenly like the same, like clinical, like it's all white.
It's not dirty so much.
It's like, like monolithic.
Have you ever like looked at the factory and just like really tried to take in the scale
of it?
It's shots like that.
It's not entirely clear.
Like what, what it is that they do here other than like make you listen to a lot of room
tone.
But he passes Christina on his way in, like waves and says, hello.
We established that dad's boss doesn't know this because they have this conversation about
like, oh, really sorry.
Like, yeah, you've got to come over for a beer sometime.
Like, oh, your wife, she uses a wheelchair.
She can't leave the house, which we know is a lie.
Right.
And so they have this, they have this excuse.
But this is also brilliant world building.
Right.
And that it just, it's a little bit of extra reassurance along with the planes that like
the outside world, normal, right?
Like completely normal.
This is a situation where like everybody's doing this, right?
This is, this is one guy and his secret Yosef Fritzlass family.
Yeah.
Um, who meanwhile, eldest and youngest are playing a game of let's chloroform ourselves
and whoever wakes up first is the winner.
These are the most bored children in the entire world.
Recreational anesthesia for fun and profit.
I mean, I do want to say also like when we see the dad at work, right?
That's the only time we ever see him contradicted, right?
Cause he's his boss, right?
They're like, they talk about which kind of tiles they like or whatever.
And the guy full force like disagrees with him and says, oh no, I like these ones.
You know, he has to like change his view.
Whereas back in the house, obviously he never has to do this.
I think that's worth noting.
It's not, it's not the only time he's defied.
That's true.
That is true.
Because we get this really nice scene where we sort of expose him as being a little bit pathetic.
That he goes to a dog obedience school.
Yes.
Where he's apparently checked in his dog.
This, this obedience school trains dogs to be guard dogs.
Yeah.
We're shown.
And we're shown this like quite vicious Doberman being, being trained to attack on command.
Yeah.
And he says, I want my, my dog back, please.
I need it back.
And the, and the guy training the dogs is like, I'm going to tell you the themes of this movie.
I love these scenes.
I love the scene where they're like, here's the, here's the movie in the mouth of just
a different guy.
He says like, I can't give you a dog back because your dog is on like a training program.
And dogs are like clay.
Every dog is wasting for us to show it how it should behave.
And do we want an animal or do we want a friend?
And then we go and see the dog Rex, which is a nice kind of like, you know, Labrador
looking thing.
And which doesn't come when he's called.
And all the dad can do is to like yell his name more and more.
Over and over.
Like 20 times.
And the dog doesn't listen.
The dog isn't moving at all.
He looks like a fucking idiot.
It's just standing there.
You're like, Rex, Rex.
He's like, he's like fucking Alan Partridge in the car park.
And like.
Fenton.
Jesus Christ.
Dad is exposed as this.
Well, like he's been built up as this kind of tyrant.
And then we see like, this guy's a fucking loser.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There is also, aside from the obvious parallels here of like, are you, are you raising your
children to be your friends or are you raising them like dogs?
The kind of radical animal rights reading of this that's possible.
That's like, hey, maybe this isn't such a good thing to do to a dog either.
You know?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, it isn't.
Also, as far as the like recreational chloroforming goes, the thing that leads into that is one
of the sisters, the oldest saying that she has like a stomach ache and the younger who
has her own little like medical room sort of like saying, you know, well, that's not
where your appendix is.
Your appendix is down here and giving her some like medical advice before like chloroforming
themselves.
And all of the medicine is correct.
Yeah.
The younger sister, the younger sister, when she was at the dinner table earlier, was asking
for like antihistamines and bandages.
And presumably those are also correct because this is functional language.
Like this is, this is useful knowledge, right?
This isn't something you want to fuck with.
And so the idea that you have a kid who doesn't know what, uh, like...
Like what angles in a fucking triangle add up to, but knows like how to utilize antihistamines.
Yeah.
Or like where the vermiform appendix is.
It's like, it's, it's really like, uh...
Yeah.
You think cervical would be far down because it sounds like cervix, but it's actually way
up here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But so the dad comes home, uh, having not retrieved the dog.
This is where we see him cut the labels off the shopping.
Mm-hmm.
Which I really like because it's sort of like, he's leading the kids to him to believe that
he's like gathering these raw materials from the world.
Like he's not at work at all.
He's out there like getting these things.
Yeah.
Hmm.
Yeah.
The most perverse sex scene in the whole movie.
This is fucked up.
Yeah.
I feel like I would understand it more if I knew what the music was.
Well, I think the music is the same kind of like crooning, like Greek bullshit that
he was listening to in the car, right?
With Christina.
Um, he comes home.
Um, he, he and his wife have sex and they really do have sex.
Like it is like intimate sort of, but in the sense that they're both listening to a walkman
with separate headphones on.
Yeah.
And this is fucking, this is fucking sick.
Sickening.
They're both listening to like Ode to Joy or some shit.
They're fascists.
They're lost in the past.
They're trying to like get a hold of this.
More than that too.
It's also that like, we're trying to keep any like outside culture, including music from
our children.
Cause they, they might overhear it.
You're so right.
Yeah.
Otherwise they just play it like on the, on the, we see that he has like a, a vinyl like
record player.
And that he's not using this in this moment is interesting.
Yeah.
I hadn't cut, I hadn't pulled that out.
Your kids might overhear like language, like actual like Greek language, you know?
Yeah.
Fascinating.
So, so they're like, you know, isolating them from that.
And they're kind of like, it's, it's solipsistic too, right?
Like you build this kind of cultural world for, for yourself and your, your wife, right?
And you exclude your children from it.
And it's a, it's a good metaphor for like that kind of process of like cultural reservation.
You know, it's like, I get to listen to this because I can be like trusted ideologically,
but you know, it might be a bad influence on you.
So Christina comes for another visit.
Well, Christina comes, but she doesn't.
So she's got some notes for the boy about it.
Yeah.
As I understood my reading of the scene, the son doesn't want to finger her or eat her
out.
Yes.
He doesn't know.
He just wants to fuck Doggy Star.
Yes.
And it's, it's not like particularly, it's selfish, but in a childish way, right?
Where, where he's like, I don't like this as much.
I like the thing we were doing before.
I like the bit that makes me feel good.
Like he just doesn't like conceptualize this as something you would do for someone else.
Yeah.
But so Christina, after having sex with him, she's clearly like,
working on this in her mind, right?
She's had this idea.
This is something that, this is a situation I can like turn to my advantage that I can
exploit here.
Yeah.
And so afterwards she, she like goes to sit down with the older sister.
The eldest has admired her headband.
Yes.
It's got little like sparkly crystals on it, you know?
Yeah.
And Christina says, well, I'll give it to you if you want, but what can you give me
in exchange?
When we get this, this quite creepy scene where she tries to trade her something for the headband.
She's like, oh, I'll give you this pencil.
It has an eraser on the end of it.
Yeah.
We see all the things that she thinks are like good and valuable in her room.
All of this tape measure.
Yeah.
What the fuck?
No, Yorgos likes making movies about getting your pussy eaten.
This is a preoccupation for him.
Take the fucking estrogen already, man.
Yeah.
And hopefully Hunter's influence can rub off on it.
The way this is filmed is it's sort of like halfway between child abuse and like putting
peanut butter on your junk and like calling a family dog over, right?
Abso-fucking-lutely.
Animal abuse.
Yes.
Yeah, absolutely.
Like this is a kind of like, this is not someone who even like speaks the language to know that
they're like, they can't consent, right?
Like they can't consent because they don't have, they have no conception of what's fucking
going on.
Yeah.
Literally actually, literally don't speak the language because as we establish like later
on, Christina at some point mentions the word pussy to someone and they ask mom like,
what, what's pussy?
And then she said, oh, it's a big light.
And we see later on, somebody uses the word keyboard to refer to pussy.
Yeah.
This is one of the best punchlines in the movie is like later on, she turns the tables on
Christina and she's like, well, how do you think my parents would, would like it if they
found out that I was licking your keyboard?
This is also why my letterboxd review of this is my favorite joke I've ever written.
I said, I love an allegory for how fascism mutilates our linguistic forms almost as much
as I love eating keyboard.
But yeah, also to be clear, these are two like adult women, right?
Yeah.
Like they're both in their like twenties, right?
Yeah.
Like they're about the same age.
The oldest daughter is I think older than Christina.
And then like, it raises the question of like, how the fuck do you groom a woman in her early
thirties?
Ask ****.
Um, and...
Ooh!
Pretty good!
Thank you.
Um, but yeah, so, so, but this, this works for Christina in the moment, right?
Like she, she gets eaten out by the older sister.
Yeah.
Meanwhile, the mum is like on the phone to the dad at work.
Yes.
A hidden phone.
Yeah.
She has to like lock herself in the bedroom and retrieve like a hidden phone to call him.
There's something very fun later on where we're like, we hear two of the two daughters
talking to each other and one of them's like, mum's not going to be here for a while, she's
in her room talking to herself again.
So like, this is something she does often.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They don't know what a phone is.
They don't know what it could be.
Telephone's the fucking salt.
Like how are they going to even know to say this?
Mm.
But we see that in having done this, right, Christina has fundamentally destabilized
the house, right?
Because now...
Yeah, she's introduced a hierarchy that you lick things you like, and unfortunately
that remains for the entire rest of the fucking movie.
This kind of like, warped, sort of childish understanding of sex enters this kind of like,
very hygienic, very like, clinical environment.
Yeah.
Yoros likes two things, right?
He likes making movies about eating pussy, and he likes making movies about incest.
Mm.
And this is the incest bit.
The first incest bit, I should say.
Yeah.
Because the older sister and the younger sister are just like, lying on a bed together.
Mm-hmm.
It's interesting, by the way, it's great storytelling that the older sister has like, a really deep,
like, big scar on her shoulder that's never explained.
Mm.
Yeah.
So, Eldest offers to trade the headband to Youngest.
If she licks her, and then it's like, she's like, where do you want me to lick you?
And there's this like, long pause as we go, oh god, no, Yorgos, please don't.
And then she goes, shoulder.
Yeah, because she doesn't know.
Yeah.
It's like a perfect joke structure too.
You set up.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But now it's time to do some stuff with Sun.
So, Sun is playing with a toy aeroplane in the garden.
Mm.
And one of his sisters, out of jealousy, snatches it from him and throws it out of the compound.
Mm.
Oh, I love this.
She runs like, four feet outside the gate.
Mm-hmm.
And then just to kind of do the sort of violence is commonplace, she then slashes her brother's
arm with a kitchen knife and runs away.
Yeah, this is the younger sister who does this.
It's actually unrelated.
The older sister takes the plane, and then for like, seemingly no reason, the younger sister
is the one who like...
I didn't even catch that.
...like, cuts him.
Wow.
Yeah, I didn't notice because all of the shots are filmed just the back of the lady's
knees, so I didn't catch, but it was different with...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, explosive violence again.
We see him get like, bandaged.
Incidentally, there's a similar like, arm bandage on the younger sister after this.
We never see how she got it, or what it's for.
Yeah.
Which I really like, because like...
It's good.
There's been some kind of like, punishment here, right?
Yeah.
You also think about the scar on the older sister, and I'm like, how many times has this
happened?
Like, how much violence are these kids like, doling out to each other?
So, Sun tells Dad about the plane.
Mm-hmm.
And it's like four feet outside the gate.
Mm-hmm.
And Dad gets in the car, drives the four feet.
The Sun is like, on the...
It's like standing at the gate.
He could like, easily just walk out and get it.
But what this teaches us is that like, these kids can't go even an inch outside the compound.
Yeah, yeah.
They're not allowed.
Dad gets in the car, drives four feet out, picks up the toy plane, reverses back and gives
it to him.
Really love that he doesn't even like, break the fiction by going out to get it himself.
Like, he maintains it.
Honestly, yeah.
He gets in the car.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
They think that you need to be in the car to leave, which will be important.
Yeah.
There's a bit where the Sun has a nightmare and you get, again, the very comic thing of
the like, large adult Sun getting into bed with his parents because he had a scary dream.
Then we get some fantastic fucking acting because the Sun is in the garden doing chores
and he sees a cat.
Yes.
And without saying anything, it is very clear from the way this actor reacts that he has
no idea what this animal is, has never seen it before and is terrified.
Yeah.
No, he's so good.
It's such good acting.
It's this like, harmless little black and white stray cat.
It's like, meow.
And he's just like, oh, fuck.
What the fuck is that?
Like, oh.
And then it cuts across and like, both the girls are like, hugging each other.
In the window of like, the front room going like, oh, oh, oh.
He reacts like he's seen the fucking Xenomorph.
And he like, stalks up to it very, very slowly.
And I'm sorry to say, listeners, kills it with a pair of garden shears.
Oh, he does so.
Yeah.
I really hope this was simulated.
Off screen, to be clear.
Oh, yeah.
I don't think they actually killed a cat for this, but like...
I also want to know how they got the cat to make those noises then.
Don't know.
I don't trust you, because you made me see a man's penis, the real one.
It was real, yeah.
So, you know.
Again, it's very Michael Harnica, it's like funny games.
Also, Parasite, a bit.
A little, yeah.
Like, this kind of very well-kept house into which, you know,
spatters of blood across the lawn.
The dad gets called at work about this, and he's like, perfect, this is a great opportunity.
Yeah.
I will use this to reinforce my control.
Yeah, how does fascism work? How did the war on terror work? How did any of this shit work?
Exactly.
And so he comes back, having stopped on the way home, to like, pour fake blood all over himself.
Like, scratch up his own clothes.
And like, slash his own clothes, yeah.
And he comes back and he's like, we are fucking under attack.
Yeah, he rids himself of this turbulent, like, fake outside son.
He's like, your brother from the outside is dead. He was torn apart by a cat.
A cat is the most dangerous thing in the entire world.
Yeah.
It's like, I found his body, he's dead. Stop throwing rocks over the fence,
stop thinking about him. Stop also throwing slices of cake over the fence for your brother,
which I saw you do earlier on.
But yeah, cats are the most fucking dangerous animals that exist, they eat children.
This is why we must hide in the house and pretend to be dogs.
Yeah, it's a ridiculous, like, obviously fake threat from a patriarchal figure, right?
But in order to scare off dogs, he gets them on all fours, barking. All of them, including his wife.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And they're like, barking, like, very aggressively, you know?
This is, you know, the sort of puppy girl wholesome shit, this is not, you know?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's militaristic, like, he's kind of like a drill instructor.
Yeah.
You know, like, you get them.
Do you want an animal or a friend?
I'll ask you over and over.
I think it borrows a couple of shots from Full Metal Jacket, in fact.
Hmm.
Yeah, actually, I think it does.
And just to seal the deal of no more talking about the son who's gone,
who also, at this point, I'm like, was he ever real?
Was there a fourth child who escaped and that's what this is?
Or is this just like some made up shit?
I don't know.
It's possible.
Is the fourth child purely rhetorical as a device for control?
Anyway, they hold a funeral by the hedge for the departed brother.
Yeah.
God, that's so good.
They're just all up against the hedge, dressed in a, like, Sunday best.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Throwing flowers over the hedge.
Throwing flowers, yeah.
One of the sisters, I think, says, I'm sorry that you felt that you had to leave and you made
a terrible mistake and it was very wrong of you, but I still miss you because you're my brother.
Mm-hmm.
And I love you.
And so it's like, they hold a funeral for their brother the way you'd hold a funeral for,
like, you know, a family member who'd committed fucking murder.
Yeah, yeah.
It's like, it's a lot of conflicted feelings of being like, oh, you did a horrible thing leaving,
but like, you're still family.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What the fuck is this?
Pornography!
Sorry, that's about it.
The experience of watching this film is like, suddenly pornography.
Oh, yeah.
You've seen Cox before?
Guess what?
Here's one again.
It's-
Yeah!
The other use of the TV, right?
In private-
Watching porn!
Watching porn!
We see that the mum and the dad are watching porn, presumably during sex, and so you get
like, sort of a half screen's worth of this porn video.
Mm.
Okay, this is kind of perverse, right?
Like, not just in the obvious way, but also, like, again, we've introduced this TV
that you use for home movies and porn, and sort of like, nothing else.
Slightly hypocritical of the film to tell me that like, oh, watching images of people,
fuck, that's bad and creepy and weird.
I'm like, Yorgos, you just made me do that!
I don't think it's anti-porn, right?
I think it kind of views it as like, empty calories.
Uh, and I think it also is like, part of the objection here is that it's something that like,
you can't watch anything on this.
It's something for us to do as like, an instrument of social control, and then we can use it recreationally,
but only in secret, you know?
Mm-hmm.
Okay, yeah.
And so, the mum is pregnant.
Um, and so...
What, is she?
That's what she says.
She says she is.
Mm-hmm.
She does say it, yeah.
This scene is, she says it to dad in private, but the way this is acted, it's like, are you
talking within the fictional quantifier of like, this is what the deal is?
It sort of seems like they're negotiating it a little, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Because she says I'm pregnant, it's twins, a girl and a boy, and he goes, what if it's
triplets?
And she goes, that's excessive.
So it's like, are you inventing the narrative together, or are you seriously pregnant?
Like...
Impossible to say.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No way to know.
But so, he announces to the kids, in a few months your mother will give birth to two
children and a dog, right?
Like, this is, again, we're sort of like, we're fucking up some basic biology here, you know?
Yeah.
Like, and we're introducing this profound strangeness.
It's like, yeah, your mum can do this.
And because the kids are like, annoyed about this, because they're gonna have to share their
rooms, she's like, if your behaviour improves, I might not get pregnant.
Or I might not give birth.
Yeah.
Wild.
It's so fucking weird.
It's so weird.
At this point we find out what the planes are all about, because another plane flies over
the house and let mum and dad, with a wink and a nod, signal.
Mum, unseen, throws a toy plane into the garden.
And then dad goes, oh, a plane!
A plane's gone overhead, it just fell in the garden!
And they all race to go and get it.
And it's like, oh my fucking god.
It's all part of the narrative.
They've thought of everything!
I really, really like the way that, like, even the things that would traditionally break
the narrative have been used to reinforce it.
Yeah.
Like, it's very well thought out on the part of the dad here.
And the mum.
I guess the mum is probably involved.
So at this point we have to have some more incest sex.
Oh yeah.
Hmm.
Well, it's not even sex!
They don't know enough, they don't know about the pussy!
It's a keyboard!
It's like, intimate though, in the sense that it's like the Helimity tweet,
you know, T4T isn't...
It's like two sisters locked in an attic for decades together.
These are the two sisters being locked in an attic together, right?
Yeah.
It starts out in the kind of transactional way of,
like, I'll give you a headband if you lick my shoulder or whatever.
Except this time the older sister doesn't have anything to give,
and the younger sister is like, that's fine, it doesn't matter.
Right?
And she like, licks her inner thigh in something that is like, proximately sexual.
Yes.
And it's like, this is like, very weird and very discomforting,
but it's also a moment of like, genuine human connection between them.
Mm-hmm.
In the form of incest sex.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah.
This is like, again...
With the tools they've been given to understand the world,
this is an intimate thing between sisters for them to do.
Mm-hmm.
But, yeah.
To Lantimos, this is an interesting deformation of the need for human connection,
right?
Something he'll come back to a lot, is, yeah, why not try and fuck your sister?
Why not try and fuck your dad?
This is because you're looking for something and you don't have those boundaries, right?
I've been spending too much time on 4chan again, remember?
Yeah.
Fucking TTTTS, filmmaker.
Take the estrogen.
Greek repressor here.
It wasn't that good.
Ah.
It wasn't good enough for me to try again.
Dad engages in some more pathetic theatre where he puts fish in the pool and then, like,
waits for the daughter to discover them and then hunts the fish in the pool with a speargun.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So almost literally shooting fish in a barrel.
Mm-hmm.
It's like, what the fuck?
Mm-hmm.
It's ridiculous.
We've manufactured these, like, enemies and stuff.
Also, Anton Chekhov's gonna be very angry about this speargun because you think,
oh, speargun!
Oh!
Oh, Dad's gonna get got with that speargun at the end!
Nah.
It doesn't come back.
That would be far too big an event.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
And we see that they have a little litany at dinner, right?
Mm-hmm.
They do.
Which is very weird and misogynistic, I should also say.
Where it's like, you know, a man's most productive years, the father is, like, drilling,
like, testing them on this, between 30 and 40, a woman's most productive years between 20 and 30.
When is a child old enough to leave the house?
And the answer is, when the first, like, dog tooth, canine tooth, like, falls out.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Dog tooth, by the way, interesting.
It's the same in the Greek, kinodontos.
It's like, wrong, right?
It's not how you name that.
It's not the name of the thing.
But at one of these interviews with Thelon Themos, he's like, I didn't want to call it canine tooth,
because that's correct.
You know, it's scientific.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Dog tooth is like, it means some other things.
There's like a dog tooth fish, there's like a dog tooth, like, design pattern, but it doesn't
mean exactly the thing it's supposed to mean, and it feels wrong.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, completely.
Yeah.
There's a dog tooth wave as well, isn't there?
I think so.
There is, yeah.
It's a waveform, and I think the film opens with some stills of waveforms too, which I assumed
were dog tooth waveforms.
Yeah, well, that is.
Anybody, if that's supposed to, yeah.
I've been mulling getting a tattoo of that fucking waveform.
Mm-hmm.
It's a cool waveform.
So a child is ready to leave the home when the dog tooth falls out, which of course-
We know, but it doesn't.
It never does.
Mm-hmm.
And of course, when you're ready to leave the home, you have to learn to drive, right?
Mm-hmm.
But when are you ready to learn how to drive?
Mm-hmm.
When the dog tooth grows back?
Mm-hmm.
Which of course it never does.
Of course.
Absolutely.
What's a pussy?
It's a big lie.
Who's Frank Sinatra?
He's your granddad.
Yes.
He's your fucking granddad.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
This fucking bit, because he's like, do you want to hear your grandfather sing?
And so he puts on a Frank Sinatra record, and because it's in English-
Fly Me To The Moon.
Yeah.
Because it's in English, which none of them speak, he interprets for them in Greek.
Yeah.
And he's just not right.
Not at all, right?
No.
Just saying other things.
Yeah.
He makes it a song about like, I love my family.
I'll always try hard.
I'll never leave home.
And it's like, what the fuck?
My house, I love you.
I will never leave you.
I really like this.
Yeah.
They dance as well.
And they're terrible dancers.
Yeah.
They suck.
Because they've had no outside influence on it.
They're just moving their body rhythmically.
There's no-
It's a beautiful, beautiful devised theatre prompt here of dance like someone who has never
seen anyone else dance, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's just kind of like jerking, like kind of rhythmic movements.
Yeah.
So, Christina comes back.
Yes.
By the way, in the son's room, there's a portrait of the father, which looks very dictatorial.
It's being slowly painted in.
Mm-hmm.
And she says, I saw you in one of my dreams.
Do you even have dreams?
And we see that his dreams, he says, oh yeah, I had a dream.
My mum fell in the pool.
She goes, like, and then what?
And it's like, nothing.
That was it.
Oh.
That's like, you have hindered this like boy's linguistic capacity so much that like it has
affected his imagination.
Yeah.
He can't even dream.
And in contrast, Christina's like, oh, in my dream, like I was walking in the woods with
your dad and they're like birds and stuff.
And then you were there and you were a zombie.
It was crazy.
Hey, you've like foreclosed his imagination.
Yeah.
She's like, I gotta stop swallowing my prog.
I gotta boof that shit.
When I swallow it, it gives me crazy dreams.
She says she dreamed that he was a zombie, which gives you a little comic payoff later
on where he asks his mom what a zombie is and she tells him it's a little yellow flower.
And the light is.
Oh, yeah.
I want to talk about that scene.
Mm-hmm.
Well, let's talk about it now, in fact.
And so all throughout the film, the lighting has been very soft.
Mm-hmm.
It's very desaturated.
Yeah.
And the colors are very muted.
Yes.
And then for reasons I haven't been able to figure out, just in this one scene where
the son asks mom what a zombie is and she says it's a small flower, there's very,
very harsh sunlight on his face and casting a very stark shadow.
And I'm not entirely sure what Yorgos is trying to say there.
Maybe it was just like my lighting director wasn't in that day.
Mm-hmm.
But I noticed it.
I noticed it and I'm like, ah, yeah, what is the film doing here?
Mm-hmm.
I don't know.
It's like dissent is introduced.
Yeah, outside influence I think is.
Mm-hmm.
So, right in if you know what the lighting in that one scene was about.
So she goes to the eldest daughter again for sex.
And the eldest daughter is able to turn it around on her.
And this is where she pulls the light, you know,
what would my parents do if they found out I was licking your keyboard.
Mm-hmm.
And she goes through her bag, Christina's bag, to see if there's anything that she wants.
And what she has in there is three, like two rental videotapes.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Object of fucking power.
Right?
Yeah.
We don't yet find out what they are.
We find out in a very fun way.
Yes.
And she kind of blackmails Christina for like a week with these videotapes.
Mm-hmm.
That she doesn't even know what they are, right?
Mm-hmm.
She recognizes a videotape.
Yeah, yeah.
Which isn't like...
Because of the home movies.
Yeah.
And so she watches them secretly at night.
We still don't see what they are.
This is a beautiful, beautiful shot.
I think consciously evokes Anna Karina in Viva Savi at the cinema, right?
We see her looking at the TV, the fucking TV glow.
And she's just looking at static, right?
Because clearly she has finished the movie.
Mm-hmm.
And is just there in silence, like digesting it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
You have seen a film for the first time ever.
You have just experienced outside influence.
Yeah.
And it's so good.
It's so good.
It's so good.
And she conceals this from death.
Yes.
Yeah.
He comes down and says, what are you doing?
She says, oh, I couldn't sleep.
And then hides the tapes, right?
And then the next morning, we see her, she's brushing her teeth and going about her day, like,
playing and almost like rehearsing a conversation that she wants to have with her dad, where
she says, I want to be a fighter.
I want to be like Mr. Balboa.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
She's pretending to be Rocky in her bathroom mirror, and she's like doing her teeth and being like,
oh, one of the tapes was fucking Rocky Balboa.
Yeah.
She's so Rocky.
It's so fucking cute.
And the thing is, right, one of the reasons why I love this movie, I'm like the Academy,
right?
I love movies about how important movies are.
And this is one of those.
You know my opinion.
This is the whole medium contorting itself to suck itself off, right?
To be like, this is emancipatory, this medium that we have in front of us, right?
Yeah.
Even just Rocky, even just seeing Rocky in a lifetime of never having seen a movie before,
and it gives you so many tools.
Like, I really love her acting as so fucking goodness, because she's faking being Rocky,
she's doing the weird mouth thing, and be like, ugh, ugh, and then like,
she's like, shut up, Oxi!
To be clear, we've said before...
The way a child would do after watching a movie they thought was cool.
Like, the way I remember doing on the way home from Marvel films,
would be like, just, like, good.
Really, really good.
And a lot of the stuff is trash.
That was last week.
It's trash, right?
Like, we'll do Rocky, I'm sure, and I'm probably going to be like,
this fucking sucks.
But the thing is, right, it doesn't matter.
And it does!
It doesn't matter.
The original Rocky's great.
And it introduces an uncontrolled element, right?
Not least because it introduces the concept of righteous violence, but also because,
like, Yorgos fucking loves action movies.
He's an action movie guy.
I found a quote from him about how he really enjoyed, um, uh, like, the Bourne...
The Bourne...
The Bourne Ultimatum.
Does he know he can make them?
Is he aware that he's allowed to make action movies himself?
Listen, if you ask me, give the next Bond film to one director, hands down.
Yorgos would be very funny.
Yeah, that's Bond.
Yeah, fuck it.
Hands fucking down.
Well, Bourne Ultimatum, we gave it an 8 out of...
On the scum schism, so that's pretty fucking good, yeah.
It was pretty good, I just don't know what the ultimatum was.
Like...
Commit to this program!
Yeah!
And then we see them in the pool, right?
Where they've been...
Yeah, I love this!
This is so fucking good.
It's like, joyous, right?
Like, after this completely antiseptic thing, this riotously funny bit where she's like...
She does the shark from Jaws...
She reenacts Jaws in the pool!
And tries to bite her brother with her arms, and he's completely baffled by this.
Doesn't know what's going on.
Yeah, she's like, that black like a doll's eyes, and he's just like, what the fuck?!
She's doing lines that don't bear any resemblance to...
She's not doing a scene, she's like, clearly struggling really hard to remember lines,
and so she just has the...
Like, she bites him, and then she does Hooper's line, like,
I wanna be sure, you wanna be sure, we all wanna be sure.
It's just like...
It's really, really good.
It's really good.
It's cute.
But then...
And then she confesses.
Yeah, she turns herself in, and...
Predictably, this is horrible, right?
Like, this is sort of cousin, kissing cousin, incest joke, to another scene in Alps that's
a lot like this, where you know that the violence is coming, and it has like a long lead up.
Yeah.
Where like, you see the dad sitting with the videotapes, and he tells her to go and get
the duct tape, and he like, tapes of like a VHS cassette to his hand, and then just like,
beats the shit out of her with it.
Yeah.
It's horrible.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
And we then kind of know from the next scene that this doesn't work.
Yes.
It can't.
Because she's there with the younger sister, and she says,
I want you to call me Bruce from now on.
I really, really like this.
Because obviously, they don't have names.
Like, they've been denied names for 20 plus years, and she's just like, come up on one.
And it's like, fuck it, Bruce, why not?
Yeah.
She says, whenever you call me Bruce, I'll turn around.
And they practice.
And they do like a call response, where she just like, moves to different parts of the room,
and like the younger sister goes, Bruce, and like she turns around to look at her.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So obviously having seen the movie, one of the key takeaways she's gotten from Jaws and Rocky
is the concept of a name.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's like, you say a name and somebody turns around.
Like...
You can demolish the master's house with Rocky Balboa's tools.
Yeah.
Mm.
Also, the sister doesn't quite get it, although she's got the spirit, because she's like,
she's looking at her sister's back, and she's like, oh, I want a name too.
I want to be called Back.
And the sister has to be like, you can't be called Back.
A back is a back.
You have to have a name.
Back's not a good name.
Yeah.
Think about it.
Yeah.
Good non-binary name though.
That one is called Sock.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Guess who's back.
Jesus.
Incidentally, Bruce is...
It's never spoken in the movie as far as I remember, but it's the nickname of the animatronic
shark in Jaws.
It is.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Which is just really nice.
Mm.
But so, obviously, now Christina has to get some retribution from this.
And she...
Like, the father goes to the house and...
Like, again, because he's a cheap thug and he's kind of pathetic, right?
Like, he beats the fuck out of her with her VCR.
Yeah.
And she doesn't deserve this.
She's like, okay, she's sexually exploitative and, like, you know, kind of...
There's a 50-50 on whether she's being sexually exploited herself as well here.
Yes.
Yeah.
It's very hard to untangle who the bad guy is other than the father.
Yeah, and Yoris doesn't like judging stuff, which fair enough.
Yeah, exactly.
It's a, like, kind of standoffish, non-judgmental style of filmmaking, which I like.
Yeah.
Here's some things that happened.
It happens as a natural consequence of some other things that happened.
As he's finished beating her and, like, throws the VCR on the floor, he stands in her door
and he says, I hope your kids have bad influences and develop a bad personality, which is so perfectly,
like, focus on the family, kind of.
Yeah, right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Because you've introduced this, like, malign, like, adult influence, literally in the form
of videotapes, right?
You've kind of, like, you've poisoned my children against me.
I hope your kids are, like, also bad influences, right?
Yeah.
Like, I hope no one protects your kids.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
This is the only real sense of, like, justification of what he's doing, right?
This is a kind of, like, you know, castle of purity thing.
Bad influences.
Yeah.
I'm protecting my family, right?
And I think this is one of the preoccupations of the movie is, well, what do you do?
What are you willing to do in order to protect your family?
And what are you doing to them when you do that, you know?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
I mean, it made me think a lot about a really, really useful concept I picked up from a philosopher
called Sarah Ahmed a few years ago in her book, The Cultural Politics of Emotion, where
she discusses how we describe groups like the Ku Klux Klan as, like, hate groups, right?
And they would say, and really mean it when they say, they're like, no, we don't hate
anyone.
We just, like, love white people.
Yeah.
In the same way this guy was like, no, I don't hate my kids.
I love my kids.
Look at what I'm doing for them.
Like, he experiences this as a very positive thing.
And what Sarah Ahmed points out is that what this is really describing is a narcissistic
love of the self.
It's, I love you as long as you are like me and do what I say.
Yes.
That's the kind of love that the KKK have for white people or like for any human beings.
Like, it's like, I love you as long as you're like me.
In the same way that like, you know, kids in the UK who were kicked out by their parents
because they're LGBTQ, their parents go, no, I love my kids.
It's like, no, you love them as long as they're like you.
Mm-hmm.
You don't, you love them, but you don't want them to change or be different than you.
What you really love is yourself.
Yeah.
The sort of capacity to change is a sort of like unthinkable, like, thing that has to
be prevented at all costs.
Right?
Yeah.
Absolutely.
It's a movie about being transgender, not least because you have like, uh,
her picking like a sort of male name, right?
Like, yeah.
Because you bark like a dog and you fuck your sister.
Yeah.
Speaking of.
Yeah.
Oh Christ.
Here we go.
Here we go, folks.
So now we have a problem, which is that now we don't have a Christina and somebody's got
to jack off this son.
Someone's got to fuck this son.
Someone's got to fuck him.
Yeah.
We can't let anyone else into the house.
Oh well, we've got two sisters here.
Yeah.
We'll let one of them do it.
And my note here says, eyes closed, bathtub, incest, sex audition.
Yes.
That is, yeah.
It's horrible.
It's excruciating.
Yes.
This is a, like, he picks which of his sisters he's gonna fuck, and he picks the eldest.
Yeah.
The next shot is her mum literally grooming her.
Like, she puts lipstick on her.
We have this, again, horrible, excruciating, torturous sex scene, right?
Mm-hmm.
And afterwards, the eldest daughter, Bruce, like, she lies back on
the bed, and she says to him, do that again, bitch, and I'll rip your guts out.
Which is from Rocky IV.
And I think learning boundaries from, like...
Once again, from Rocky.
From Rocky IV.
It's like, it's so good.
It's nice that we got some specificity.
Like, wasn't Rocky IV or II or III?
No, no.
It was Rocky IV specifically, and Jaws.
This is where my notes say, that's either a very good prosthetic, or she really just jacked
that guy's dick.
Yorgos, my man, you can't do that.
No, she does jack that guy's dick off.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But yeah, she threatens him in this way that neither of them really understand exactly.
Like, you and your clan, you're not gonna last in this neighbourhood.
And it's, it's like, bizarre, but it's so effective too.
Yeah.
And we also see that she's beginning to test boundaries a little bit.
Like, she, unbeknownst to her parents, goes into mum and dad's room, opens the safe and
uses the phone.
But like, she doesn't know how to dial.
So as soon as she gets like, the number you've dialed has not been recognised.
She like gets scared and puts it back.
Yeah, as you would.
She tells the youngest girl, she says, my dog tooth is loose, look, and it's not.
But it's like, she wants it to be.
I think my dog tooth is moving.
It's like, mmm, we're getting close to something here.
Getting ready to go.
I found out about the outside world and I've had a horrific experience at home.
Like, I'm ready to get out of there.
I've seen Rocky IV.
I saw the TV glow literally just now.
Yes!
Yes!
Absolutely!
Yeah!
So good.
I'm gonna talk about I saw the TV glow again in a bit.
We should probably just watch I saw the TV glow, shouldn't we?
Yeah, probably.
God, yes.
Whatever, it's your fucking bonus book next, have we?
Mmm.
The dad is like, it's your mother and I's wedding anniversary.
We will therefore decorate the house with balloons and we will have a party.
And we see the kids put on this creepy, shitty, fascist art.
Yeah.
Where they're dancing, again, as we've established, they've never seen dancing.
So it's like all fascists art.
It's disconnected from any kind of like outside influence, which has left it frenetic, meaningless,
bad, vaguely traditional.
Like the sun is there with a guitar playing a kind of Greek-ish melody.
It kind of sucks.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And the dancing that Eldest does is, or that Bruce does, in fact, is just like not even comprehensible as dancing in parts.
It's just kind of like jerking rhythmically, like moving around.
And like, it's exactly what you would do if you gave somebody the task of like undestructured, free-associative, physical improv, actually.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Which is what it is.
And because this goes on for so long, she kind of runs out of dancing.
The younger sister gets tired and goes and sits down.
Mm.
And the older sister, she does Jennifer Beale's flash dance.
She does flash dance.
Yeah.
She does the choreography from flash dance, which it's so perfect because you see the father realize that that's like an outside influence that must have happened.
Mm.
Because like, how the fuck is she actually dancing?
Yeah.
It's beautiful.
It's beautiful.
It's so, so good.
It's like indecent.
It's like scandalous.
The first time I saw this scene, I fucking wept genuinely, right?
Because I thought it was such a powerful statement about like art and life and like the sort of like human desire to connect that sort of like grows past whatever fucking tyranny you set down for.
Right.
In the form of flash dance, right?
And she like dances herself into exhaustion and then eats an entire cake.
And it's just like...
Yes!
Women rock.
Yes!
Yeah!
Let's go!
I've never seen flash dance, so I did not appreciate that's what was happening and therefore I don't think I got as much out of that scene as you did.
But now that I know that's from something else, I'm like, oh, that's really powerful.
Yeah.
It's from like a kind of like 80s dance movie.
Like it doesn't matter that it's not like meaningful.
Right.
Yeah.
Like Rocky IV, like it's another pretty bad movie realistically.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But like when it's the only one you've seen, it's the best thing ever.
Yes.
It's like update it for modern abbey audiences and she's doing the party rock shuffle and I'm like,
oh, that's the party rock shuffle!
Oh shit!
She's doing fucking TikTok dances.
Oh shit!
Spent ages learning how to do that in the CCF mess!
Damn, she's doing the Save America from Drop Dance in the alleyway.
Don't take me back to the CCF mess.
This is a film about being transgender.
Yes.
Yes.
There's a scene we've skipped which is unfortunate because it's the fulcrum of my entire argument,
which is a bit where suddenly the parents wake up in the middle of the night because
the son is screaming.
He's yelling out.
Oh yeah.
And the father goes in there and the son is like,
she, and pointing at the younger sister who's in there,
she hit me with a hammer on the leg and the sister goes, no, no, a cat did it and it just,
it ran out the window just now.
Yes.
And this is fucking perfect because this is so clearly like the reality that the father has
established where to these kids, like the lie, oh, a cat did it is so naturally like
the right thing to say that it doesn't, it passes muster for them.
But obviously we are in the position of the father where we know,
no, it fucking didn't.
A cat couldn't do that.
But because of the world he's built, he has to go like, go over to the window and close it
and go over to the son and be like, did you take your anti-cat medicines?
And like, he has to buy into the world he's created to keep it going.
And I really, really like that.
It's a fascist reproduction, right?
Exactly.
This is the younger sister who we have seen like randomly cutting people,
who is just this like little psychopath who's been like sort of like
mutilating Barbies and stuff, has like instinctually developed her way to
towards lying to tilt things in her own favor.
Yes.
But the reality she's basing off it is so wrong as to make it ridiculous.
Yeah.
I think it's nice that the film shows us that like people will push against this tyranny,
not always in the kind of wholesome, I'm going to be Rocky and I'm going to like be my own
independent person and dance way, but also in the way that like they might get more
fucked up.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just be like, well, I'm going to slice my brother up and then lie about it and say that
a cat did it.
Yeah.
This is your, I did find a way to work this in after all, this is your functionalist
history of like genocide, right?
This is, this is someone who has been raised in a sort of an environment that is so
cumulatively radicalizing that they're like seeking to like justify the things that they
want to do and seeking approval for the things that they want to do, which is sadistic by being
like, did I do a good job? Like, you know, liquidating these enemies of the people or
whatever.
Exactly.
I wanted to hit my brother in the kneecap with a hammer.
Therefore, didn't I do a good job doing the thing you're always telling us to do,
protecting us from cats?
Mm hmm.
It's like...
It's perfect.
It's really, really great.
Yeah, it's great.
I'm sorry we skipped over that.
No, no.
But it provides a counterpoint to what the older sister does, which is...
Yes.
Yes.
It's sort of also reminiscent of a scene in Titan, which is not as good of a movie,
but also a movie about being transgender.
I think it's pronounced Titanic.
I don't think they...
No, they fucked in the car on Titanic.
Draw me like one of your French cars.
Yeah.
So, it's a movie about being transgender.
Being transgender is sometimes painful and scary and gross.
Sometimes you gotta do it yourself.
Sometimes.
And to be clear, it fucking rules.
This is a great scene.
Listen, I think there's a sort of sharp divide, right?
If you watch this scene and are just horrified and you don't get it, it's not for you.
But if you're watching the scene and you do get it, it's very, very strong, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
She gets a little dumbbell and you see she takes a couple of practice swings and she
knocks out with three tries her own canine tooth.
Yeah.
And you see she's looking in the mirror, there's blood everywhere.
She is grinning.
No, she loves it.
She loves it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
This is the good shit.
This is what it's about.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Like, authenticity and liberation, like very painful experiences sometimes, but fuck are they
ever worth it, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's like, oh yeah, you're mutilating the self.
Fucking every second mutilates the self.
Mm-hmm.
Just do it.
If it's for your own good, hell fucking yes.
Yes.
Yeah, absolutely.
It's DIY, baby.
Yeah.
Just knock those teeth out.
You have to take the stuff into your own hands sometimes.
Mm-hmm.
And she leaves her tooth in the sink.
Yeah.
And she walks away from the house covered in blood.
Very conscious, I think, allusion to a lot of horror movies with the final girl.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
She's like walking away from the house covered in blood.
And hides in the boot of dad's car.
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
I've made a note here that says these parents have to be killed.
Yes.
Clearly.
And I mean that.
Yeah, no, absolutely.
Now stand by then.
Should send someone around, but...
The youngest daughter wakes the dad up, and she wakes him up by licking him.
Don't lick your dad!
Yeah, once again, stop with the lick.
Mm-hmm.
Like a dog.
Like a dog.
Do you want an animal or a friend, and the choice is fucking animal, clearly,
because they're licking.
Like a dog, yeah.
She licks his hand.
She asks dad for the harpoon gun, and at this point Anton Chekhov wakes up at the back of the
theater and goes, oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Ah!
Because dad goes, no.
There is incidentally a sort of like, maybe deeper illusion in this scene, because she
licks his hand to wake him up.
When that doesn't work, she like licks his chest.
In order to get him up, she says, I can lick your ear if you want.
And given the kind of mutability of language that we've seen, it's entirely possible,
what the fuck is an ear?
Yeah.
We don't know.
Who knows what ear is?
Maybe just fully alludes to something much more straightforwardly sexually abusive.
Yeah.
But so, we get some great acting off the dad here.
The panic, as he realizes, as he goes into the bathroom, sees the blood everywhere in the
tooth, and realizes that he's lost control.
Mm-hmm.
He knows, as well, this is a bit where he kind of like, loses his reason, right?
He knows that the kids only know that they can get out in the car.
Yeah.
And he panics and he goes out without the car.
Like, he walks outside.
He doesn't think to check the car the only way she thinks she can leave.
Mm-hmm.
Because as soon as you've like, demolished enough of this stuff, it's all gone.
And he's thinking of her like, oh, fuck, she knows what like, phones are, she like,
probably just got a fucking Uber, I don't know.
Like...
Yeah.
So he runs out down the lane, and obviously he can't find her.
In the dark, while all of the others are like, in dog position.
At the doorway of the gate.
Yeah.
Barking.
Barking.
Yeah.
Barking.
And actually, what I really like is that the youngest yells out,
Yes!
Yes!
Really good!
Really good!
Really cute!
Even by naming yourself, you have planted a seed there.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
It was also, only at this point in the movie did I realize,
we've had no non-diegetic music at all.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There is no music in this except what the characters themselves can hear.
Yeah.
Which is a really interesting choice, and I think a very powerful one too, to just be like,
there's no music in these people's world except what they're given.
There is no...
music in a film can suggest like, inner thought or emotion or like, a feeling that is not vocalized.
And the fact that the soundtrack is just sterile, is absent, just suggests so much about the inner
lives of not only the kids themselves who have been deprived of it, but also like, of the fucking parents.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
Horrific.
Fantastic.
Just incredible.
He talks to the mum, and this is again another reason why the parents must be killed.
He basically just says, ah, it's fine, we'll get the dog back, so it kind of replaces her,
right?
Yeah.
The mum seems completely broken by this.
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Doesn't have any lines, but just cries.
Yeah.
You get the sense that this whole construction lasts like, three or four more weeks.
Yeah.
It's not lasting.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Like, he manages to scold her as well, it's an interesting kind of thing, as he gets her a glass
of orange juice and she's not drinking it.
And as he's like, ah, it's fine, we'll just replace her with the dog, he's
also like, you know, if you're just gonna let that get warm, don't drink it in the first place.
Mm-hmm.
And then the next morning, with Bruce in the trunk of the car, he drives to work at the factory,
no Christina, of course, and he goes into the factory, we see the Mercedes parked outside,
and we just hold on the trunk.
And then the movie fucking ends.
That's the film, baby.
I love, I love this style of ending, right?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
The same thing I was saying about fucking Clute, right?
Where if you cut it when the phone rings, right?
Yeah.
Like...
No spoilers for Clute!
I'm gonna watch Clute tonight, I'm gonna get Clute-moded, I'm Clute-filled!
Hell yeah, text me about Clute.
Mm, Clute it up!
This is not an ambiguous ending, I submit.
Not at all.
Not at all.
It is not even slightly an ambiguous ending, because you are saying,
this character in a film has learned the techniques of film character, right?
And specifically, action hero, right?
Yeah.
Mm.
Of course she gets out of the trunk, right?
Just fucking Rocky Balboa.
She's Bruce the shark from Jaws, who came back for like three sequels, where the shark hunts
the fucking, like, Brody family to the Bahamas.
Like, she gets out of the fucking car, of course she does.
Do you believe in movies or not?
So, well, mine would say, does she get out?
Yes.
I don't know.
Do you?
Yes, also, it's also the I Saw the TV Glow ending.
Exactly!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Which is that, like, did you get out of the thing?
Did you fucking knock your own dog tooth out?
Mm.
Did you get out of the situation?
Are you willing to get out of the situation?
Yeah.
This movie, like, offers you a route to do that, you know?
Like, I don't know if I would have got it to real, like, jumping in the same river twice
thing, but I wish I had seen this when I was younger.
Like, genuinely.
Yeah.
Now I'm also remembering that Rocky's climactic speech at the end of Rocky IV is something
that's like, if I can change, and you can change, maybe we can all change.
Yeah.
In the context of, like, the Soviet Union and the USA.
Yeah.
Like, Rocky brings, spoilers for Rocky IV, Rocky ends the Cold War by winning a boxing match.
Yeah, it does.
And everyone claps.
Yeah.
This movie rules.
The movies represent a possibility of, like, growth and change, and becoming a different
person and becoming transgender and, like, not living with your shitty parents anymore.
Mm-hmm.
And, you know, I think this is why it's one of my favorite movies, you know?
Mm-hmm.
Right.
I watched this movie just before we recorded this, so, like, throughout the course of, like,
recording the podcast, I was still, like, marinating in it and, like, ruminating on it.
I didn't have a phenomenal time of watching it the first time around, but I'll tell you this for free.
Mm-hmm.
After this conversation, I will watch it again, and I will have a much better time of it.
Yeah.
I hadn't teased out a bunch of shit that you gave me halfway through this and, like, this,
this, I, I, you know what?
Five stars.
Fuck it.
Good movie.
Keep it going, baby.
It's real good.
It's real good.
Excited to watch more of his shit.
This was my first Yorgos movie.
Yeah.
One to watch.
Keep an eye.
Yorgos.
I'll put you on to this guy.
Yorgos Lanthimos.
I hear he's pretty good.
This isn't just a recommendation.
This is an order.
Go and watch Dogtooth.
Run, do not walk.
Yeah.
I would love for us to watch some more Yorgos Lanthimos movies.
I would love for us to watch Alps, which is in many ways kind of Dogtooth 2.
Ooh.
And, uh, yeah.
Dogtooth.
It's my pick next on a bonus episode.
And, like, I saw the TV Globe would make an excellent compound into this.
I was also weighing up making you watch something incredibly dumb that has nothing to do with
anything.
I'll do that for my one, maybe.
Maybe we should watch I Saw the TV Globe next, although I'm, like, afraid to return to it.
I'm afraid to watch it for much the same reason, you know?
Like, Dogtooth ambushed me, and if I'd known it was going to go this hard and have this effect
on me, I don't know if I would have had it in.
This is the thing.
Like, Dogtooth advocates for an unexpected movie like Rocky IV.
And, yeah.
No, absolutely.
I want to watch this.
I think you can build I Saw the TV Globe up in your head a little too much sometimes,
like, as well.
Possibly.
I think go into it without any real expectations, I think.
Also, by the way, as part of the, like, visual language of this movie and what it's saying
about, like, you know, as an allegory for fascism, as an allegory for, like, suburbia, for the
family, any of this stuff.
I think it has a lot in common with two other films which you may be interested in.
Funny Games by Michael Harnica and The Zone of Interest.
Zone of Interest I watched recently.
Well, it's a good movie.
It's certainly not an exciting or happy movie to watch, but it's something that's unbelievably
useful and good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
In that case, let's do I Saw the TV Globe next.
Let's fucking do it.
If only because, like, it would be nice to have a, to actually watch a film that actually
is about being transgender.
Like, not even as a joke on a big, that is literally textually what the film is about.
And I'll save Bulletproof Monk for another time.
Hell yeah.
Hell yeah.
I know!
I know, right?
Given that when I saw the other big transgender movie that's out at the moment, The People's
Joker, and I, like, dissociated for two days, I'm going to watch I Saw the TV Globe with
my wife so that she can hug me if I get scared or sad.
That's a good idea.
I'm going to have to watch it again.
We'll be back to record that soon.
The next mainline episodes...
It's Johnny English 3 will be the next one coming out.
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.
And there will be video of that as well coming out so you can see the fit, which was exquisite.
I'm going to take my microphone with me to LA, because I'm going to the premiere of
Dracula's Ex-Girlfriend, and also to the Emmys.
So, yeah.
That's crazy, dog.
The next episode will be California, Abby, once again.
I know.
Nuts.
All right.
Fantastic.
This has been a real pleasure.
Yes.
As always.
Thank you so much for subscribing, and we will see you next time.
Bye, everyone.
Thank you for listening to this curtain.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, everyone.
Thank you for listening to yet another episode of Kill James Bond.
Next week on the free feed.
It's the third Johnny English live show, which means, of course, that the video for that will
also be available on our YouTube.
That's just Kill James Bond.
And in two weeks' time, the next bonus episode will be I Saw the TV Glow.
We'll check that thing out.
See if maybe it has something to say about being transgender.
Who knows?
It might.
If you're hearing this, that makes you a Patreon of the show.
