Listeners, do you remember a podcast that you used to listen to about James Bond movies?
And it had three people, November, Devin and Abby.
Do you ever feel like episodes of Kill James Bond were more real than real life?
Did you ever feel like we were your real friends, even more than your actual ones?
What if you were on that podcast and you're remembering it as a podcast, but it was all real?
That's where we've been, listeners.
We've been in the podcast.
We've been in Kill James Bond.
The Bond opaque.
Fuck.
You don't remember watching all 25 James Bond films with us together?
You were there.
You were there.
It was real.
And it was real and it was strong.
You need to wake up.
You're dying.
We could have talked about James Bond together, Alan.
Oh no, God.
Enough of this.
I'm hitting the theme song.
Oh no.
You know it's capturing the energy when I have to open it with enough of this.
Cease your prattling.
Silence, fools.
Yeah, I'm actually, I'm usually hitting you with like a silence, fools, right before we
start recording.
But like sometimes it creeps into the thing, you know.
I gotta get my daily vizier affirmations in, you know.
Yeah, normally we cut it off from the start of the recording, but we all do do our vizier
affirmations.
Just like getting in a one-on-one call with either Abby or Dev, depending on the week and
being like, they're plotting against you, Sire.
The other one is fucking plotting.
They don't have your best interests at heart, my liege.
Hello and welcome.
Saruman the White has ever been our ally.
Hello and welcome to a bonus episode of Kill James Bond.
It is, as always, your real life friends, November, Abby, and Dev.
And we watched I Saw the TV Glow, which you may recall.
It's done a lot of press.
It's like the, or like one of the big trans films of the last couple of years.
It's a cinematic transgender tipping point is occurring.
And we're getting a lot of art about being trans, which is something that like, you know,
is great.
I'm in support of it.
Yeah, absolutely.
I'm part of it.
I mean, yeah, we kind of all are, actually, which is a strange thing to think about.
Oh shit.
Oh god, the podcast might not be real for you guys listening, but it's real for me.
It is real for us.
I'm in this shit.
I'm live right now.
I'm recording.
I'm in this shit and I can't get out.
I'm she, her.
I've always been she, her.
Dracula's ex-girlfriend Flo, is that anything?
They must have amnesia.
They forgot I'm they, them.
But yes, as this is, as you may get the sense, even if you haven't seen the film,
this is a movie about transition and about the kind of like mutability of memory and about
parasociality and about kind of finding your identity through, in this case, TV, but art
more generally, right?
It's about, it's like a specific kind of trans experience, which may not be your experience
It was not mine.
If you are trans.
I will lay my cards on the table.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And the important thing, the important thing to remember is that if this film doesn't reflect
your experience and you're not this particular kind of trans person, you're a freak and there's
something wrong with you.
You're AGP.
As someone who is a freak and is AGP and there is something wrong with me.
No, it's you who is the one who is AGP.
I'm kidding.
As the wrong kind of trans woman, right?
Like, who did not relate to this movie in that way, right?
Not relating to this movie doesn't make it a bad film.
It's a bad film for other reasons.
I don't really think...
It's an episode of Kill James Bond.
There's going to be some conflict, listeners, because November is a V-pin and this is a bad film
and I am of the correct opinion that it's good.
I'm not really of the opinion that it's a bad film.
It's not a film that I connected with.
It's...
Fair.
Technically, it is well done.
I think there are some things that I would change about it were I making it, but then
that's the thing.
It's a very individual experience, right?
And I have a broader philosophical beef that is not really with the movie, but is kind
of like a call to action.
There will be a call to action in this episode about this kind of wave of trans art, right?
I think the review in...
I think it was The Times said much the same thing.
I actually was like, this is really well made.
I hated it.
Yeah.
I mean, I don't know why they hired me to write for them.
They're a very trans-loving newspaper, but...
I enjoyed it.
Obviously, I'm not trans-feminine or indeed really trans-masculine.
I'm just sort of...
I'm just sort of trans.
You're trans-devinant.
Indeed, I became Devon at a certain point.
And this...
I do relate to this movie a lot as well.
Like, this one really...
It did get me.
It got me right in the heart.
I cried twice the first time I watched it.
Only once the second time.
Progress.
I watched it in a room full of trans people in a cinema.
And it was a wonderful evening.
It was a transcendent experience.
But anyway, we open on the A24 logo, which is a sure shine that you're in for some freaky
shit.
Less so these days.
Less so.
Yeah.
Look, A24 made good movies.
I happen to believe they make great movies.
They do.
They also made X-Men, Civil War.
Yeah.
X-Men, Civil War.
Great movies!
Every time I say Civil War, I tag on a new thing on the front of it.
Like, you know, Disney's Civil War, Marvel's Civil War, X-Men versus Ballistic X-Version
Civil War, Capcom.
I happen to love the entire franchise.
It's all really good.
Anyway.
A24 logo.
And then we meet our protagonist.
Yeah.
We open on this suburban road at night.
There are the purple chalk outlines, drawings all over the road.
And there's this ice cream truck in the distance with its lights on.
Someone has been fucking vandalizing the album cover for American football is what's been
happening.
Also, I am going to need you two to do the bulk of the heavy lifting on recounting what
happens in this movie because I was too annoyed to do that.
Okay.
That's fine.
Our first thing that happens is that we meet our protagonist, Owen, who is a young black
boy?
Mm-hmm.
Question mark?
There will be some shenanigans over this question later.
Ostensibly so.
Yes.
Who's watching TV and sees an advert for this TV show called The Pink Opaque.
Mm-hmm.
The lead of which is a beautiful black girl named Isabel, who kind of looks a little bit
like him.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's the shot of her walking across a football field.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
And then we cut to him in class and they're doing an activity, which I'm not sure if like,
did other people do this?
Because we did this in school.
Mm-hmm.
Where they bring in a parachute and you just kind of like lift it up and you sit under the
parachute for a bit?
Hell yeah, we did this shit.
We didn't do this shit.
No.
We did this shit and I don't know why.
I got the big parachute, yeah.
I...
You go, whoof.
And that's about it.
My experience in school was mostly just like you do the plot of The Lord of the Flies to
each other for like, I don't know, 10 years or whatever.
Oh no, we did that too.
Well, you can do that on or about the parachute.
Yeah.
Like, don't worry.
You close that parachute down, it's only kids under there.
The teachers aren't in there.
Lord of the Flies occurs.
Yeah.
Anyway, the parachute, listeners, because this movie is not a subtle one, the parachute
is literally in the trans flag colors.
Yes.
Just in case any of you were just like, gee, I don't get it.
Like, what's the movie about?
It's like, here is what the movie is about.
We're setting this out early.
The movie is like, very deliberately unsubtle.
Yes.
You know, like, to be clear, right, when I, if I talk about it being unsubtle later in
a negative way, it's not a criticism that this is done because it was like, lacking skill
or because it wasn't intentional.
It's an intentional choice that the movie is making that I don't like.
But that's fine, you know?
And then we cut forward a little bit and we meet Owen when he's a little bit older.
We're going to spend much of the first half of the film jumping about in time between
young Owen and then our lead actor, Justice Smith, who narrates to us and tells us that
the other night he couldn't sleep.
So he started rewatching his favorite show, The Pink Opaque.
Justice Smith's voice in this, I mean, the whole performance is fucking incredible.
But his voice in particular is so fucking good.
Politely, he sounds like, and this is an incredible act to carry off for the whole movie,
the biggest pussy in the world, right?
It's so good.
His voice is like constantly cracking.
He sounds like he's nervous about everything he's saying.
It's perfect.
You know the teenager in The Simpsons, the, you know, the, my God, you're greasy kid.
Oh, the squeaky voice teen.
Yeah, yeah.
It's quite squeaky voice teen.
It is.
It's also androgynous.
It sounds, I don't know, like, I don't know what kind of voice training he did to achieve
this, but it is phenomenal.
It is androgynous.
Anyway, we go to his high school on election night.
Void High.
Void High School, which is a very like night veil detail.
Up to you whether that's a compliment or not.
I do, I do.
I did notice.
Yeah.
I'll go on you first.
The big VHS signs everywhere.
Again, just like kicking your absolute dick in with the like, you know, symbolism.
It's a movie about symbolism.
Yeah.
What I, what I do love about the, the Void High School is for there's a little sign somewhere
that says Go Vultures, which leads me to believe that their football team is called
the Void Vultures, which fucking goes.
That's great.
Listen, I'm not, I'm a big merch person because I'm a terrible hipster and hypocrite about,
about like films.
I would absolutely wear a Void Vultures jersey.
Yeah, so would I, my eyes are just fucking lighting up.
Oh, I need to get a Void Vultures shirt.
That'd be so fun.
Yeah.
The Void Vultures, like, football jersey, 100% I would wear this.
Oh, I've got to get one of those.
Okay, great.
Fine.
Oh, Void Vultures cheerleader outfit?
Yes.
Jane, if you haven't done that yet, it comes in.
I'm sorry I said I didn't like your movie.
I still don't, but I would wear the cheerleader outfit.
Yeah.
VHS.
Clever, you know.
Yes.
It stands for Video Home System.
It's election night, 1980...
It's 19...
No, it's 1996.
Yeah, because she...
I think it's Bill Clinton.
It is Clinton, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's 1879.
Bill Clinton is president.
Oceans are now battlefields.
Yeah.
And it's exploring, again, and it tells you this later on.
This is a recurring theme.
Someone will be along to tell you about the theme you just saw.
That, like, a high school on election night is a liminal space.
It's, like, out of its usual thing.
It's weird.
It's disjointed.
None of the stuff it's meant to be used for is there.
All the lights are off.
All the tables are, like, upturned.
It's weird and alienated.
It's a polling station.
It's with his mum, and they vote.
What if the thing could be something else?
What if the Pizza Hut wasn't a Pizza Hut anymore, you know?
Yeah.
Well, in fact, so he wanders the hall, and he meets Maddie.
And I also, again, this performance by Bridget Lindy Payne.
Phenomenal.
Beautiful.
Fantastic.
Yeah, because, like, Justice Smith isn't playing young Owen here.
It's a kid called Ian Foreman who's doing a great job of it.
Bridget is playing young Maddie.
Like, she plays herself the whole way through the movie,
and she embodies this awkward child so well.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's great about, like, age difference between kids as well.
Like, she's, like, a ninth grader and Owen's a seventh grader.
And he's, like, a seventh grader, and she's, like, you're a baby.
Yeah.
But she's reading an episode guide to the Pink Opaque,
like, one of these, like, fan companion things.
One of the little annuals, yeah.
This book, which is bright pink, and, again, there's this recurring thing of, like,
there is this pop of color in this scene when they sit down and talk to each other.
There's also, like, a very pink vending machine that's lit up.
Literally says, like, Fruitopia on it.
Yeah, yeah.
And on the other side of the shot is, like, a totally dark, like, normal style, like,
cishet vending machine.
To be like, you know, what kind of vending machine are you trying to be in this high school
cafeteria of life, you know?
But they get chatting about this, like, slightly awkwardly.
The pacing of the dialogue in this film, particularly in the first half,
is so slow and pained.
The shots hold on the characters for so long.
The pauses between the dialogue are so long.
It's deliberately making you very uncomfortable.
It's very well acted.
For Fremdung's effect, again, it's our best friend, you know?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
If you've ever, if you've seen Sean Obama's previous work,
we're all going to the World's Fair, this is very familiar.
Like, that movie, similar kind of themes, less evolved filmmaking, I'd say.
Really, really plays into, like, long shots.
Really, like, lets you hold with them.
Lets you feel the, like, isolation and loneliness that these kids are feeling
in, like, suburban America.
Really good.
But she, which is to say, Maddie, the character's pronouns are she, her,
Bridget, Lily Payne's pronouns are they, them, as far as I know.
But she, Maddie...
Oh, are they?
Sorry.
...asks, hey, have you seen the show?
Because Owen comments on it.
And he goes, oh, no, it's on at 10.30, my bedtime's 10pm.
She calls him a baby, and this kind of hurts his feelings.
And then to make up for it, she's like,
election night's kind of cool, isn't it?
It's like the school is transformed into something else.
Interesting.
Crazy, what a concept, wow!
What about Walken at the end there, you know?
Wow, wow!
It's crazy, transgender, they took my penis and inverted it.
Carried that hunk of metal up my ass for 20 minutes.
It was great.
Anyway.
Walken at the end.
Yeah, she lets him read a bit of the annual.
And it's like, you know, most kids don't like it.
It's probably too old for you.
The lore's super deep and advanced.
Yeah.
So cute.
It's 100% a way that kids and adults do, I guess, engage with TV.
And one of the preoccupations of this movie is Buffy, right?
And this is 100%, like a trillion percent,
a teenage conversation about Buffy.
It's actually super smart.
Most people don't get the letters.
Yeah, like, isn't that for kids?
No.
You actually have to have a very high IQ to appreciate Buffy.
Exactly, exactly.
When she's handing this little, like, pamphlet over,
she talks about what's in every episode as well.
She goes, like, it's full of, like, breakdowns of all the episodes.
It's got, like, quotes and things.
And it's got, like, the double bill of bands
that play each week at the double lunch.
And I wrote that point down.
Yeah, just write Twin Peaks again.
Or alternatively, if you want to, like,
kick another Night Vale thing at this, you know.
But yeah, it's got, like, a musical interlude, you know.
Yeah.
Twin Peaks, by the way, the other kind of, like, TV obsession of this.
And also something that adults are like,
yeah, you know, most people don't really get it
because, like, it's got a lot of, like, lore and stuff
and people don't pick up on all the levels of it.
So, again, we've got this thing of, like, progression of, like,
being a fan, right?
And what that means.
This is the part at which I start to feel slightly like a freak AGP,
wrong kind of trans person.
Because I've never seen Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
I've never seen Twin Peaks.
Me neither.
Neither.
Yeah.
Never in my life.
We are so equipped to review this movie because neither have I.
Wow, that's crazy.
Wow.
If we, yeah, all right, well,
the comments will be full of all the illusions we've missed.
I mean, I was a fan, it will be,
but I was a fan when I was a kid of Star Wars.
I had, like, annuals and books about Star Wars.
Which is crazy because now I'm in it.
I did have the Star Wars annual.
I wasn't really, like, a TV person.
Like, I didn't really, like, The Simpsons was the closest, I guess.
Yeah, Tenshi Muyo.
You're not getting, like, a kind of an AGP thing out of, like,
man, I really feel more like a Lisa than a Bart, you know, even if you do.
I did.
Yeah, I mean, don't we all, like...
My pink opaque for a while was, like,
fucking My Little Pony Friendship is Magic,
which very much did have the same sort of transgen beam effect
on half the audience.
You're right.
Okay, yeah, that's a fair point.
Yeah, fair.
Sure, sure.
Absolutely.
Anyway, Maddie suggests some kind of plan to Owen,
and on the way home, Owen asks his mom,
hey, could I have a sleepover at my friend Johnny's at the weekend?
Maybe.
We'll have to ask your father,
who is a largely unseen presence through most of the movie.
Yes, that's right.
And this is one of the times where the movie is, like,
and again, just reinforcing that all the stuff that is not subtle
is deliberately so,
because the movie does know how to show and not tell,
as it does here,
where it's like,
oh, you'll have to ask your father,
of whom Owen is obviously terrified,
because he asks his mom to ask for him.
But also, when they get in the door,
you see her, like, kind of, like,
stop and check herself at the door,
you know, in a way that is, like,
eloquently, like,
she is also terrified of this fucking guy.
Yeah, you feel the energy drop when she says,
you'll have to ask your father.
And he's always soundtracked by,
if you like, kind of, like, mass culture, right,
in the form of TV that is always blaring,
like, studio laughter,
you know, like, sitcom laughter.
In fact, I even have a drop,
not from this specifically,
but of, like,
type of thing, you know.
And it's, like, constant.
Like, it's not in response to any jokes,
it doesn't have the rhythm of it,
that's part of what makes Alien.
It's this constant, like,
rolling kind of laughter.
And, yeah,
it's sort of, like,
this is something that you cannot really feel connected to,
and it's something that is kind of quite threatening,
particularly as a, like,
a young person,
is this idea of being laughed at,
you know, being an object of laughter.
Did you spot who plays the dad?
Yeah, baby.
That's Fred fucking Durst right there.
That's Fred Durst from Limp Bizkit.
Yeah, that's Fred Durst from Fred Durst.
Not entirely sure how he ended up in this film.
Yeah, he's constantly soundtracked by a very quiet
roller, roller, roller, roller,
the whole time he's on screen.
He did the soundtrack from Mission Impossible 2.
Jesus, really.
He's having fun.
He does a fucking great job.
The Limp Bizkit credits music from Mission Impossible 2
fucking bangs.
It's on my gym playlist.
It's great.
My gym playlist's been getting gayer as time goes on.
I'm getting, like, Sophie Hunter on it.
I'm definitely getting cuntier.
Yeah, it's more Slater,
more Kim Petrus on there now,
plus Dragon Ball Z.
More Kim Petrus.
How's that?
I did the, like,
the highest stroke rate on the rowing machine of my life
to Sophie Hunter's song called Cunt.
Oh, I fucking love Cunt.
That came on, like,
on, like, Smart Shuffle.
I had no idea what the fuck it was,
and I was, like, locked in unexpectedly.
I go to Bodega for breakfast.
Oh, my God.
Maybe.
That is my fucking permanent soundtrack.
Yeah, yeah.
And meanwhile, I'm, like, hitting, like,
like, 40-something, like, strokes per minute
and throwing both my shoulders out,
and I'm just like, Jesus Christ.
Embarrassed to say that when I'm on the rowing machine,
I listen to the Hasbin Hotel soundtrack.
That's very funny.
This is the thing.
You're allowed to, well,
we'll get to this.
You're allowed.
Anyway, the shot while Owen is, like,
waiting to hear if he's allowed to sleep over
is so good as well,
because, like, it's this dark house.
He's at the top of the stairs
in, like, the bottom corner of the frame,
and he feels so small and so vulnerable.
You don't even hear the dad yet.
You only hear his mom asking him.
Yeah, yeah.
The shots throughout the whole film
are fucking amazing.
The cinematographer on this was Eric Yu,
who hasn't done a whole lot of stuff before,
but, I mean, like,
knocks it out of the fucking pot.
Adding him to a list of people
I would love to work with.
Yeah, it's like it's a well-shot film.
No argument there.
So, yeah, he is able to go on this sleepover,
ostensibly, that he has asked for.
And he takes his big pink sleeping bag.
Huge pink sleeping bag.
By the way, he's also often wearing, like,
a kind of subdued pink, like, sweater
for a lot of these.
It wears pink a lot.
Yeah, interesting.
Curious.
What could this signify?
He sneaks away to Maddie's house.
He pretends to go to his friend's house
and then, like, sneaks away to Maddie's,
where her and her friend Amanda
are hanging out on the couch
talking about boys
and how they don't like boys.
Again, not subtle.
No, classic.
And they watch the Pinker Pig together.
And we just see at this point
what the show is about.
It's about these two girls,
Isabel and Tara,
who have a psychic connection
and they fight monsters every week, right?
Yeah.
And then we see one pretty cheesy episode
where they fight an evil ice cream man monster.
It's a sort of crucial aspect of this
that the show is not good
from what we see a bit.
It doesn't need to be, right?
Also, I love the set design
of this basement
because it perfectly nails...
Like, Maddie is kind of like,
not to sort of spoil the gender here,
like, a kind of a hot couch guy, right?
Yeah.
Because, like,
you've got the aforementioned hot couch.
You have...
I think this is a beautiful piece of set dressing.
And not least because it's casting, like,
giant blue light everywhere.
Being like,
this is a dude.
The nastiest aquarium
in the fucking world.
It's...
Like, you want to talk about opaque,
like, no fish could survive this.
But you have a kind of, like,
grimy blue light everywhere.
And, yeah, it's like,
we're making some statements here.
And we also learn that the big villain,
the big bad of the show,
is this character called Mr. Melancholy,
who is the man in the moon,
the fucked up Majora's Mask moon,
but, like, done real bad,
who wants to trap Isabel and Tara
in the Midnight Realm.
That's his evil plan.
You ever seen the Georges Melet film
Voyage to the Moon?
You know, it's that guy's dysphoria,
you know?
Yeah.
The moon from the Mighty Boosh.
Make the moon fucked up.
It's good.
It's...
Yeah.
One stop shop, baby.
I'm just trying to envision in my head
the trans person whose show
was the Mighty Boosh.
And I...
That's...
There are definitely some trans men
I know that, like,
enjoyed Noel Fielding's output.
That is a fucking energy.
Yeah.
Interesting.
Sound off in the comments.
I saw the black face.
No.
Sometimes the Mighty Boosh
feels more real than real life.
Really?
Does it?
Do you ever look back
and think it seems more real
than real life
and it's like,
it was up inside ya.
Do you remember when you did black face?
That was you.
You were eating that soup.
You sang a little song about it.
Listener,
you had a third season
that didn't really go anywhere
and shouldn't have happened.
Listener,
you used to date
Peaches Geldof when she was 16.
Ooh.
You've got speeding tickets.
In the actual show,
in the Pinko Pig show as well,
the road is also,
like,
they're sat like a suburban fucking road
and the road also has the same graffiti on it.
Yeah.
Again,
not subtle.
You see the graffiti for like a third time
when he's going over to the house
for the first time.
And I should,
I'm going to call Owen by he, him
the entire way through this.
It's kind of the point of the movie,
I would say.
Yeah.
Like,
He remains he, him the whole fucking way.
Yeah,
absolutely does,
despite the screaming obviousness otherwise.
You know,
and then this is a good reason
to have the screaming obviousness,
right?
Yes,
absolutely.
And Maddie says,
sometimes the Pinko Pig
feels more real than real life,
you know?
And then Owen's like,
huh,
yeah.
And then in the morning,
goes home kind of full of inexplicable yearning
and just thinking a lot about the show.
Yeah,
imagining Isabel walking around the woods
and like breathing like,
ah,
you know,
which is very,
because he's got a fucking,
like,
asthma.
He's got an inhaler.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Yeah,
that's nice actually.
And anyway,
we cut forward two years.
We smash cut forward
and first of all,
he's not wearing the pink anymore.
He's wearing,
like,
a gray sweatshirt
and carrying a big blue thing
of candy floss.
Yeah.
Beautiful physical acting here
and it makes it look like
it weighs about a billion pounds,
you know?
Yeah.
God.
This is the first
that it's Justice Smith
and not the...
Yeah.
Justice Smith fucking knocks it
out of the box.
And you get another
very similar shot to earlier
where he's like,
tiny and in the bottom
corner of the frame
because he's there
with his mother
at the funfair
and his mother
has just had,
like,
a cancer scare
and is not doing well.
Yeah.
He's not doing too great.
She knows that something
is, like,
up with him
but she doesn't know what
and it's something that,
like,
neither of them
can really articulate
which is,
I think,
something that's going to feel
very familiar
for a lot of trans people,
right?
Is even when your parents,
if they do try
and have a relationship
with you like that,
it's something that is,
like,
you know,
inexpressively,
strange and difficult.
Blocked.
Yeah.
The other thing about this,
we're, like,
hammering in another
sort of, like,
tent peg of a theme here,
right,
which is regression
of age
and, like,
stagnation,
right?
Like,
a kind of failure
to thrive,
a failure to grow,
right?
Because Owen is a teenager
and you get the kind of thing
of, like,
isn't he a little old
to be,
to have, like,
candy floss
at a funfair
or to,
you know,
have a bedtime.
Yes.
Yeah,
bedtime.
Yeah,
he's in ninth grade.
He's as old as Maddie was
when we first saw her.
Yes,
and I'm just going to double check
what age that is.
Yeah,
how old is ninth grade?
Ninth grade is 14 to 15.
Oh, okay.
It says here.
All right,
perfect.
British,
wouldn't know.
I had a bedtime
when I was 14.
I don't recall.
So anyway,
he says again,
can I stay up
and watch the Pinker Peake
again
and his dad,
Fred Durst,
has this fucking
devastating line
where he just sort of
stays silent
for about a minute
and then just,
like,
half turns around
in the car
and goes,
isn't that a show
for girls?
And then the conversation
is over.
Yeah,
it's not obviously
scornful because
it doesn't need to be,
right?
Like,
it's just like,
this is something
that is,
like,
quietly,
like,
unacceptable,
you know?
It's good.
Fred Durst,
good actor,
apparently,
which was a surprise.
So,
Owen speaks directly
to us again,
looks down the camera
and talks to us
and says that
he wasn't allowed
to watch the show
but Maddie
taped every single
episode for him.
Yeah,
and you hit a bunch
of,
like,
high school movies
because you see
as he's,
like,
walking the halls
of this high school
the,
like,
handwritten labels
that she has done
for,
with,
like,
little bits of commentary
and,
like,
drawn,
like,
stars and other
doodles around them
for each episode
and a bit of themes
that I really,
really like,
right,
because it's,
it's an interesting
point to make
about transition
is every single
surface of,
like,
every hall
in this,
sort of,
like,
labyrinthine high school
that he's walking
through
is covered in,
like,
a motivational slogan
of the form
that you would find
in a high school,
right,
like,
yes,
broadly of two genres,
right,
like,
there's,
be true to yourself
or turn on self,
be true to yourself,
be true is,
like,
the first one.
Actually,
I have them in order.
Carpe diem is the first one.
Mm-hmm.
Then to thine own self
be true.
Mm-hmm.
Then winners never quit.
Mm-hmm.
And also,
they get more,
like,
militaristic as you go on.
Yeah.
They have a duty,
honor country,
which is the motto
of West Point,
I believe.
They even have
the only easy day
was yesterday,
which is some Navy SEAL
motivational bullshit.
Mm-hmm.
Pain is weakness
leaving the body.
Mm-hmm.
And I think...
Holds on that.
Yeah.
It is, like,
very, very interesting to me
to frame that as, like,
it's kind of what transition is,
right?
As you can...
It's a truer implementation
of all of this
motivational bullshit
than the stuff
that anyone expects you
to do with it.
Like, you know...
Yeah.
Pain is weakness
leaving the body
has more applicability,
albeit maybe in a toxic way,
to transitioning
than it does to, like,
I don't know,
football.
You know?
Yeah.
Exactly.
Yeah.
Yeah, the cellulitis.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
I've had so much weakness
leave my body.
Mm-hmm.
Or you could read it
as he is continuing
his journey
through high school,
both in space
and also in time,
this repression
is being drilled
into him more and more.
Like, the need to repress
is being, like,
he's being indoctrinated
into it.
Another part
that I pulled on this
is that's the only
display boards.
Like, there are no things
there, like,
putting up students' work.
There's no, like,
achievements being celebrated.
It's purely, like,
solid backdrops
with things like
courage written on them.
You know?
Like, it goes towards
this sort of sense
that, like,
this world is less
well thought out.
Let me, like,
complicate this for you
and put my finger
on the scale here a bit
because I think
it's a plausible reading
of it,
but I think my,
the thing that militates
against it for me
is that we see
when he's at the polling station
as a sort of, like,
younger kid
with his mom
that they're raising funds
for the Void High Jazz Band,
right?
It has a jazz band.
This is not, like,
it is a spiritually
impoverished place
in that sense,
but I think it's more
the case of, like,
a recurring thing
with Owen of him
refusing to see,
right?
Like,
being surrounded
by stuff
that he is, like,
absolutely refusing
to internalize,
right?
Okay.
And all of this stuff,
like,
to thine own self
be true,
he is refusing
to see it
or apply it to himself.
He's walking around
with his head down.
Not because,
you know,
it's suggesting
be true to thine own self
by, you know,
being a football player
or whatever.
It's suggesting
be true to thine own self
and he's like,
I don't want to
because I'm scared.
I don't know how to do that.
Another thing this sequence
sells really well
is, like,
that sense of
walking around school
because you have to be there
but all you are doing
is thinking about,
like,
the media that you're consuming
or, like,
what you want to do
when you're out of there.
It's,
like,
the soundtrack as well,
like,
the soundtrack only really comes in
when you want,
when it wants you to hear
the fucking songs.
When they've not got,
like,
a pop song blasting,
it's basically silent.
This is one of those times
where they've got,
like,
a song blasting
and it's supposed to be like,
No,
it's Starburned and Unkissed
by Caroline Palachuk
and it's fucking good.
It's intended to be,
like,
a high school movie.
It's like fucking
Sixteen Candles
or whatever,
you know,
to be...
Exactly.
Yeah.
Johnny Darko did this too.
Fucking Clueless.
Very similar sequence.
Yeah.
Also,
Owen becomes obsessed
with the show.
He watches every episode
on VHS.
Yes.
He says the lines,
specifically,
he says Isabelle's lines
along with the show
and he hides this
from his parents.
She's just like me.
Yeah.
Yeah,
she is, pal.
For real.
I'm just like
Blobo from my shows.
Like,
Whoa.
Hmm.
I saw the TV
Blobo.
We'll get there.
I'm listening to old KJBs
and saying the words.
It's like,
I see myself
in this character.
I do.
Yeah.
I see myself
in the character
of November Kelly
from Kill James Bond.
They have,
this is one of my favorite scenes.
They have a conversation
on the bleachers.
Oh.
Which is very,
very awkward.
There's a nice detail
at the start of it,
which is,
Owen asks,
Maddie,
are you and Amanda
still friends?
And Maddie says,
no.
Amanda like threw her
under the bus
a year ago
with a false
sexual assault allegation
in order to gain popularity.
She's like,
she told the whole school
I touched her tit,
which isn't true.
And then now she's
on the cheerleader squad.
Like,
implication being that like,
she had to sacrifice
her friendship
with the trans girl
in order to fucking like,
Yeah.
You know,
get in with the popular kids.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
Nice.
We get this thing
which establishes
the,
and again,
a very familiar
trans experience
for a lot of people
of,
on both sides,
really.
You have this,
you have this situation
where Maddie is like,
you realize that
we're not like,
dating here.
This isn't romantic
because as she says,
and you can see this
rip the heart out of Owen,
I like girls.
I'm not into boys.
And she asks him,
like,
you know,
are you into boys?
Are you into girls?
And he sort of stumbles
for the nearest thing
which is,
I think that I like TV shows.
Yeah.
I haven't ever really
thought about it.
If I start thinking about it,
I feel sick to my stomach.
You know,
he gives this whole great speech
where he's like,
I feel like there's,
there's just nothing inside me.
And I'm still too nervous
to open myself up
and check.
It's beautiful.
And he says,
at the end of this speech,
he's like,
I feel like somebody
dug out all my insides
with a shovel, right?
He says to her,
do you ever feel like that?
And the fucking look
that she gives him
is so,
it's so incredible.
Yeah.
And then she says,
maybe you're like Isabel
in the show.
You're afraid
of what's inside you.
Yeah.
This scene is so good
and so well-liked.
And I like,
really funny as well.
It's,
I love this scene.
It's my favorite one.
Yeah.
That's heartbreaking.
Yeah.
In a great way though.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So they watch the show together.
It's just good seeing him
open up to her
because he like,
doesn't do it to his parents.
He certainly doesn't do it
to his mom
who is like,
not shown to be
a negative influence
on his life.
No,
she's just like,
not able to help him.
Yeah.
She's sort of like
a well-meaning
but ineffectual.
And then she dies,
to be fair.
That's not entirely her fault.
Yeah.
Like literally,
the feminine presence
in his life
is dying.
It's less than the like,
dead wife in John Wick gets,
you know,
it's just like,
Yeah.
And fine,
show,
don't tell,
whatever.
Yeah.
So they watch the show together
and then afterwards,
Maddie says,
I'm gonna leave town soon.
There's been an allusion
earlier on
to her stepfather
being violent.
Yeah,
they watch the show
and Maddie breaks down
while watching it
and like,
and no one doesn't say shit.
Like,
just,
yeah.
Yeah.
She says,
I'll die if I stay here.
And he says,
if you go,
I won't have anyone
to watch the show
with.
In the most giant
pussy in the world
voice as well,
by the way.
Yes,
yes.
It's like,
again,
it's infantile,
right?
Like,
because again,
we have this thing
of regression
and stagnation.
He's still doing
the like,
sleepover thing
in order to go
and see the show
with her.
He's still got the like,
pink sleeping bag even.
Yeah.
He's like 15 going on 16 here
and he's still doing
the like,
sleepover thing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then we get this scene
where,
so Isabel and Tara
in the show
have like a tattoo
on the backs of their necks,
a pink tattoo.
It's like a ghost
with glasses.
It's a cute little doodle.
And we get this scene
where Maddie draws
the tattoo
on the back
of Owen's neck.
And it is,
this is shot
like a sex scene.
It's very intimate.
Yes.
Yes.
It's extremely intimate.
Even the way that,
that she like strokes
his shoulder a little bit
as she's like preparing
the pen
and like she draws it on
and like peels
his shirt back.
It's,
it's shot like a sex scene.
It's,
it's beautiful.
Um,
and then she sleeps
next to him.
A shot like a sex scene
but crucially isn't
is the thing.
It's like,
it's not erotic.
It's not really sexualized.
It's,
it's sensual
and it's intimate
but it's like,
um,
yeah.
Um,
it's a sort of
moment of emotional
connection
that they're having
because the,
like,
even sexuality
is something completely
like alien here,
you know?
Well,
I would say it is erotic
in the Susan Sontag sense
of conveying palpability.
It's,
uh,
makers when they have to put
unnecessary tattooing scenes
in,
um,
um,
yeah.
Um,
anyway,
so she sleeps next to him
and then he
hallucinates,
question mark,
uh,
lights and TV static
appearing over his head.
So we get the kind of,
there is some weird shit happening.
They do the A24 thing
where they hit you
with an electric noise
like,
which,
uh,
A24 movies
love doing.
I would hate to be hit
with an electric noise.
Yeah.
And then smash cut to him
violently scrubbing
the tattoo off.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Of course,
because,
like,
we,
we,
like,
make our own,
like,
prisons,
uh,
which is a,
like,
recurring thing.
He,
like,
he turns himself in,
right?
Yeah.
Because she,
she wants to,
like,
she wants him to,
like,
run away with her
and get out of this,
like,
awful suburb,
um,
and,
and go and do something else.
And what he instead does
is,
goes to the mum
of the boy
who,
that he was,
like,
using as his pretext
for,
like,
you know,
these fake sleepovers.
Amber Benson
from Buffy,
uh,
little cameo.
Yes.
Oh,
really fun.
to be like,
you have to call my dad
and tell him
that I have been lying
to him for years,
right?
And I need to tell him
to ground me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
This is actually
when we get the smash cut
switch to the grey jumper,
by the way,
is,
rather than,
rather than the previous one.
Yeah,
he's wearing a pink jumper
up to this point.
Maddie disappears
that summer
and,
uh,
Owen's mum dies
and the pink opaque
is mysteriously cancelled.
All that they find
of Maddie
is a burning TV
in her backyard.
Mm.
And we get this shot
of the TV burning.
Mm-hmm.
You know?
It's fucking good.
Mm.
And,
and we smash cut
eight years forward.
Oh,
every smash cut forward
hits you like a brick.
It's meant to,
it's meant to.
It's sort of like
time compression.
Oh, yeah,
I'm complimenting the movie.
Like,
uh,
because dysphoria
do be feeling like this,
uh,
sometimes.
Mm-hmm.
To just be like,
oh,
shit,
it is two years later
or whatever,
you know?
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Do you know the,
um,
the Anais Nin quote
about,
uh,
like,
uh,
sleepers and sleepwalkers?
No.
So,
Anais Nin,
you live like this,
sheltered in a delicate world
and you believe you are living.
Then you read a book,
Lady Chatterley,
for instance,
or you take a trip
or you talk with someone
and you discover
that you are not living.
That you are hibernating.
The symptoms of hibernating
are easily detectable.
First,
restlessness.
The second symptom,
when hibernating becomes dangerous
and might degenerate into death,
absence of pleasure.
That is all.
It appears like an innocuous illness.
Monotony,
boredom,
death.
Millions live like this
or die like this
without knowing it.
They work in offices,
they drive a car,
they picnic with their families,
they raise children,
and then some shock treatment
takes place.
A book,
a person,
a song,
and it awakens them
and saves them from death.
Some never awaken.
Wow.
Fucking NPC shit.
I can't imagine doing an analysis
where I saw the TV glow
without that quote now.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's fucking brilliant.
Thank you so much for that.
Yeah.
Eight years into the future,
Owen works in...
I saw the book glow.
My radioactive book.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Because Mary Curie's Netflix.
Owen works in a cinema
and his colleagues are men.
Oh my god.
Men.
Connor O'Malley hits the fucking movie.
And they are so gross
and so racist.
Mm-hmm.
His boss, I guess,
Owen walks in on him
with a sex worker,
a black sex worker,
mind you.
This is a white guy.
Mm-hmm.
And after seeing this
and sort of like
hurriedly excusing himself,
his boss kind of like
baits him about this
in public
with his other co-worker
to be like,
oh, do you want her number?
She thinks you're cool.
And we get the kind of
more naked threat
of like telling him
to look at him
because he won't make eye contact.
He still won't.
You know?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Blah.
On his way home,
he sees an unusual sight,
which is a tree
that had fallen down
and it's like
half-phased through the road.
Mm-hmm.
Like it's glitching.
Like it's like
the world has glitched.
There's like sparks
and TV static.
You know,
the sort of Elder Scrolls equivalent
would be a man
hovering above the ground
asking if you've been
to the Cloud District.
Mm-hmm.
It's like mammoths
glitching through the walls,
giant chickens and shit.
Like, huh,
that's kind of weird.
And there's also
a bunch of papers
scattered around
and he picks one of them up
and if you look closely,
I think he does say it,
they are pages
from the episode guide
about season six,
which never aired.
Mm-hmm.
Season six, episode one,
Escape from the Midnight Realm.
But it was cancelled
after season five,
so how can this possibly exist?
Mm-hmm.
So he goes home
and he goes home to his dad
who is like
aged and like
obviously infirm
and...
I've just written
the word bald.
And bald, yeah.
And he's still sitting,
some never awaken,
he's still on the TV
fucking like
grand people,
grand people.
He's still on the sofa
watching the same TV,
which is just
static and laughter.
Right?
Yeah.
And he just
stares at him.
Again, Fred Durst,
good actor surprisingly.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, he's so threatening.
Yeah, he's so scary.
It's interesting,
it's moved to a place
and I think this is also
like a common
and like this is an incisive thing
about like
abusive parents,
right,
is that like
you can find yourself
in the situation
where you are their carer
very, very easily.
And that is like
several different levels
of like toxic
and horrible.
We'd love to see an edit
of this where every shot
that had Fred Durst in
is just
has
keep rolling,
rolling,
rolling.
And then we cut back
and it stops
and then
just keep rolling.
It's like really quietly.
Yeah.
But dad,
I don't want
to make rap rock.
When he attacks him later,
it gets louder and louder.
I know why you want to hate me!
Because hate
is all the world
has even seen lately!
But yeah,
so Owen is standing there
crawling in the skin.
And he's...
Anyway,
tell me what you're gonna do now.
Well...
I love the horror
with which like
the mundanity
is depicted here,
right?
Because like
Owen
goes to a fucking
grocery store.
Oh, the color grading
in this shot.
And he's just like
by a vegetable section
picking vegetables out.
But like
it's a static shot
and he's doing it
and the lighting
is like
kill yourself,
kill yourself now.
Yeah.
It's so
fucking miserable.
Compare this to the
ending of
White Noise.
For instance,
right?
A movie which I will
recommend to anyone.
The lighting
and the color grading
it just sucks
all the life out of this.
And the greens
in this shot
of like
just vegetables
are like
beautiful
and how like
fucking awful
they look,
you know?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Incredible.
The shot is good too.
He's cut off at the waist.
It's just
half a person.
Anyway,
at this point
Maddie appears
and she's standing
like Napoleon Solo
on the other side
of the grocery store.
Maddie's fucking
T posing in the aisle.
Yeah.
Just standing normal
like she's just
spawned in
I guess
which kind of works.
Yeah.
Just standing there
like a fucking
Tory leadership candidate.
She's standing there
power-stanced up
to say
have you heard
of being transgender?
Yes.
Yeah.
Check this out.
She's going to say this
at length
in a
sort of like
sequence
that I find
kind of indulgent
but yeah.
Like obviously
he recognizes her
and he
like he hugs her
and she's like
and he's like
where have you been
for you know
the past
now 10 years
I guess.
And she's like
kind of cryptic about it
and she's like
I can't talk to you
about this here.
Follow me
outside of town.
Yeah.
There's somewhere
I know at the edge
of town.
007
the next location
is a gay bar.
Yes.
Yes.
Did you catch
the name of that gay bar?
It's called
The Double Lunch.
Mm-hmm.
The musical
the musical interlude
from the show.
And if you check
the runtime
this is at the exact
halfway point
of the movie
is the first
of these two
musical acts
that always happens
in the middle
of the episode.
Yeah.
Fucking
The song is called
Claw Machine
It's gorgeous.
How are you doing Phoebe?
I am an absolute lover
of like Phoebe Bridges
and everything that she does.
However I will say
I had to pause
and like laugh
at the line
my heart is like
a claw machine
it can't hold on
to anything.
I love this type of shit
but like come on
at some point.
It's very funny as well
because later on
we actually see
a claw machine
drop something
and it's like
oh.
The themes.
What's wrong with that?
No it's really
like I want to be clear
but I love this
to pieces.
I will never use
anti-schlock language.
I like this.
It's good.
Anyway.
It goes insanely.
So we get a whole
Phoebe Bridges song
right?
Yeah.
And about things
being just out of your reach
and not having the capacity
to like
hold things.
and then
Maddie hits Owen
with
the cold open.
Yeah the cold open.
Being like
do you remember
the TV show
that we watched?
Well it turns out
that actually being
trans
and being like
extremely traumatized
can have effects
on your memory.
And memory
is a very mutable thing.
Perhaps the way
that you have been
remembering things
is not
quite
right.
Yeah.
And we get this
this shot
inserted
here
of
not entirely sure
where this
where this incident
took place
but it's
it's of them
a couple years
ago we can tell
by the hairstyles.
I think it's in her
basement.
It must have been
in her basement.
Owen is trying
on a pink dress
in Maddie's bathroom.
Comes out of the bathroom
and smiles.
It's one of the only times
in the movie
we see him smile.
And they walk across
the football field
as Owen wears this dress
in the same way
that same dress
that Isabel
walked across.
The first shot
of Isabel
the first fucking episode
we see and watch
is that football field
that dress.
And so she asked him
do you remember
it as just a TV show?
Do you ever feel
like there is something
wrong with your memory?
Do you feel
that time isn't
moving normally?
Do you feel like
do you ever feel like
you blink
and two years have passed?
Do you feel like
you're just narrating
your own life?
Yeah.
It's funny.
And like his facial expression
is just like
no, no, yes!
This is shot
on reverse shot as well
so everything she's saying
is she's saying
directly to the camera.
Yeah.
It's just like
look and you
the audience
dead in the eyes
and be like
have you considered
being transgender?
Yeah.
It's pretty cool.
And he says
I don't know what you're
talking about
it's just a TV show
I watched it
like in your basement
it's fine
where have you been?
And she says
that's what I'm trying
to tell you
I've been in the show.
Yeah.
Because in the final episode
of season five
Mr. Melancholy
trapped the girls
in the midnight realm.
They were buried alive
in separate graves
dying with their hearts
cut out
locked in a freezer
and then we get this
like they are fed
this stuff called
Lunar Juice
which causes them
to forget their names
and their lives
and their hearts
and stuff.
And their powers.
They forget
they forget
that they're special
is one of the things
that comes up
you know.
And we get this scene
where Owen goes back
and he watches
this episode
and we see
Mr. Melancholy
at this point
and like
the special effects
are really
really good
it's no longer
this sort of cheesy
schlock
it's just a guy
with a moon
for a face
he does look
a little bit
like the moon
from the mighty
bush
or the guy
with cheese
for a face
of the mighty
which was unfortunate
but he has this
snow globe
that he says
you're going to be
trapped in here
and we look
inside the snow globe
and it contains
Owen
like young Owen
and his childhood
yeah
it's like
it's so good
this moon guy
explains the concept
of dysphoria
to you
right
I love the moon guy
I love the ice cream
guy from earlier
all the like
monsters that we see
inside the pink opaque
are like
really channel zero
type shit
really good
love them
fantastic
yeah
and
Owen tries to
fucking kill himself
it's
he tries to like
smash the TV
and climb in
yeah
and you hear
in the background
roll a roll
roll a roll
roll a roll
and then
into the scene
Fred Durst arrives
to beat him
to abuse him
in some manner
it's
also to save
his life
it's
yeah
it's not like
particularly like shown
it's more of a
he just like
pulls him out of there
Owen is screaming
and he like
like washes him
this isn't my home
this is
you're not my dad
yeah
I guess because his face
would have been
burnt by the TV
like by the electricity
so I read it
as he puts him
under the shower
because it's cold water
that could be it
that's pretty
but it's shot like
this is the most
horrifying thing
yeah
because it's not
he's not comforting him
he's not saying like
are you okay
what have you done
he doesn't say anything
he's wordless
he just pulls him
very roughly out of the TV
and puts him under the shower
yeah
and it's like
oh yeah wait
anyway
yeah
just before this scene
we do get the second
of the two musical numbers
which is a drag act
in the middle
it's a psychic wound
by King Woman
King Woman
hello
how are you doing
hello
hello
sire
again if you want
subtlety
this is the bit
where you like
get a close in
on Owen's face
with like
psychic wound
playing
you're not getting
subtlety
this is a finely crafted
knife against the eggs
we're not subtle
about anything
this is a fucking
sledgehammer
against the eggs
we'll talk more
about subtlety
in the wrap up
because I
yeah
it gets less and less
so Owen goes to see
Maddie at the high school
as arranged
and we get this
fucking
amazing monologue
like
it's like a five minute
just
uncut monologue
it's so good
it's so fucking
well acted
and Maddie explains
where she's been
she says
I moved to Arizona
I changed my name
it still felt really wrong
so and I was
I was just dying
I didn't know
what was happening
so
changed my name again
yeah
started a bunch of
podcasts
you know
dated a trans girl
for a while
didn't work out
and then she says
so
I had myself
buried alive
and
I was like
in this
coffin underground
I paid somebody
50 bucks
to bury me alive
I shit myself
like
pissed myself
dog
but then
I clawed my way up
and I woke up
and I'm fucking
Tara
I was in the TV show
Isabel
it's real
I was in season six
it's interesting
this like
burying yourself
alive thing
right
to express
transition
as a kind of
like
thing that exists
beyond dissociation
right
like
it's
it's not something
that
I relate to
as a framework
for it
but like
and I'll get to
some of my feelings
about dissociation
and why I kind of
like
feel so mixed
about this film
later
but like
it coheres
in the thing
right
to be like
if you experience
dysphoria
as this kind of
like
flat
greyness
like
the way out
is through
you know
yeah
so I had two readings
on this
one is that I am
not every trans person
has this
but I am the type
of trans person
who's like
I died
and came back
different
and not everybody
has that
that's fair
but I was very
I remember like
bagging up my old
clothes and taking
them to the charity
shop and been like
oh this guy's dead
like this is what
you do when people
die
so if you're that
kind of trans person
then fair enough
this might like
really hit with you
the other thing
I thought about
this one is that
being closeted
and trans
can be a very
traumatic experience
but it's also
if you are not
the sort of trans person
who knows
that you're trans
from an early age
it can be a trauma
that you're not
allowed to know
or think about
hey that's me
that one's me
yeah
the trauma
the dare not
speak its name
so this kind of
you have to go back
and bury yourself
alive in order
to go through it
can
I read it as like
you have to acknowledge
that this happens to you
you have to acknowledge
that you are buried alive
and that you need
to get out of it
and you need to revisit
this trauma
in order to like
realize that it's there
and realize what the answer is
so anyway
she says
I got out
I was in the show
I'm Tara
and then you were still there
so I drank the lunar juice again
and I came back to rescue
it's interesting
that she also mentions
I keep saying she
by the way
looking considerably more masculine
at this point
and wearing a binder
when Maddie has returned
that she's got
I'm gonna stick with she-her
just to make things easier
but like her hair
is very very short
also in this case
it's more like
she has returned
to the universe
of being a she-her
for a second
to try and pull her friend
out of it
yes
but yeah
the other thing
that I noticed about this
is she mentions like
not remembering
it
like pre-transition
right
it existing
this kind of like
retrospectively
all of this dissociation
and dysphoria
existing like a hallucination
right
it's like it happened
to someone else
or like it didn't happen
at all
you know
yeah
and the big hit here
is
and I was me
I was finally me again
and it was the season 6 premiere
you know
fucking amazing
and Owen
says
this is insane
which I love
what the fuck
are you talking about
yeah
yeah
nuts
no way
I have all these memories
there's no way they're fake
the matrix is real
it can't tell me who I am
yeah
no
the world just sucks
it's the
this isn't the midnight realm
it's just the suburbs
it's the same thing
it's the same
yeah
yeah
I grew up in the suburbs
I did
same
same
wow
I did not
I was in the middle
of a little village
there you go
but
yeah
and he
he like
thinks back to
watching
TV
and insists again
that like
no this was just like
it was just a show
that we watched
I remember watching it with you
and she says
your memories were put there
to distract you
to keep you trapped
which again
many such cases
you know
memory and lack of memory
and like
changing of memory
this was where
I was going to mention
the Anais Nin quote
and it's why I have it
in my notes here
and she says
well let's go
let's go
I found a spot
by the football field
we're going to bury ourselves alive
we're going to get the fuck out of here
let's go
and they cross the football field
and Owen
pushes her over
and runs away
yeah
Owen bottles it
yeah
repress
he just represses
you can't force
someone to transition
this is Maddie's mistake
yeah
which is
a problem for a movie
that really is trying to
this is
this is Maddie's mistake
she's being too prescriptive
about this
like
my
it took me a bit
to get to this
I had to watch the second
and don't actually
fucking think about this
like
in this manner
but I
Maddie's in the same situation
as Owen here
Maddie's only gotten out
and she's gotten out
by putting herself
into such a dangerous position
that she's like
either I die
and I am still
Maddie
or I fucking just like
fight through this
and I am Tara
right
and she is trying to do
the exact same thing again
it's not that she's someone
who has all the answers
it's that she's someone
who has
one answer
and that answer is
bury him alive
yes
yeah
and he bottles
like quite understandably
because she's like
no no no
like
transitioning is painful
like it's
it's hard
you have to push
through it
and he can't do that
the opportunity
that you're presented
to do it
might
not
necessarily be
the like
only or best way
to do it
and it might be insane
it might be
completely fucking insane
it might be crazy
it might be letting
your cool friend
bury you alive
at the school field
you know
also there's no
there's no guarantee
that burial alive
would be a way
that works for Owen
like we assume
that this would work
and it would be the same
for both of them
but it might not
like maybe
Maddie's quote unquote
transition has like
different rules
they don't all look the same
you know
it's like a rescue mission
as well right
and I think the thing
is that like
the lesson here
is not just that
you can't force someone
to transition right
but like
what is it they say on planes
like secure your own mask
before trying to help others
right
like
yeah
and that's the situation
that Maddie is in
secure your own mask
yeah
very good
yeah
yeah
yeah
absolutely
but yeah
so
Owen pushes her over
and runs
yeah
he bottles it
and then
Koomst Among Us
has not fumbled
this bag
you know
I know
I don't think
there is a trans person
out there
who transitioned
like even if you
transition to age
like one
or something
there's probably
still a time
where you're like
I reckon that doesn't
apply to me
you know
yeah
the first push
isn't going to be
the one that topples you over
like
it happens
yep
yep
yep
takes
takes
takes
takes
a few
it takes
a couple
you do it
you do it
but unfortunately
Maddie only had the one in her
and Owen
never sees her again
yeah
he goes back
and he tells us again
the audience and direct address
I never saw Maddie again
because I wanted her to come back
and force me underground
but she never did
yeah
you can force yourself underground
you can just do it
yeah but you can
you absolutely can
it's something we'll get to
but like
it is a certain point
that you're like
you know the joke
about the
the religious guy
on the roof
in a flood
do you know this one
no
no
hit me
okay so
guy's town floods
he gets up on the roof
he prays to God
and he's like
God please save me
from this flood
um
and a boat comes past
and he's like
hey do you want to get in this boat
and he's like
no no
God will save me
so he keeps praying
he's like
God
God please save me
from this flood
and the floodwaters
are creeping higher
and uh
this time a second boat
like a coast guard boat
comes past
and he's like
hey
get on the boat
and he's like
no no no
God's gonna save me
and the floodwaters
are creeping higher
and higher up the roof
and he's praying like
God please save me
and a helicopter comes past
and lowers a rope
and they're like
hang on to the rope
and we'll lift you out
and he's like
no no
God will save me
and the floodwaters
get higher
and higher
and higher
and the guy drowns
and he gets to heaven
and he speaks to God
and he's like
I you know
I've believed all my life
I was praying
fervently for aid
why didn't you help me
why did you let me die
and God says
I sent you two boats
and a fucking helicopter
what more do you want
that's it
but unfortunately
the helicopter in this case
is Maddie going
I'm going to bury you alive
and it will suck
it will suck so bad
and you have to do it
you're gonna have to
shit yourself in a coffin
really fucking understandably
he goes
you know
he just leaves
not to like double down
on the grand people
grand people thing
but like
one of the things about like
trans friendships
and like trying to
pull each other out of this
like morass
that we find ourselves in
is that often the ways
in which we do it
can be a little bit
fucked up
right
like
sometimes tremendously
fucked up
do not
do not go on 4chan
ever
oh yeah
yeah
I remember the way
Egg IRL
bullied Drammels
to try to come out
for like fucking
three years
it's like
we can't do this
we can't do it like this
whilst we're
fucking on that subject
fucking finster
I remember trans
Twitter going after
them for fucking
ages
every fucking day
yeah
I remember people
getting so mad at them
too and like
meanwhile I was just like
shut the fuck up
like back off
you don't know
what's going on
by the same thing
there are wrong ways
to be trans
according to a trans
community
that's just the way
of things
I remember the thing
that sort of
was the final
well it started
the domino chain
that cracked my egg
was just somebody
saying to me
have you been
questioning your gender
and my answer
was like
well
define questioning
and I was just like
oh no
that's a really
weaselly answer
that's not helpful
I've been thinking
about it
yeah
and like
some of us
are lucky enough
to find ourselves
in positions
where we have
like other trans
people to help us
some of us
aren't
one of the reasons
why
some of us aren't
yeah one of the reasons
why I struggle
to relate to this movie
is that
my transition
is like
and again
this is also
something that we're
going to talk about
memory is like
the way I remember
it
which may not
be accurate
is that it was
something that I
more or less
did myself
right
and I didn't have
anybody like
reaching out for me
in that way
and but yeah
sometimes when you do
and this is something
that like
the people's joker
does very very
effectively as well
is sometimes
there's also a very
like hurt
and damaged
person
you know
and sometimes
the results there
are really
like
troubling
you know
but it's
it's still
better than
than
repressing
is the thing
still better than
repressing
we have to
drive that home
so we get the
most brutal
time skip
of all time
not just yet
because
we gotta
themes
themes
themes
themes
because
as Owen
walks home
this is where
you get
what the movie
is like
the big emotional
pull for it
didn't really land
for me
which is
the chalk
marks
on the
street
as Owen
walks down
it
saying
there is
still
time
right
like
gasps
in the
theatre
choked up
upon this
the second
time
through
even though
I knew
it was
coming to be
there
didn't do
anything
I mean
I'm a
philist
it happens
to the best
of us
but Owen
keeps narrating
to us
sometimes I
wanted Maddie
to come back
she never did
sometimes I wondered
what if she was
right
but no
it's all just
a fantasy
my dad died
I stayed in the
house
I said it was
time for me to
become a real
man
a functioning
adult
yeah he's
he's bringing
a bigger TV
into his house
a nice little
fuck you to the
TV brand LG
here
because
their slogan is
life's good
in a kind of like
check it out
thing
and as
he's like
pulling the big TV
having replaced
the old TV
into his house
where we are told
he has a family
now
he has become
Fred Durst
Durst people
Durst people
Durst people
Durst people
Durst people
we get
we see on the
box that look
like LG
life's good
thing
just to be like
fuck you
Jane Chamberlain
I really like
for that
you know
it was really good
it's such a perfect
choice to not
show the family to
he says
I've got a family
now
you know
I love them
more than anything
and we never
see them
we don't see
them help him
bring the fucking
TV in
he just starts
like dragging it
like the most
decrepit cunt
on planet earth
and it's like
you are miserable
you are miserable
but he just
doesn't
he doesn't
he re-watches
the pink opaque
he says he can
get it on streaming
now
and it sucks
it turns out
it sucks
this time
yeah
it's like worse
it's like a completely
different show
yeah
and it's like
really naff
and childish
and like
Buffy sucks
now
you can't jump
in the same
river twice
you can barely
jump in the same
river once
like
yeah
yeah
fuck
yeah
it's like
cringe now
to him
I saw they
announced that
Balamori is coming
back by the way
and the comments
were absolutely
full of people
being like
I hope they
bring back
the original
cast
or like
it won't
be as good
now
and it's
like cunt
it's for
the kids
now
do you
remember
when we
lived in
that small
Scottish town
and you
were the
librarian
and I
was the
policeman
I've never
seen Balamori
to be fair
I basically
did live in
Balamori
when I grew
up
so like
listen
do you
remember
when you
were a
pony
um
unironically
the street
I grew up
on had a
Balamori
tier level
of fucking
like house
painting
right
and I
went back
a couple
of years
ago
and it
is all
like
brown
and like
pebble
dashed
and shit
now
and it's
like wow
I guess
you really
can't step
under the
same
river
so you
live in
Bryden
I'm so
so glad
that I
made us
watch
Dogtooth
before this
right
because
yeah this
is a
companion
piece
absolutely
the like
really
brutal
time skip
here
is
yes
now we
get it
is
and we're
getting
really into
horror here
is
20 years
later
for the
throat
Jane
and I
mean
the thing
is
right
chronologically
Owen
is like
30
something
here
right
yes
30
somethings
do not
look like
this
he looks
60
and like
insanely
chapped
lips
yeah
like
just like
a skeleton
of a man
like
yeah
yeah
the breath
work
it like
fades to
black
when he's
watching
the
when he's
watching
the like
the
the pink
opaque on
streaming
and it's
dog shit
this time
like
the fade
to black
on his
face
as he's
like
struggling
to breathe
it's just
visceral
and then it
hits you
with the
20 years
later
and you're
like
Jesus
Christ
Jesus
Christ
man
and he
has a
job
at
the
fun
center
restocking
the ball
pit
with balls
there is
a pink
opaque
video game
in the
arcade
at the
fun
center
which is
interesting
one
there's
also
like
there's
a kid's
birthday
party
going on
and the
kid gets
in like
a money
shower
I guess
they have
these in
America
where like
it throws
up money
and like
you try
and catch
it as
much as
you can
and then
above
there's
like a
little
glowing
panel
above
the
money
shower
that
O is
looking
at
and it
just
says
you're
dying
it's
so
good
this is
where we
see
the
claw
machine
literally
fail to
hold on
to
something
I'm
not
finding
the
horror
hugely
effective
here
to be
honest
but
like
he's
like
he sings
horribly
at this
birthday
party
for a
kid
who
is
like
obviously
also
like
egg
the
horror
hits me
like
no one's
business
no one's
business
christ
i didn't get
egg vibes
from the
kid
i got
little
vibes
no i
thought it
was like
we're
doing the
same
grand
people
grand
people
thing
again
anyway
not
important
to
the
thing
we see
he's
like
wheezingly
asthmatic
yeah
because not
transitioning
will make
your asthma
was
he's
struggling
to breathe
because he's
being buried
alive
that's what
they're going
for here
which i don't
want to talk
about asthma
like that
but fine
yeah
i mean i used
to have asthma
and i don't
anymore
so yeah
you're having
an asthmatic
crisis
you know
you should
fucking
transition
about this
you should
try transitioning
oh you can't
breathe
fucking idiot
try transitioning
i'm in the
respiratory medicine
ward with
like a
dark gun
full of
estradiol
just take the
test
you're in the
opposite of the
nhs
you're in the
shn
you're just like
transition prescribed
for everything
that's right
sprained ankle
transition
trans broken arm
syndrome
i'm putting it in
the water
i'm doing
you've transitioned
do it again
yeah
what we get is
is dog tooth again
and it asks the
same question
albeit with a
slightly more
pessimistic framing
right which is
do you believe in
media as an agent
of change of the
self or not
right because
owen is in the
bathroom
sort of like
no not yet
no well
hold on
hold on
this is the most
visceral scene in
the fucking movie
like the birthday
party
yeah that's what
the fucking gic
told me
yeah where he
starts fucking
okay he's he's at
this birthday party
they're all singing
happy birthday this
kid they're clapping
and clapping we're
cutting on him and
he just starts
screaming for help
like he just gives
in completely he's
just like i'm dying
i can't breathe you
have to help me
everyone else by the
way has gone
completely still
not responding at
all they've all
like shut down like
fucking marionettes
like they're not
touching it
and he's doing
this thing where
he's both
screaming for help
and begging
everyone to not
like look at him
to like don't
worry about it
i'm just doing
i'm like i feel
bad
like i felt
that
yeah
it's painful
it's really painful
then he goes into
the bathroom
and he cuts
himself open
with the box
cutter
uh from like
from the neck
down the sternum
do you believe
in media as an
agent of change
or not
because you have
some inside of
you
now
and even if it
takes a while to
out
ultimately
like you're gonna
get out of the
fucking car trunk
right or you're
gonna you're going
to find the tv
glow inside
yourself
because he's full
of light
now this
this reminded me
the fact that
part of my
master's project
when i went to
drama school
uh was a mime
where i just went
onto the stage
lay down on my
back and mimed
cutting myself
open with a
scalpel and i did
i like mimed it in
a very medically
accurate way like
pretended to swab
it like you know
all the right like
did it as you would
really have to do it
and like you know
did the sternum
crack and the bone
sore and everything
and it was all
completely mimed and
like pulled out my
heart and like put it
aside and then
stitched myself up
again and got up
and walked off and
it was just a mime
project did it all
with like breath work
and body work and
people said it was
like incredibly
fucking disturbing
like what was it
about and i was
like i don't really
know i think it's
got something to do
with masculinity
oh my god
it took me like two
years after that to
really oh that's what
that was about
i independently filmed
and starred in i saw
the tv glow and then
two years later i was
like wait a minute
also like at the same
time i wrote a play
about two guys living
in a flat who hate
each other but who
like have to work
together to keep a
monster from getting in
and then eventually
like one of them
is really mean and
one of them is really
meek and then
eventually the meek
one like overpowers
the mean one opens
the door and the
monster is just a small
girl and i was like
i don't know i don't
understand what this
is about
what's going on
don't really get it
whatever
this is so funny
for fuck's sake
like this is owens
being buried alive
right this this is the
moment that maddie got
to where you gain this
understanding that like
you are going to die if
you keep doing this and
this will be the body you
leave behind will be this
fucking man like is that
what you're gonna do is
that how you're gonna like
let yourself be forever
and it's the same thing
like you gotta you gotta take
out your own dog tooth
you know he cuts
himself open and he
goes damn that's crazy
but then and this is i
think i i love jane for
this decision so much
the final shot of the
movie is him clothes all
the way back on walking
out of the theater going
like sorry i'm really
sorry about earlier i'm
on a new medication i'm
really sorry everyone
like and we just and
then it gets the credits
and we never see him
again
yeah it leaves you to be
like if you identified
with this movie strongly
and you think it's so
obvious that the good
ending is that owen
comes out guess what
come out yeah you're the
movie yeah whether or
not this is a happy
ending is up to you now
yeah you could read this
as like oh he knows he's
getting out he's just
been like i'm just gonna
fake it he's gonna
bury himself or you could
read it as he represses
and it's like well which
is it like i don't know
up to you the first time i
saw this i was like no
no that's not the
ending they're faking
us out they're doing
and i sat through the
entire credits being like
no no these are fake
credits these aren't real
like there's gonna be
something else after the
credits don't worry this
isn't the end there's no
way that can be the
ending of the film sat
through the entire
credits to like the
fucking studio logos and
there was like what
for the throat before i
realized like oh i'm the
ending as it says like
there is still time right
and like as much of it as
you might sort of like
spend in this like
horrible prison right
there is like only one
moment alive in which it
is too late to do right
um and like that's not
intended to be like oh
it's fine just do it
later but it's like yeah
whenever it like happens
whenever it takes you
whenever it becomes like
um you know you're sort
of like forced out of the
building then yeah that's
a really weird poll that i
i used i'm like thinking
about a long article about
9-11 victims there were
like the medical examiner
had a real controversy
about how to write up the
deaths of people who
jumped from the windows
and then they ended up
going with like forced
from building because like
they didn't want to admit
that that was a choice
anyone could have like
made you know um anyway
i see yeah uh basically
you have to transition
your gender yeah my sort
of issues with this movie
are about the fact that i
did do that um i remember
doing this in fact it was
a whole thing still is and
i have i have a kind of
like personal thing here
and i have a kind of
like cultural thing here
which is the call to
action the personal thing
here is that i typically
experience a trans movie in
the form of i watch it go
hmm that interesting and
then dissociate for two days
um which is which is what i
did here um and i think
that that's true regardless
of what i think about the
movie and i think one of the
problems with this is that
it presents uh it's a
very like it's a movie
that jane churnman started
writing three months after
they started hrt right and
that shows in a lot of
ways right i don't think
that devalues it but i think
if you're in this position
as i am where you have been
on hrt you've been socially
transitioned for like the
better part of a decade
right and you are finding
that you are still doing
things like associating or
changing your name or
feeling time be weird then
you can respond to this in
a number of ways one of
which is what do you want
me to do here detransition
retransition again kill
myself like what are you
and it's turn it off and
on again exactly and
realizing that it's not for
you only partially
attenuates that and like
some of this stuff is just
like the human condition
and like yeah transition
isn't a magic bullet and
some of the stuff does
still it's you still feel
like this right and this
leads me to my my call to
action here right which is
that like transition
fascinating experience
obviously see why a lot
of people are drawn to a
tremendously uh important
and influential and
individual however not the
only trans experience far
from it indeed indeed i i
think that like this isn't
to detract from this movie
this isn't saying don't
make this movie i wish this
movie didn't exist right
uh it's it's to say that
like if you are going to
make art about being
trans you're gonna make
any kind of cultural output
about being trans i like
broadening it beyond that
because like you know
transition was a fucking
while ago for me right
like i'm not living in an
ending you know and like
it's not stuff that you
can kind of oh it feels
that way at the time maybe
to be like it's it's it's
season six i'm deep into
like season nine they've
had like two movies out
they're doing adaptations
and shit oh yeah like the
the transition isn't the
solution like it's the
precipitate exactly even
when they get out like
they're still like in season
six of the show there are
still monsters to fight
every week like yeah it
makes me very grateful for
any kind of trans art right
because i i want to see
more trans things that are
about like i don't know
any other aspect of the
human condition like doing
your fucking taxes give me
give me trans notting
hill you know like anything
and yet you didn't like
manhunt oh i mean that's
it's more of a i i didn't
like manhunt either i'm i'm
enjoying cuckoo though i'll
tell you that i'm reading it
at the moment just because i
want stuff about being trans
that is not just about
transition doesn't mean i'm
gonna like everything that's
about being trans that isn't
about transition or
conversely what about
wrath goddess sing
conversely that i'm that i
am gonna like everything
that is about transition you
know like i say even the
stuff that i don't like i'm
glad exists yeah but yeah i i
don't know i i think it's
you can take this movie a
little personally given how
individual it is i think you
can it can make you feel like
a bad transsexual particularly
if you you're in this
position of i not
remembering a lot of this
stuff right or not wanting
to like go back and and mine
some of this stuff for like a
podcast you know yeah yes
and i think you're right that
that once you do get out of
the midnight realm once you
sort of realize you're trans
this you then have to decide
what to do with it yeah that's
very much the first problem yeah
well you then you have to
decide what to do with it
right it's kind of like
discovering you've got fucking
mutant powers which is like
well okay now are you gonna
you gonna are you gonna hide
or are you gonna you know
become bitter and destructive
or are you gonna you're gonna
use your gifts for for all
mankind so that we can live
in peace uh wolverine like so
i'm founding the brotherhood of
evil trannies uh yeah yeah yeah
so yeah you come out and then
you're gonna decide what to do
with it and perhaps this is like
astonishingly fucking arrogant of
me to make this comparison but
this film reminded me a little
bit of the prince the play that
i wrote which was about trans
people being stuck in a kind of
midnight realm or be it like the
shakespeare multiverse and then
having to break out like go of
identities and relationships and
break out and so that that play
the final scene ends just as they
get out and then we don't really
see what happens after that there's
there is a hint that more needs to
be done but we don't see that stuff
being done and so yeah like i agree
with you november like this is a
story about coming out or rather
it's a coming out story about not
coming out but then that is not the
only thing that you have to do in
your trans it's like ah no that is
merely level one yes that is the
start i don't think it gives you all
the answers but i think very much
this is a movie that is designed to
crack one specific egg and it was
jane schoenbaum's one and me and i'm
like ah too late but thank you i agree
yeah yeah yeah and you but what she
happened to catch you as a stray i can
understand the benefit of making a
movie that is basically for yourself
pre-transition to be like
fucking get a grip yeah i did come
out you know absolutely i completely
understand it yeah i'm not like this
i'm not giving it a kind of a bad mark
for not including the whole trans
experience right like this movie isn't
isn't for me what the fuck no it's
just like i struggled to relate to it
um in part because of that like
honestly i'm gonna keep mentioning
this movie to the point that
eventually we'll have to watch it a
fantastic woman right very like issue
movie very didactic for cis people
very remedial in a lot of ways but i
really appreciated that it is uh
something that is in large part about
like yeah i don't have a like a
problem here everybody else has a
problem i am trying to get my shit
done you know what is your pick for
the bonus next isn't it god is it okay
well i in that case i'm i'm really 50 50
do we be very funny to do the people's
joke that's the other thing that i'm
thinking right that's why i'm on the
fence i why not because the people's
joker is uh i loved that film and again
like whichever one i i see i'm gonna
dissociate for two days watching it um so
which which one of those do i want to
do do we want to bear in mind that if we
make a podcast about the people's joker
everyone involved in it is definitely
going to listen to that podcast i hope
so because i have nothing but praise for
it like genuinely great i i would
genuinely love to what to talk about
it i haven't seen the people's joker yet
but my friend mia is in it so i would
like okay well in that case i i hope
we're excited for a very nepotistic
hour and change of me raving about how
fucking good that film is and how bad it
made me feel people's joker check it out
and in in the meantime uh do we have any
closing thoughts about i saw the tv glow
this film is really beautifully shot and
acted i want to work with the
cinematographer i want to work with the
production designer obviously want to
work with jane schoenberg uh every actor
in it i want to give them a big kiss
uh you want to work with a 24 make good
movies um yeah fantastic i i i found it
a bit much in places as i oh no i remember
what i was gonna say like i i like that
it is unsubtle because we have tried
making subtle movies about queer shit
before and cishet people still don't
fucking get it there are still people who
think that the x-men franchise is like
wait why are you making it woke and
political it's like you fucking idiots
right yeah there are still people who
think that the matrix is a cis film and
i'm like no you fine fine we'll fucking
make it as obvious as we can okay there's
there's a benefit to it so the point that
even the fucking sunday times review has
to mention there are some themes of
transsexuality may contain may contain
themes of a transsexual nature yes yeah so
i respect that yeah my closing statements
just come out gone do it do it pussy i
listen all right don't trust me completely
i'm very vested i'm just trying to
increase the amount of men in the world
because i'm gay
come out give it a go yeah life's too
short at the same time as i like roll my
eyes at the like uh being trans means
it's one way of understanding it
metaphorically it's like you're special
and you have powers trans people are some
of my favorite people and i i love us
and i love us being alive and around and
making art um so you know you gotta
you gotta be a part of that and if you
are then make a bunch of weird
individual shit about like your life or
other people's lives or just whatever
the fuck you feel like um because yeah
it's it's really like valuable yeah i
should be almost completely inaccessible
and i mean that
two cis people you you two are a space
um make make fucking trans notting hill
like genuinely yeah frothing hill oh
oh incredible incredible david off the
fucking ropes oh my word for david off
the buckle it's like tripping with your
dicks don't worry about it the star
