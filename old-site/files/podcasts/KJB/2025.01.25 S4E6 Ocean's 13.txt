0.00 25.36 SPEAKER_04  Hello and welcome to another episode of Kill James Bond. I am November Kelly. I am joined as always by my friends Abigail Thorne and Devon.
25.36 27.16 SPEAKER_03  I'm gonna fucking kill myself.
27.16 31.48 SPEAKER_04  I'm not, how we doing everyone, what's up?
31.48 65.04 SPEAKER_04  You join us in the midst of a conversation in which I staked out the position that my mental health has gotten significantly better the worse my own internal self-talk has been, and so when I'm really, really depressed I just think, oh god I don't know how I'm gonna get out of this, what I'm gonna do, I just have so many things to do. When my mental health is a bit more functional, I tend to think to myself, oh I'm gonna fucking kill myself and then I do the task, right?
65.04 71.72 SPEAKER_04  So on that basis we're now perfectly equipped to tell you what happens in Ocean's 13.
71.72 80.46 SPEAKER_05  Ocean's 13. Yeah I woke up this morning, I looked at my schedule, it said, remember everything that happens in Ocean's 13, 10am, and I went uh oh.
80.46 85.00 SPEAKER_03  Yeah god, more things happen in this one than did in the previous one.
85.00 87.00 SPEAKER_03  Yeah that's true. Lots of things.
87.00 91.48 SPEAKER_03  This one's also clearer, it basically tells you what the scam is gonna be at the start,
91.48 115.56 SPEAKER_04  which I quite like. I kind of feel like this one has, if anything, too many things, right? But so, if you're not familiar with the series, right, this is George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and their friends getting together to make first a remake of a Rat Pack movie in the 60s, which was an excuse for Sinatra to hang out, and then doing two sequels to that, of which this is the second.
115.56 149.72 SPEAKER_04  Mmhmm. And this is, by some way, the movie that like, assumes the most goodwill of its audience, this is a movie that's convinced that because you have spent four hours with Danny Ocean and Rusty Ryan, you are like their best friend for real, you're like pointing at the screen, you love all the little like references, you're just very, very happy to be there for Ocean 13. If you're not, if you're just like, if you're there as a hired gun, if you're there to do this for work for your podcast... If you're kind of done with these guys.
149.72 168.84 SPEAKER_03  Yeah. I enjoyed this one the most though, because the problem that we had with the second one is that the heist, which the film is ostensibly about, happens off screen and then it doesn't tell you anything about it, and there's no way you can figure it out. Whereas with this one, it does the opposite, it tells you like, pretty much in act one, here is what the heist is going to be, and then they do it.
168.84 178.84 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, I mean, you get kind of like a bunch of nested heists as well, which is nice as a kind of like, you know, compensation for the no heists in the second one. But yeah, it's like one big plan,
178.84 181.32 SPEAKER_05  and it has some problems midway through it, but they fix it.
181.32 181.40 SPEAKER_02  Big plan.
181.40 185.80 SPEAKER_05  It's, it's, I don't mind this one so much. This was a little bit, this is my favorite of the three.
185.80 189.56 SPEAKER_05  The plot was easier to follow, certainly. It's better than two, I will say that hands down.
189.56 208.84 SPEAKER_04  You know, I call a film indulgent a lot, you know, and this is hypocrisy, and I'm going to use, I'm going to illustrate that by way of an analogy. This movie feels like listening to a podcast from like the 500th episode where they've all got all of their own bits bedded in and you have to go and unpick them.
208.84 212.52 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, George Cooney just opens with, I'm going to fucking kill myself.
212.52 213.96 SPEAKER_03  And then it was like, what?
213.96 215.72 SPEAKER_04  And I was like, oh no, George.
215.72 222.68 SPEAKER_04  Every time Matt Damon is on screen, they do a bit about him being raised by fishermen, it doesn't really connect to anything, and you're just like, I don't.
222.68 224.12 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, they're really trying to make it work.
224.12 225.88 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, yeah, I don't know.
225.88 228.04 SPEAKER_05  Just desperate for that bit to land.
229.64 240.44 SPEAKER_05  The problem that I had is that I finished watching this, and due to a lack, a noticeable lack of Catherine Zeta-Jones in this movie, no Julia Rogers either, she's out of here.
240.44 244.12 SPEAKER_05  Julia Rogers? Julia Rogers looks almost exactly like Julia Roberts.
244.12 245.64 SPEAKER_05  No Julia Rogers in this shit either.
245.64 246.20 SPEAKER_05  That's true.
246.20 246.44 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
246.44 255.96 SPEAKER_05  And the mistake that I made is that I finished this up by immediately going on one of my multi-day Catherine Zeta-Jones binges, and I now remember the plot of Entrapment and Intolerable
255.96 257.56 SPEAKER_03  Cralty. That's how Michael Douglas got cancer.
257.56 257.96 SPEAKER_03  Perfectly.
257.96 267.24 SPEAKER_04  It's difficult when this happens, it's a real kind of like, not just staffing issue, but like you as a friend, we find you like face down and the guy is surrounded by Blu-rays.
267.24 270.44 SPEAKER_05  Just like, oh for God's sake, they've been on the Zeta-Jones again.
271.16 272.28 SPEAKER_05  We talked about this.
272.28 277.80 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, there's no Julia Roberts, there's no Julia Rogers, there's no Julia's of any description basically, because this movie is like...
277.80 283.80 SPEAKER_03  That's pretty much the first thing that happens is Brad and George Clooney meet, and George Clooney says, Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones will not be appearing in this movie.
283.80 284.28 SPEAKER_03  Yes!
284.28 284.84 SPEAKER_03  And we go, great, okay fine.
284.84 288.84 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, I thought that was a bit that they were going to do, and they were coming back later, but no, they mean it.
288.84 289.40 SPEAKER_04  No.
289.40 299.32 SPEAKER_04  They fully, they do the like, please put themselves retro studio logos and titles, and then we go, right, no women in this one, this is boys night, you know?
299.32 299.48 SPEAKER_04  Absolutely.
299.48 305.16 SPEAKER_04  This is like guys in Vegas having homosocial fun before the hangover.
305.16 307.56 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, heists are about women again.
307.56 308.20 SPEAKER_04  And yes.
308.20 311.16 SPEAKER_03  Actually no, heists are about the boys.
311.16 311.80 SPEAKER_04  That's true.
311.80 313.32 SPEAKER_04  This one is for the boys.
313.32 323.96 SPEAKER_04  So Danny Ocean, George Clooney, is being pulled out of retirement along with Brad Pitt, Rusty Ryan, Matt Damon, Linus, Linus Tech Tips, or whatever the fuck.
323.96 324.44 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, yeah.
324.44 325.32 SPEAKER_03  Whatever he's called.
325.32 333.08 SPEAKER_04  And they get to Vegas on an emergency basis because something has happened to Earth's oldest cunt.
334.28 340.04 SPEAKER_04  By the way, in the course of this, as they get off the plane, we get a perfect mob guy woe off of Damon.
340.04 340.52 SPEAKER_02  Whoa!
340.52 344.20 SPEAKER_04  Just like luxuriating that a little bit.
344.20 344.60 SPEAKER_04  Whoa!
344.60 345.00 SPEAKER_04  Whoa!
345.00 345.80 SPEAKER_04  Whoa!
345.80 347.32 SPEAKER_04  I got a lot of drops on this one.
347.32 348.44 SPEAKER_04  I'm finally figuring this shit out.
348.44 349.64 SPEAKER_04  Oh my god, I didn't get any.
349.64 355.00 SPEAKER_04  No, I have, let me see, eight, 12 drops from this movie, one of which is...
355.00 355.24 SPEAKER_04  All right.
355.24 355.64 SPEAKER_04  Whoa!
355.64 356.20 SPEAKER_04  Whoa!
356.20 357.32 SPEAKER_04  Whoa!
357.32 368.84 SPEAKER_04  If you remember from the previous two movies, Reuben, Elliot Gould, guy we love to see, cigar chewing, like big glasses, kind of Robert Evans, the Hollywood producer.
368.84 370.36 SPEAKER_04  100%.
370.36 376.92 SPEAKER_04  He's the guy who like bankrolls their heists initially, he's their like casino industry insider.
376.92 377.56 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
377.56 378.44 SPEAKER_04  Mm-hmm.
378.44 386.52 SPEAKER_04  And he's fucking dead now, because he tried to get into business with Al Pacino.
386.52 386.92 SPEAKER_03  Yes.
386.92 388.20 SPEAKER_03  I got a sale, yeah.
388.20 391.32 SPEAKER_03  Al Pacino, kind of looking a bit Donald Trump-ish.
391.32 393.96 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, he does do a Trump in this, like he fully does.
393.96 394.36 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
394.36 396.04 SPEAKER_03  He's like the fake tan and the hair.
396.04 399.40 SPEAKER_05  This is a rare like intermediate form of Al Pacino.
399.40 411.32 SPEAKER_05  Pacino scholars, such as myself, recognize several distinct eras of Pacino, and this is halfway between his like, scent of a woman whatever kind of era, and his like old man Pacino stuff.
411.32 412.12 SPEAKER_05  He's nearly there.
412.12 412.60 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
412.60 413.16 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
413.16 414.92 SPEAKER_05  He's cooking, he's percolating.
414.92 415.32 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
415.32 443.72 SPEAKER_04  There is still representation discourse that you can do here, in that like, Al Pacino is an alarmingly orangely tanned man from the South Bronx, whereas, you know, here he's playing functionally Donald Trump, who is an alarmingly orange tanned man from like Queens or Manhattan, depending on how you look at it. And yeah, I don't know if that's like appropriation or not, like I don't know if Donald Trump's costume is a costume, but he has tried to go into business with Al Pacino, who is...
443.72 444.76 SPEAKER_04  What's his name?
444.76 445.80 SPEAKER_04  Willy Bank.
445.80 446.76 SPEAKER_04  Willy Bank.
446.76 447.48 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
447.48 449.88 SPEAKER_04  Who is like another casino owner.
449.88 456.60 SPEAKER_03  And they're going to open this big new casino together, they're going to go 50-50, but Al Pacino, he Zuckerberg'd him out of it.
456.60 458.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, he Winklevosses him.
458.92 465.24 SPEAKER_04  Because he meets him in the casino under construction, and he's like, points at him and he's like, you're Winklevosses.
465.24 465.96 SPEAKER_04  Like...
465.96 469.72 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, you have been Winklevosses, please sign over all of your assets to me.
469.72 470.36 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
471.48 473.16 SPEAKER_03  You can say slurs in the casino now.
473.16 474.20 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
474.20 486.52 SPEAKER_04  It's clear that Reuven has been like, putting in the work, he like, comes to this meeting with his two big achievements that he's done, he's really excited, and then Pachino's just like, yeah, no, you're out.
486.52 487.08 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
487.08 494.76 SPEAKER_04  And he has an unnamed goon, who remains unnamed throughout, just kind of vaguely menace Reuven.
494.76 496.76 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, it's a vague threat.
496.76 499.56 SPEAKER_03  He's like, what, if I don't say yes, you're going to throw me off the roof?
499.56 500.84 SPEAKER_03  And he goes, well, I don't want to.
502.28 503.96 SPEAKER_03  That's about as sinister as this movie gets.
503.96 506.68 SPEAKER_03  The stakes are not really life and death.
506.68 524.28 SPEAKER_04  It's interesting as well, because Bank, Pachino, like, he kind of like, he cuts him out of the casino, and Reuven says, you don't do that because like, old Vegas, right, there's a code, we're both guys who shook Sinatra's hand, right?
524.28 526.20 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, and that means something, you know?
526.20 528.52 SPEAKER_04  It used to mean something in this town.
528.52 530.36 SPEAKER_03  What exactly does that mean?
530.36 542.76 SPEAKER_04  Okay, we didn't get to talk about this very much on Oceans 11, spelled out 11, but like, Frank Sinatra was like, a depraved thug and rapist, who was like...
542.76 543.80 SPEAKER_04  Oh, certainly.
543.80 551.88 SPEAKER_04  ...beloved of guys who liked to like, weep into their drinks because they had never heard two notes of music in the same song before.
551.88 566.84 SPEAKER_04  And it's just this cult around him is very, very strange, but it's even stranger to make a movie like, that really makes it into a real thing that reifies it in the year this came out, you know?
566.84 567.24 SPEAKER_04  2007.
567.24 577.56 SPEAKER_03  And also suggests that it should be the basis of business contracts, because Reuven's like, we both shook Sinatra's hand, you know, there's a code amongst guys who shook Sinatra's hand, I'm not going to say what that code is.
577.56 583.80 SPEAKER_04  It's kind of religious, like mythological Sinatra here, it's like, you know, in Sinatra's name,
583.80 591.32 SPEAKER_05  Sinatra's eye, all blue eyes be upon you. I'm fascinated by the historicity of Frank Sinatra, you know, like, we could prove that he exists.
591.32 591.80 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
592.84 597.88 SPEAKER_04  He was a minor lounge singer, we can say that much, in a remote province of the American Empire.
597.88 602.20 SPEAKER_03  There were several lounge singers at the time, but he just happened to become quite popular.
602.20 609.24 SPEAKER_04  He hung out with a number of apostles, it's difficult to say what remains of his teachings, besides like ring-a-ding-ding.
609.24 614.28 SPEAKER_05  I'm using the rubric of embarrassment to like, prove that Ocean's Eleven spelled out actually happened.
614.28 618.20 SPEAKER_05  Like, they wouldn't make that kind of thing up, he got embarrassed.
619.72 629.40 SPEAKER_05  But they try to insist that this is some sort of casino owner Bushido code, where like, if you've met Frank Sinatra you can't fuck each other over, because you're like an old head.
629.40 630.36 SPEAKER_05  Yes.
630.36 634.04 SPEAKER_05  And Al Pacino goes, no, I don't give a fuck about that.
634.04 635.16 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, he's right!
635.16 636.44 SPEAKER_04  He's completely right!
636.44 636.52 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
636.52 649.40 SPEAKER_04  Like, it's so strange to insist upon this, just because, like, because Sinatra made the movie that you're now riffing off of, you know?
649.40 658.36 SPEAKER_05  But he finished it off by Bank renames the casino to The Bank or whatever, and that is finally enough, and that makes Ruben have his heart attack.
658.36 659.32 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, his heart explodes.
659.32 663.00 SPEAKER_03  So he's not actually dead, we said he's dead, but he's not dead, he has a broken heart!
663.00 663.32 SPEAKER_04  No, he's just...
663.32 664.52 SPEAKER_04  My casino!
664.52 664.92 SPEAKER_04  Oh!
664.92 677.96 SPEAKER_04  If you want to sense how perfunctually this is done, he's in bed, the whole gang are like, at his bedside, and we get de rhetorical questions doctor, to speed us through the scene even quicker, who's just like, will he get better?
678.52 679.32 SPEAKER_04  I don't know, maybe.
679.32 679.80 SPEAKER_04  Uh...
679.80 681.96 SPEAKER_04  What will make him get better?
681.96 683.32 SPEAKER_04  Uh, family, probably.
683.32 683.96 SPEAKER_04  Summon.
683.96 684.92 SPEAKER_04  Family heist of some kind?
684.92 686.04 SPEAKER_03  If you go to like a found family?
686.04 689.48 SPEAKER_03  He has a broken heart, how could you heal his broken heart?
689.48 689.96 SPEAKER_03  With crime?
689.96 690.36 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
690.36 690.60 SPEAKER_03  Yes.
690.60 690.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
690.92 691.88 SPEAKER_05  Certainly crime.
691.88 696.28 SPEAKER_03  I like that the gang, I like that they immediately go, well, we're gonna murder Al Pacino, right?
696.28 696.84 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
696.84 699.00 SPEAKER_05  Obviously we're gonna fucking pop this guy.
699.00 724.12 SPEAKER_04  One of the two Mormon brothers, fucking like, Tracklin or whatever, says, I'm going to get close to Bank, and I don't care if it gets messy, um, but so yeah, they're just gonna kill him, they're just gonna kill him, and uh, instead it's...
724.12 730.76 SPEAKER_03  So we're gonna call the Ouija, we're gonna wait for him outside, and it's three shots with a 3D printed gun, and that's how we're gonna do it.
730.76 740.12 SPEAKER_04  I should say, in this scene, because Don Cheadle is present, he is wearing the weirdest leather jacket I've ever seen.
740.12 741.56 SPEAKER_04  I just wanna pull this out here.
741.56 745.88 SPEAKER_04  He's got like two pockets over the kind of like breasts, right?
745.88 747.48 SPEAKER_04  Not that unusual in a leather jacket.
747.48 753.40 SPEAKER_04  However, they're like circular, cross-belted with an o-ring in the middle.
753.40 761.24 SPEAKER_04  It looks like, if you put this in like a black jacket instead of brown, it looks like it belongs in Cruising. It's one of the strangest...
761.24 764.76 SPEAKER_04  It looks like he's got like, tear-away tip panels on this jacket, and I just...
764.76 767.80 SPEAKER_04  It completely like, took me out of the rest of the scene.
767.80 775.32 SPEAKER_04  The rest of the scene is Danny Ocean being like, we're not gonna kill him, because that's not the genre of movie we're making.
775.32 778.36 SPEAKER_04  We're going to give him like a second chance.
778.36 784.68 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, we're gonna, you know, offer to heist something for him in exchange for giving Ruben his share back.
784.68 789.72 SPEAKER_03  So Clooney goes to Al Pacino and he makes this offer to him, it's all in crime gibberish language.
789.72 795.72 SPEAKER_03  And I like that Al Pacino was just like, no, there's nothing you can offer me, I already have all the money in the world, fuck you.
795.72 796.04 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
796.04 796.60 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
796.60 797.56 SPEAKER_03  Which I really like.
797.56 797.96 SPEAKER_03  Sick.
797.96 804.12 SPEAKER_04  He does kind of lay out all of the stuff that he has that you could heist at this moment, which I think is a little...
804.12 805.16 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, this was a bad call.
805.16 806.20 SPEAKER_04  ...hubristic.
806.20 808.92 SPEAKER_04  He's like, you know, I have everything I could possibly want.
808.92 821.80 SPEAKER_04  I have this massive casino that's gonna open and make a bunch of money, and it's gonna get the five diamonds award for like best hotel casino, like I've done four or five other times before.
821.80 826.04 SPEAKER_04  And they give me a diamond necklace each time and they're all up here in this vault.
826.04 828.76 SPEAKER_04  Um, it's like, okay, man, sure.
828.76 832.52 SPEAKER_03  He also says, uh, he also says don't, he's like, don't fuck with me.
832.52 834.84 SPEAKER_03  I slice like a goddamn hammer.
834.84 835.32 SPEAKER_03  And I'm like...
835.32 835.88 SPEAKER_03  Mm.
835.88 836.36 SPEAKER_03  What?
836.36 837.16 SPEAKER_03  I kind of like this.
837.16 838.20 SPEAKER_04  Al Pacino, baby.
838.20 838.60 SPEAKER_03  It's just like...
838.60 840.04 SPEAKER_03  What are you doing with a...
840.04 840.60 SPEAKER_03  What are you doing with a...
840.60 841.88 SPEAKER_03  You're doing a slice with a hammer?
841.88 842.04 SPEAKER_03  What?
842.04 852.52 SPEAKER_04  Trying to hold my shit together and be like intimidating, and I say something like that, and I just kind of go, okay, cool, good meeting, and I go into my phone, into the calendar, I put fucking kill myself.
852.52 856.60 SPEAKER_04  I just cancel the rest of my appointments, you know?
856.60 857.16 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, yeah.
857.16 858.28 SPEAKER_03  Slice like a goddamn hammer.
858.28 858.92 SPEAKER_03  Strange.
858.92 867.72 SPEAKER_04  And this is the thing, I like my little headcanon here of this is just like an authentically fucked up thing you would say by accident, and he's thinking about it for the whole rest of the movie.
867.72 868.60 SPEAKER_04  Definitely.
868.60 873.32 SPEAKER_04  He's just like going over it in his head, like, why did I tell that guy I sliced like a hammer?
873.32 874.36 SPEAKER_04  What was wrong with that?
874.36 874.84 SPEAKER_04  What?
874.84 877.00 SPEAKER_05  He's waking up like two nights later and just been like,
877.00 879.80 SPEAKER_04  what the fuck did I... Did I say slice like a hammer?
879.80 883.16 SPEAKER_04  Six years later, Al Pacino sits, bowls up, right in bed.
883.16 884.44 SPEAKER_02  He's just like, oh, fuck.
884.44 898.44 SPEAKER_04  It's like they all run together in one kind of compilation, it's like the time he called the teacher mum, the time he told Danny Ocean he sliced like a hammer, like a time he fell over one time.
898.44 900.52 SPEAKER_03  I still remember the time I accidentally called the teacher mum.
900.52 902.92 SPEAKER_04  I mean, yeah, it sticks with you.
902.92 904.36 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, I did it year one and it's still there.
904.36 904.76 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
904.76 907.32 SPEAKER_05  Mrs. Scarrett, you aren't my mum, I know that now.
907.32 907.88 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
907.88 908.28 SPEAKER_04  Sorry.
908.28 914.28 SPEAKER_04  It doesn't leave you, it doesn't leave you, it sticks around, it's in the compilation reel, it's terrible.
914.28 915.40 SPEAKER_04  Um...
915.40 920.84 SPEAKER_04  Basically, what we then get is a cut that says six months later, and if you think...
920.84 923.08 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, I'm reading the plot right now and I'm still lost.
923.08 946.68 SPEAKER_04  If you think about this as a sequence of events, right, Al Pacino has fucking heart attack gunned their boy, they have come to him and explicitly like, kind of quasi-threatened him, kind of made him an offer he can't refuse, he has refused it, and then nothing has happened for six months. If you're Al Pacino, bar the slice like a hammer thing, you're feeling pretty good about this.
946.68 948.36 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, you're not even remembering this meeting.
948.36 961.80 SPEAKER_03  The casino is almost done, and the opening is coming up, so they're planning this revenge heist, and so Susie Izzard has to come to Vegas so that they can explain to her what the heist is going to be, and ask for her help.
961.80 962.36 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
962.36 982.84 SPEAKER_03  And her outfit in this, this is Susie Izzard but she's still in the closet, her outfit in this is an all black shirt, an all black tie, and then a black pinstripe suit, and there is a photo of me at the age of 18 wearing this outfit because I saw it in this movie.
982.84 988.84 SPEAKER_04  It's once again, it's the people's joker, me a faggot joke again.
988.84 997.00 SPEAKER_03  I saw it in this movie, and I was like damn Susie Izzard is really really cool in this, she even has the goatee, and I'm just like oh my god, it's so...
997.00 998.04 SPEAKER_03  Susie babe.
998.04 1010.84 SPEAKER_04  If you ever tried to wear a dark suit, black shirt, colorful tie, you are transgender now, I hope you know if you don't then you have to transition.
1010.84 1020.28 SPEAKER_03  I just remember having such clear memories, it was like wow, that person's really cool, I want to be like that person, if I have to be this way, I want to be a man in the way that that...
1020.28 1021.32 SPEAKER_03  It's just like oh no!
1021.32 1022.04 SPEAKER_05  It's just so wow.
1022.04 1022.60 SPEAKER_05  No.
1022.60 1023.16 SPEAKER_05  No.
1023.16 1024.68 SPEAKER_05  Huge misfire on there.
1024.68 1025.16 SPEAKER_05  Yeah!
1027.80 1028.20 SPEAKER_05  Anyway.
1028.20 1031.64 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, if you're listening to this and you've ever worn a suit like that, David.
1031.64 1032.12 SPEAKER_05  Mm.
1032.12 1033.00 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1033.00 1038.60 SPEAKER_04  So what we get is like a set up montage, right, where we go through all the shit in the casino.
1038.60 1052.76 SPEAKER_04  There is one shot of Pacino talking to a significantly taller, and it's Pacino, not hard, but a significantly taller blonde woman, and when I watch this, this is just perfect like, physical comedy, I actually fumbled my whole notebook.
1052.76 1053.40 SPEAKER_04  So...
1053.40 1059.08 SPEAKER_04  If you had a sense of kind of where I'm at, I like just dropped all my notes.
1059.08 1062.92 SPEAKER_03  But speaking of blonde women, Al Pacino has a right hand woman.
1062.92 1063.48 SPEAKER_04  Yes.
1063.48 1065.48 SPEAKER_03  And it is Cameron Diaz.
1065.48 1066.52 SPEAKER_04  It...
1066.52 1068.60 SPEAKER_04  Is it?
1068.60 1069.32 SPEAKER_04  No it isn't.
1069.32 1070.28 SPEAKER_04  Is it?
1070.28 1070.92 SPEAKER_04  No it's not.
1070.92 1071.96 SPEAKER_03  I'm pretty sure it is.
1071.96 1074.52 SPEAKER_04  It's Ellen Barkin, this shit got me Ellen Barkin.
1074.52 1075.08 SPEAKER_04  It's not...
1075.08 1076.04 SPEAKER_04  What?

1078.20 1079.64 SPEAKER_03  Wait, no, no it's not.
1079.64 1081.32 SPEAKER_03  That's Cameron Diaz?
1081.32 1081.64 SPEAKER_05  You...
1081.64 1083.40 SPEAKER_05  Sorry, you're talking about Abigail, right?
1083.40 1083.80 SPEAKER_05  Like the...
1083.80 1084.68 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1084.68 1085.96 SPEAKER_05  Oh, definitely not Cameron Diaz.
1085.96 1087.00 SPEAKER_05  No, that's not Cameron Diaz.
1087.00 1087.40 SPEAKER_05  What?
1087.40 1088.52 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, no, I have to look this up like...
1088.52 1089.48 SPEAKER_04  You have face blindness.
1089.48 1090.68 SPEAKER_04  She doesn't look anything like her.
1090.68 1090.84 SPEAKER_04  Ellen Barkin.
1090.84 1091.80 SPEAKER_04  Are you shitting me?
1091.80 1094.60 SPEAKER_04  We did three Charlie's Angels movies.
1094.60 1095.16 SPEAKER_04  That's...
1095.16 1096.28 SPEAKER_05  That's just not her.
1096.28 1097.24 SPEAKER_04  No.
1097.24 1097.96 SPEAKER_03  That is...
1097.96 1099.08 SPEAKER_03  It's the same...
1099.08 1099.80 SPEAKER_03  That's...
1099.80 1100.68 SPEAKER_05  It's the same face.
1100.68 1101.56 SPEAKER_05  No, I'm with you.
1101.56 1101.96 SPEAKER_03  That's...
1101.96 1103.80 SPEAKER_03  That's just old Cameron Diaz.
1103.80 1104.76 SPEAKER_03  You're shitting me.
1104.76 1106.36 SPEAKER_03  I don't believe these women are...
1106.36 1107.00 SPEAKER_03  What?
1107.00 1108.52 SPEAKER_05  These white women all look the same to me.
1108.52 1109.48 SPEAKER_04  Oh my God.
1109.48 1117.00 SPEAKER_04  Are you doing a kind of like gang stalking beef against Ellen Barkin to be like you and Cameron Diaz are the same one?
1117.00 1117.48 SPEAKER_03  I'm...
1117.48 1121.32 SPEAKER_03  I am looking at her now and I'm like, this is just Cameron Diaz.
1121.32 1121.96 SPEAKER_04  You can't...
1121.96 1122.68 SPEAKER_03  Ellen Barkin.
1122.68 1123.72 SPEAKER_05  I'm like, I don't think so.
1123.72 1126.20 SPEAKER_03  I'm looking at like 20 pictures of her and like, this is...
1126.20 1127.32 SPEAKER_03  What?
1127.32 1130.04 SPEAKER_04  This is the shit that was happening in the prestige.
1130.04 1131.00 SPEAKER_03  Um, so...
1131.00 1131.56 SPEAKER_03  Oh my God.
1131.56 1134.12 SPEAKER_03  I'm so sorry to Ellen Barkin if you're listening.
1134.68 1135.40 SPEAKER_03  Excuse me.
1135.40 1136.84 SPEAKER_03  I'm crossing out Cameron Diaz.
1136.84 1137.40 SPEAKER_03  I'm running this.
1137.40 1138.12 SPEAKER_03  This is Ellen Barkin.
1138.12 1139.80 SPEAKER_03  Ellen Barkin is introduced.
1139.80 1150.84 SPEAKER_04  She's the like, uh, you know, the right hand woman and she's seen bullying, uh, like a waitress about her weight, right?
1150.84 1152.60 SPEAKER_04  She's doing toxic femininity.
1152.60 1153.64 SPEAKER_04  Mm.
1153.64 1161.00 SPEAKER_04  And, uh, the boys are kind of like, we've gotten slightly woker than we did in Ocean's 12, where it's just Matt Damon.
1161.00 1167.08 SPEAKER_04  Matt Damon's been sending them out some literature and they've been reading it because, uh, they're like, this is terrible.
1167.08 1167.64 SPEAKER_04  This is...
1167.64 1168.84 SPEAKER_04  Highly illegal.
1168.84 1170.20 SPEAKER_04  And it turns out that the...
1170.20 1171.08 SPEAKER_04  Highly.
1171.08 1171.80 SPEAKER_04  Highly illegal.
1171.80 1181.24 SPEAKER_04  Uh, the loophole that allows them to, like, police their waitress's appearance like this, is that they aren't waitresses, they are...
1181.24 1182.60 SPEAKER_04  And I mostly just get this for the drop.
1182.60 1183.80 SPEAKER_04  Models who serve?
1183.80 1185.40 SPEAKER_04  Just useful to have...
1185.40 1186.36 SPEAKER_04  Models who serve.
1186.36 1186.84 SPEAKER_03  Models who serve.
1186.84 1187.96 SPEAKER_03  All models serve.
1187.96 1191.96 SPEAKER_04  They also serve who only stand and walk.
1191.96 1194.12 SPEAKER_04  Um, so, what else we got here?
1194.12 1197.08 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, this is for being four pounds too fat or whatever.
1197.08 1197.48 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, yeah.
1197.48 1212.52 SPEAKER_05  Um, okay, yeah, so, sorry, the stakes of this is they're going to prevent the bank casino from winning that diamonds award, um, and they're gonna rig all of the casino's games to pay out massive on opening night.
1212.52 1213.40 SPEAKER_04  He's gonna lose.
1213.40 1214.44 SPEAKER_04  And, like, ruin him or whatever.
1214.44 1218.36 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, but they're not gonna, like, benefit in any way, it's just to fuck with him.
1218.36 1219.96 SPEAKER_04  No, it's qui bono.
1219.96 1220.28 SPEAKER_04  Mm-hmm.
1220.28 1220.76 SPEAKER_03  Everybody.
1220.76 1221.48 SPEAKER_03  Which I quite like.
1221.48 1221.64 SPEAKER_03  Okay.
1222.04 1223.88 SPEAKER_03  Um, because, because bank is in...
1223.88 1231.40 SPEAKER_03  Bank took out some big loans to finance his casino, so he needs to make 500 million in his first quarter to make it back, or he's gonna lose the business.
1231.40 1239.16 SPEAKER_03  So they're like, we need to make him lose 500 million dollars on opening night by rigging all of the games in the casino so everybody wins.
1239.16 1239.56 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1239.56 1240.12 SPEAKER_04  Kind of compelling.
1240.12 1240.68 SPEAKER_03  Which is a fun...
1240.68 1241.64 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, it's a cute idea.
1241.64 1245.88 SPEAKER_04  And Susie Asa goes through all the aspects of their plan with them.
1245.88 1248.76 SPEAKER_04  She's a kind of, like, heist consultant in this bit.
1248.76 1249.16 SPEAKER_04  Yes.
1249.16 1254.84 SPEAKER_04  Where she's like, okay, well, give me another montage, right, of all the shit you've been fucking with.
1254.84 1265.56 SPEAKER_04  Um, so the way they've rigged the craps games, in particular, is notable, because the two, well, one of the two Mormon brothers is undercover...
1265.56 1267.08 SPEAKER_04  The twink Mormon and the hunk Mormon.
1267.08 1268.92 SPEAKER_04  The twink Mormon who looks a bit like Brandon Flowers.
1268.92 1269.32 SPEAKER_00  That's him.
1269.32 1274.28 SPEAKER_04  Like a young Brandon Flowers is, um, I mean, maybe just all young Mormons look like that, I don't know.
1274.28 1287.56 SPEAKER_04  Um, but like, he's undercover in the factory in Mexico that makes the dice that are then shipped under guard all the way to the casino where they're then tested and put into use and stuff.
1287.56 1287.96 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1287.96 1295.80 SPEAKER_04  Um, in order to, like, lean into this disguise, he does have a kind of, like, very wide handlebar mustache.
1295.80 1296.20 SPEAKER_04  Yes.
1296.20 1298.04 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, he's got the Zapatista mustache.
1298.04 1298.52 SPEAKER_04  Yes.
1298.52 1299.56 SPEAKER_04  Hell yeah.
1299.56 1299.96 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1299.96 1300.12 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1300.12 1305.80 SPEAKER_04  It's, it's maybe, like, offensive, since he's playing Mexican, but...
1305.80 1306.92 SPEAKER_04  Yes.
1306.92 1307.88 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1307.88 1308.04 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1308.04 1310.92 SPEAKER_03  Not a big fan of this, I have to say, but...
1310.92 1315.16 SPEAKER_04  I have strongly mixed feelings about this whole subplot, let me say.
1315.16 1315.24 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1315.24 1317.64 SPEAKER_04  I think it's the most interesting thing about the movie, for better and worse.
1317.64 1318.68 SPEAKER_03  I think it is too, yeah.
1318.68 1324.60 SPEAKER_03  Um, but they've put special chemicals in the dice as they're being made, so they can, like, cause the dice to do whatever they want.
1324.60 1325.08 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1325.08 1330.12 SPEAKER_03  Um, Livingston the electrician is, like, messing with the blackjack shuffling machines.
1330.12 1334.76 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, they get them hired by cheating a polygraph, which polygraphs are bullshit.
1334.76 1342.36 SPEAKER_04  They also then kind of double down on this, because they're like, okay, well, we've also found a second nerd, we've found a second, like, egg.
1342.36 1344.76 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, this kid's only in one scene, who's this kid?
1344.76 1345.88 SPEAKER_04  Eugene.
1345.88 1347.88 SPEAKER_04  Eugene.
1347.88 1353.52 SPEAKER_04  The, like, um, egg-looking computer science student, who they get to program some of the stuff.
1353.52 1354.52 SPEAKER_04  I don't know why this kid...
1354.52 1355.52 SPEAKER_04  The slot machines.
1355.52 1357.52 SPEAKER_04  Maybe he won a contest or something, but like...
1357.52 1359.48 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, is this like a producer's kid or something?
1359.48 1367.48 SPEAKER_05  It's like the Frank Sinatra code, you know, if you're planning a heist, you gotta have, like, some people whose first heist it is so that they can up-skill a little.
1367.48 1368.48 SPEAKER_05  Mm-hmm.
1368.48 1371.08 SPEAKER_05  It's a really nice way that the industry works.
1371.08 1378.28 SPEAKER_04  Also, this movie, much like our podcast, is about having an excuse to dress up with your friends and, like, hang out in outfits.
1378.28 1380.28 SPEAKER_04  That is true, yeah.
1380.28 1384.28 SPEAKER_04  So, they do kind of a rerun of the montage.
1384.28 1393.28 SPEAKER_04  In the first movie, where it's like the three most successful casino robberies, where they try their roulette scam, and their guy gets, like, bodied instantly by security.
1393.28 1403.92 SPEAKER_04  And, like, Clooney and Pitt are watching him, and George Clooney is wearing, like, a turtleneck, a big gold medallion, and a sort of, like, handlebar moustache.
1403.92 1404.92 SPEAKER_04  He is, yeah.
1404.92 1407.92 SPEAKER_04  And the joke here is like, oh, that guy's not very subtle, is he?
1407.92 1408.92 SPEAKER_04  Mm-hmm.
1408.92 1424.80 SPEAKER_04  I mean, first of all, thank you George for the episode art, but second of all, combined with the fact that he went undercover as Miguel Diaz in the last movie, I'm like, there's a lot of these guys that want very badly to be Hispanic, which is kind of funny.
1424.80 1425.80 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1425.80 1430.20 SPEAKER_04  This is, like, the kind of, like, thing that they're all doing in retirement, you know?
1430.20 1434.84 SPEAKER_05  I think it's nice when white boys get into pretending to be a different race.
1434.84 1436.92 SPEAKER_05  It happens over here, but only with, like, the East.
1436.92 1438.92 SPEAKER_05  I don't think it's nice, per se, by the way.
1438.92 1441.92 SPEAKER_05  I think it's noteworthy.
1441.92 1443.92 SPEAKER_05  Uh-huh, sure, yeah.
1443.92 1452.00 SPEAKER_03  Anyway, they've read all of the games in the casino, but the problem is, the casino has this really advanced AI system.
1452.00 1453.00 SPEAKER_03  Yes, it does.
1453.00 1454.00 SPEAKER_03  Yes!
1454.00 1455.00 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, it does.
1455.00 1456.00 SPEAKER_04  I have to drop.
1456.00 1459.68 SPEAKER_04  It's an artificial intelligence security system.
1459.68 1460.68 SPEAKER_04  It doesn't work.
1460.68 1461.68 SPEAKER_04  It does not work at all.
1461.68 1464.92 SPEAKER_04  It just fully hallucinates one in three things it does.
1464.92 1467.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, it's making up games that don't even fucking exist.
1467.92 1468.92 SPEAKER_04  It's delving.
1468.92 1470.92 SPEAKER_04  It's like you're getting kicked out for cheating at Ballotra.
1470.92 1471.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1471.92 1473.92 SPEAKER_04  But yeah, so...
1473.92 1479.92 SPEAKER_04  Basically, what Suzie as this character says is, like, you guys are too old school.
1479.92 1482.92 SPEAKER_04  You're like analog players in a digital world.
1482.92 1483.92 SPEAKER_04  You're washed, right?
1483.92 1494.92 SPEAKER_04  Because they have this AI security system that, like, the Greco, it's called, that tracks everybody's, like, movement and emotions with pinpoint precision.
1494.92 1496.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, it's like the biometrics and shit like that.
1496.92 1497.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1497.92 1500.92 SPEAKER_04  Can't detect George Clooney wearing the handlebar mustache, but that doesn't matter.
1500.92 1502.92 SPEAKER_04  Um, and by the way...
1502.92 1503.92 SPEAKER_03  It can also...
1503.92 1504.92 SPEAKER_03  It can tell if a win is legitimate.
1504.92 1505.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, exactly.
1505.92 1509.92 SPEAKER_03  Because if you rig the game, if you're cheating, then it, like, it can tell that you're lying.
1509.92 1511.92 SPEAKER_03  It's like a lie detector machine.
1511.92 1514.92 SPEAKER_03  Um, and so it knows if you've rigged the game, right?
1514.92 1518.92 SPEAKER_03  So if everybody in the casino suddenly wins, then they're gonna know that something's up.
1518.92 1519.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1519.92 1520.92 SPEAKER_03  And the Greco is...
1520.92 1521.92 SPEAKER_03  That's true.
1521.92 1523.92 SPEAKER_03  It can't be shut off because it's in an impregnable room that locks down.
1523.92 1526.92 SPEAKER_03  If there's a problem, then it locks down the entire room.
1526.92 1527.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, it locks itself down.
1527.92 1528.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1528.92 1530.92 SPEAKER_03  And then it reboots and the reboot cycle is three and a half minutes.
1530.92 1533.92 SPEAKER_03  And they're like, well, okay, I guess that's our, that's our window, right?
1533.92 1535.92 SPEAKER_03  We have to find a way to shut the computer off.
1535.92 1547.92 SPEAKER_04  Susie, Susie as this character knows the guy who, like, develops it and is maintaining it, this Greco guy, which gets a look off of Brad Pitt and gives me this drop.
1547.92 1549.92 SPEAKER_00  Yeah, you've obviously never served time in a British boarding school.
1549.92 1551.92 SPEAKER_04  Which, many, many such cases.
1551.92 1556.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, because the joke is, because that character's called Roman and someone goes, Greco-Roman.
1556.92 1558.92 SPEAKER_05  And it's just like, da da da da da.
1558.92 1562.92 SPEAKER_05  I love to do a two part name bit that just never comes up for like 20 years.
1562.92 1563.92 SPEAKER_04  Never comes up.
1563.92 1564.92 SPEAKER_04  You know?
1564.92 1565.92 SPEAKER_02  Mmhmm.
1565.92 1567.92 SPEAKER_04  You guys are going to love it when you meet December.
1567.92 1571.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, when the punchline to the November thing hits, it's going to be so good.
1571.92 1575.92 SPEAKER_05  There is, yeah, there's a bit here, it's just like, you know, just wait for it, you know?
1575.92 1577.92 SPEAKER_03  Your daughter's going to be called December.
1577.92 1578.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
1578.92 1581.92 SPEAKER_04  And then your second daughter, January.
1581.92 1583.92 SPEAKER_04  My granddaughter, January Jones, yeah.
1583.92 1585.92 SPEAKER_04  Oh, that's fun.
1585.92 1591.92 SPEAKER_03  So the idea is that we're going to fake a natural disaster by wiggling the building with a big wiggler.
1591.92 1592.92 SPEAKER_03  Yes.
1592.92 1599.92 SPEAKER_03  We're going to get a big drill that simulates an earthquake, which is going to cause, A, the Greco to shut down, and then that's also our plan to get out.
1599.92 1604.92 SPEAKER_03  Because the other problem is like, if everybody wins at the casino games, they also have to then leave the building with the money.
1604.92 1615.92 SPEAKER_03  And so the plan is, okay, we put the building on the wiggler, which shuts the computer down, we have three and a half minutes to make everybody win every game in the casino, and then we hit them with the wiggler again, and that causes them to evacuate.
1615.92 1617.92 SPEAKER_03  And then I have to evacuate, yeah.
1617.92 1621.92 SPEAKER_04  So at this point Don Cheadle has to be in the tunnel boring machine.
1621.92 1625.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, they send him to the tunnel machine jail for the whole rest of the movie.
1625.92 1628.92 SPEAKER_05  It is more or less explicit that he is gooning in there, which...
1628.92 1629.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, yeah.
1629.92 1632.92 SPEAKER_03  He asks Matt Damon to buy him porn mags, and Matt Damon won't do it.
1632.92 1633.92 SPEAKER_03  Mm-hmm.
1633.92 1634.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, he won't do it.
1634.92 1635.92 SPEAKER_03  He's too woke.
1635.92 1636.92 SPEAKER_04  He's too woke.
1636.92 1637.92 SPEAKER_04  He won't do it.
1637.92 1645.92 SPEAKER_04  I don't know, I think this is just like objectifying, you know, and this is like 2010's porn mags as well, so like, sort of at the end of the lads mag era.
1645.92 1646.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, really bad.
1646.92 1661.92 SPEAKER_05  There's a scene where Linus is in London, very briefly, I don't quite recall what he's there to do, but it has this blue filter over it that's like Tuva de Grieve at the yellow filter for Mexico in Spectre, and it's so funny to see us getting hit by that.
1661.92 1663.92 SPEAKER_04  Do you know why he has a scene in London?
1663.92 1666.92 SPEAKER_04  Not like why in the movie, but why in...
1666.92 1668.92 SPEAKER_05  I don't even remember because he was in London for Jason Bourne's material.
1668.92 1669.92 SPEAKER_04  Yes!
1669.92 1670.92 SPEAKER_04  Yes!
1670.92 1677.92 SPEAKER_04  And they didn't manage to get him off the set of the Jason Bourne where that Guardian journalist gets killed, so he's just like...
1677.92 1678.92 SPEAKER_04  Oh, the bin man.
1678.92 1681.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, he's taking a break from the bin man takes to do like...
1681.92 1682.92 SPEAKER_04  Oh, that's so funny.
1682.92 1688.92 SPEAKER_04  ...a bit like into a phone where he's like, yeah, I'm in like Cody Banks drop London.
1688.92 1689.92 SPEAKER_04  Hmm.
1689.92 1696.92 SPEAKER_05  That's why I found this out after the episode, that's why Bernie Mac wasn't really in the last one, is because he was filming the Bernie Mac show the whole time.
1696.92 1697.92 SPEAKER_03  I'm kind of insulted.
1697.92 1699.92 SPEAKER_03  What's his excuse for not being in this one?
1699.92 1700.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah!
1700.92 1703.92 SPEAKER_05  He probably was still filming the Bernie Mac show, I don't know how long that went.
1703.92 1709.92 SPEAKER_04  I feel kind of insulted that this movie is like so obviously extracurricular for these guys.
1709.92 1710.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, right?
1710.92 1711.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah!
1711.92 1712.92 SPEAKER_04  Like this isn't even the main thing you've got on.
1712.92 1713.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah!
1713.92 1718.92 SPEAKER_04  Like this is the kind of filler in your schedule and I paid full price to see this.
1718.92 1722.92 SPEAKER_03  And it was more that the second one was one of the most profitable movies of the year it came out too.
1722.92 1728.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, it's like the 10th best selling movie of 2001 and you're just like, don't give a shit.
1728.92 1733.92 SPEAKER_05  I will say that does make it much more obvious the ones for whom this is like the main thing that they have going on.
1733.92 1734.92 SPEAKER_05  Soul!
1734.92 1739.92 SPEAKER_05  Like, Soul, yeah, Soul, the Mormon brothers are really bringing it.
1739.92 1740.92 SPEAKER_05  Oh yeah.
1740.92 1742.92 SPEAKER_05  I gotta say, it's gotta be great to be those guys.
1742.92 1749.92 SPEAKER_05  Like every time George Clooney wants a multi-million dollar check in the mid-2000s, you get one too, just like you've been grandfathered in.
1749.92 1751.92 SPEAKER_05  You probably don't get paid the same amount.
1751.92 1754.92 SPEAKER_05  I imagine you probably get paid for being in the movie though.
1754.92 1757.92 SPEAKER_04  You get paid something and you're like SAG-AFTRA.
1757.92 1762.92 SPEAKER_04  I'm like grabbing a hammer and nails and I'm going into George Clooney's coattails at that point.
1762.92 1763.92 SPEAKER_04  Oh, fully.
1763.92 1769.92 SPEAKER_04  I've got like climbing spikes in the back of his thighs, I'm like just on there, you know?
1769.92 1770.92 SPEAKER_04  Take me with you.
1770.92 1774.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, you're just like, I want the Lake Comer house, George, just give me the coomper.
1774.92 1775.92 SPEAKER_03  I want a little lake com.
1775.92 1777.92 SPEAKER_03  I'll take a smaller lake, George.
1777.92 1784.92 SPEAKER_04  Those two Mormon guys, probably not even Mormon in real life, are like parasiting George Clooney's house on Lake Comer right now.
1784.92 1790.92 SPEAKER_04  He's out in Paris filming Nespresso commercials and they're ordering like fried chicken and wings.
1790.92 1792.92 SPEAKER_03  He's gonna need someone to house it!
1792.92 1797.92 SPEAKER_05  PC Affleck and Scott Kahn are in your basement right now, George Clooney.
1797.92 1800.92 SPEAKER_04  I'm doing the like parasite like air quotes thing.
1800.92 1802.92 SPEAKER_04  Casey Affleck, Boston, right?
1802.92 1804.92 SPEAKER_04  But so- only child.
1804.92 1809.92 SPEAKER_03  The other aspect of the plan is that they want the hotel to get a bad review.
1809.92 1812.92 SPEAKER_03  So they identify who the reviewer is gonna be.
1812.92 1816.92 SPEAKER_03  They sabotage basically pretty much everything this poor fucking guy does.
1816.92 1825.92 SPEAKER_03  And then Saul poses as a reviewer so that Cameron Diaz brackets Ellen Barkin question mark is gonna give him the VIP treatment.
1825.92 1827.92 SPEAKER_03  Saul's character here.
1827.92 1834.92 SPEAKER_04  The square brackets British accent is being stretched to its fucking limits across this franchise.
1834.92 1838.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, it was bad enough with Don Cheadle but like do we have to do this?
1838.92 1841.92 SPEAKER_03  We're getting it from both directions on this fucking movie.
1841.92 1842.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, come on!
1842.92 1848.92 SPEAKER_04  And this guy's, his like cover name, his fake name is like Kensington Chubb.
1848.92 1850.92 SPEAKER_04  Which is- Yes, I also wrote this down.
1850.92 1854.92 SPEAKER_04  Walking into the venue, hello my name is Safe McCracken.
1854.92 1855.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
1855.92 1861.92 SPEAKER_05  It's so- his whole character in this is just like heavily dropping hints that I'm the hotel reviewer.
1861.92 1863.92 SPEAKER_05  Like just walking around me.
1863.92 1864.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
1864.92 1869.92 SPEAKER_05  Wow, if I was to review this hotel it wouldn't do too good right now and all the staff are like, oh shit, give this guy a room now.
1869.92 1876.92 SPEAKER_04  He literally drops a binder that has the logo of the fucking like Michelin, you know, analog on that.
1876.92 1877.92 SPEAKER_04  Five diamond thing, yeah.
1877.92 1878.92 SPEAKER_04  Mm-hmm.
1878.92 1882.92 SPEAKER_03  And meanwhile they've paid one of the concierge off to fuck with this guy.
1882.92 1889.92 SPEAKER_03  It's really interesting, so we kind of get a hand wave line where they talk about how they bribed one of the concierge to fuck with the real reviewer.
1889.92 1890.92 SPEAKER_03  Mm-hmm.
1890.92 1896.92 SPEAKER_03  And Brad Pitt says, oh, she's very ambitious, I offered her like a hotel manager gig in Monaco.
1896.92 1902.92 SPEAKER_03  And I'm like, how do you- you're a criminal, how do you- He's a hotels guy.
1902.92 1903.92 SPEAKER_03  He's just saying shit, yeah.
1903.92 1905.92 SPEAKER_04  He's just like become a real like player in the space.
1905.92 1913.92 SPEAKER_04  Meanwhile, in Mexico, the twink Mormon is getting like- is getting radicalized.
1913.92 1914.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, no.
1914.92 1915.92 SPEAKER_05  He is radicalizing them.
1915.92 1916.92 SPEAKER_05  I love this.
1916.92 1917.92 SPEAKER_05  He's radicalizing them.
1917.92 1925.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, he is a union agitator at this point because like he observes that the conditions are very, very bad.
1925.92 1934.92 SPEAKER_04  And all of the actual Mexicans in this workplace are like, yeah, no, it fucking sucks, but like this is like labor conditions in Mexico.
1934.92 1935.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, yeah.
1935.92 1949.92 SPEAKER_04  And he, as we see as the punchline of the scene, riffing off of a poster for tequila that invokes the name Zapata is like, you've forgotten Senor General Emiliano Zapata.
1949.92 1954.92 SPEAKER_04  It's like, you know, stand on your feet rather than live on your knees, right?
1954.92 1955.92 SPEAKER_04  Mm-hmm.
1955.92 1957.92 SPEAKER_04  This is really funny, right?
1957.92 1960.92 SPEAKER_04  If you imagine, because he is actually radicalizing them.
1960.92 1969.92 SPEAKER_04  And if you think of this as like, this is the small domino and the big domino is like the Mexican army reconquering California in 2060, this is-
1969.92 1972.92 SPEAKER_05  Mm-hmm. 2060 is a long time off, pal.
1972.92 1973.92 SPEAKER_05  It's a lot of dominoes.
1973.92 1974.92 SPEAKER_05  Mid 2020 is easy.
1974.92 1976.92 SPEAKER_04  It's a lot of dominoes, you know?
1976.92 1979.92 SPEAKER_05  Oh no, I just think that they'll conquer California faster than that.
1979.92 1980.92 SPEAKER_05  I mean, inshallah.
1980.92 1982.92 SPEAKER_03  That would just be- that would be just my luck, wouldn't it?
1982.92 1988.92 SPEAKER_03  To move to LA, to like go to Hollywood just in time for it to be fucking invaded.
1988.92 1989.92 SPEAKER_03  Start learning Spanish.
1989.92 1990.92 SPEAKER_05  It's probably better.
1990.92 1991.92 SPEAKER_05  You know?
1991.92 1993.92 SPEAKER_05  It's not like they're going to get anything out of the Republican government.
1993.92 1994.92 SPEAKER_05  No.
1994.92 1996.92 SPEAKER_05  They'll probably get it out of Claudia Scheinbaum's government.
1996.92 1997.92 SPEAKER_03  Actually, yeah, fair enough, yeah.
1997.92 1999.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, long live Commander Scheinbaum.
1999.92 2000.92 SPEAKER_05  Viva la Revolución!
2000.92 2005.92 SPEAKER_05  I will serve in any land war against the criminal America current empire.
2005.92 2015.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, just the bit where all of us join the Mexican army, it's just like, in the 19th century, we become like the San Pedroesios.
2015.92 2017.92 SPEAKER_03  We'll keep podcasting from the front.
2017.92 2018.92 None  Yeah!
2018.92 2021.92 SPEAKER_03  We just killed James Bond en Español.
2021.92 2031.92 SPEAKER_04  Just like, it's one of those weird points of Mexican military history where some like, you know, non-Mexicans who are too woke come over and get killed in your favour.
2031.92 2036.92 SPEAKER_04  It's just like a trans battalion that gets wiped out south of Los Angeles.
2036.92 2037.92 SPEAKER_03  Hell yeah!
2037.92 2038.92 SPEAKER_04  Beautiful.
2038.92 2039.92 SPEAKER_04  Fuck yeah.
2039.92 2040.92 SPEAKER_04  That's what Escape from LA is about.
2040.92 2042.92 SPEAKER_05  I don't quite recall.
2042.92 2053.92 SPEAKER_05  So the point of this, by the way, the unionisation effort here is like, on purpose, because since these guys produce the dice, they want to make sure that they're like low on dice reserves.
2053.92 2058.92 SPEAKER_05  So that the ones that they specifically spike are guaranteed to be used on opening night.
2058.92 2061.92 SPEAKER_05  So they're like disrupting the supply chain.
2061.92 2062.92 SPEAKER_05  Hmm.
2062.92 2066.92 SPEAKER_05  It took me too long to figure out that that was what was going on.
2066.92 2068.92 SPEAKER_05  I was like, what the fuck's going on down there?
2068.92 2070.92 SPEAKER_05  Is it? I thought this was an accident.
2070.92 2075.92 SPEAKER_04  I thought he just like authentically like became into, into like labour relations.
2075.92 2076.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2076.92 2078.92 SPEAKER_03  I thought that was the joke because they sent-
2078.92 2079.92 SPEAKER_04  Me too for the whole movie, yeah.
2079.92 2087.92 SPEAKER_03  Later on, they sent his elder brother down because the factory's on strike and they're like, shit, we don't have the special dice that we need. And they sent his elder brother down to sort him out, to sort him out.
2087.92 2090.92 SPEAKER_03  And then the joke is that they cut to his elder brother, like, have you sorted things out?
2090.92 2091.92 SPEAKER_03  And he's like, yeah, it's all fine.
2091.92 2093.92 SPEAKER_03  We just need management to get back to us.
2093.92 2095.92 SPEAKER_03  And he's like throwing molotovs at the police.
2095.92 2100.92 SPEAKER_04  The line is, we just need to break management, which is even better.
2100.92 2101.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2101.92 2102.92 SPEAKER_05  Cool.
2102.92 2103.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, do this.
2103.92 2111.92 SPEAKER_04  I kind of like this, especially because in that conversation, when they're talking about it, like-
2111.92 2115.92 SPEAKER_00  So he says they want their bread and they want the roses too.
2115.92 2125.92 SPEAKER_04  Just authentically becoming like too deep cover and becoming like a communist agitator. I mean, this is historically not a great occupation in Mexico.
2125.92 2132.92 SPEAKER_04  Like the fucking like Mormon brothers are going to turn up like, you know, shot in a ditch by the Federalists, but like, it's- They're having a great time.
2132.92 2134.92 SPEAKER_04  Oh yeah, they're enjoying it.
2134.92 2140.92 SPEAKER_04  They're like genuinely building solidarity between- Yeah.
2140.92 2144.92 SPEAKER_04  Particularly like Mexican, like working class things.
2144.92 2150.92 SPEAKER_04  Because as they're leaving with the dice, one of them is like, you know, like tell my brother to hang tough.
2150.92 2154.92 SPEAKER_04  And then we see that brother, who is the same actor, of course, in like the casino.
2154.92 2158.92 SPEAKER_04  And it's like, okay, so we're actually like, you know, punching through the floor here.
2158.92 2164.92 SPEAKER_04  The joke that I had written for this is, this is the best time a Mormon has had in Mexico since Mitt Romney's father.
2164.92 2167.92 SPEAKER_04  Uh, just Google it, then you get around it.
2167.92 2168.92 SPEAKER_03  Um.
2168.92 2174.92 SPEAKER_03  Anyway, the other hitch in the plan, um, is that the drill, the big drill they're using to dig the hyperloop and wiggle the building.
2174.92 2175.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, yeah.
2175.92 2180.92 SPEAKER_03  Is broken and they need to buy another one, which is gonna cost 36 million dollars.
2180.92 2181.92 SPEAKER_03  Oh yeah.
2181.92 2183.92 SPEAKER_03  And they're like, fuck, where are we gonna get that?
2183.92 2184.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2184.92 2185.92 SPEAKER_04  You know who was in the other two movies?
2185.92 2186.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2186.92 2191.92 SPEAKER_04  You know who they were beaten and therefore is now their friend by Dragon Ball rules?
2191.92 2193.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, yeah, yeah, like fucking casino Goku.
2193.92 2194.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, absolutely.
2194.92 2198.92 SPEAKER_05  Look, we gotta make up this 13 somehow, alright?
2198.92 2201.92 SPEAKER_03  We're up to like 17 at this point, but whatever.
2201.92 2203.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, I know who all of these people are.
2203.92 2208.92 SPEAKER_04  It's true, fucking Vincent Vassal Cassell has been like, following them around the casino this whole time.
2208.92 2210.92 SPEAKER_04  And you're like, that's the guy from the last movie.
2210.92 2211.92 SPEAKER_04  The Night Fox is here.
2211.92 2212.92 SPEAKER_03  The Night Fox.
2212.92 2213.92 SPEAKER_04  He is here, yeah.
2213.92 2215.92 SPEAKER_04  He doesn't even do the fox thing anymore, it's bullshit.
2215.92 2216.92 SPEAKER_04  It's bullshit.
2216.92 2217.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, I know.
2217.92 2224.92 SPEAKER_03  We gotta go to Casino Dracula, Andy Garcia, and ask him for a loan to buy the Big Wiggler.
2224.92 2228.92 SPEAKER_04  Andy Garcia later in this movie will make the funniest noise.
2228.92 2231.92 SPEAKER_04  So just look forward to that one, you know?
2231.92 2232.92 SPEAKER_04  Oh hell yeah.
2232.92 2236.92 SPEAKER_03  And he's like, okay, I hate Al Pacino, so I will lend you the money to buy this drill.
2236.92 2240.92 SPEAKER_03  But I want you to steal his diamonds.
2240.92 2244.92 SPEAKER_03  Which weren't originally part of the plan, because the diamonds are in like a super secure room.
2244.92 2247.92 SPEAKER_03  He has these diamond necklaces that he gets awarded for winning the five diamonds.
2247.92 2249.92 SPEAKER_03  He's like, I hate him so much.
2249.92 2250.92 SPEAKER_03  Steal the diamonds.
2250.92 2252.92 SPEAKER_03  I don't get- you can keep them if you want to.
2252.92 2254.92 SPEAKER_03  But I just want him to fucking lose everything.
2254.92 2258.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, and he's having a great time being a kind of like mobbed up piece of shit in this movie.
2258.92 2260.92 SPEAKER_04  It's kind of- he's really enjoying it.
2260.92 2262.92 SPEAKER_04  And so am I, to be honest.
2262.92 2274.92 SPEAKER_04  So the angle here, the scam, the way they're gonna do this, involves- We recall Yen, the like tiny Chinese acrobat who only gets to speak Mandarin in profanity?
2274.92 2275.92 SPEAKER_04  Yes.
2275.92 2279.92 SPEAKER_05  Half- like a couple of my notes here are just please translate the Mandarin, I'm begging you.
2279.92 2281.92 SPEAKER_04  But- Yes.
2281.92 2282.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2282.92 2285.92 SPEAKER_04  He's gonna be a whale, like a big time rich gambler.
2285.92 2295.92 SPEAKER_04  And Matt Damon wearing a large like Serrano de Bergerac style prosthetic nose is going to be his like translator.
2295.92 2296.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2296.92 2298.92 SPEAKER_04  And they're gonna recognize him.
2298.92 2303.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, and that's how they're gonna- Because you can access the diamond room through the vents from the super high rollers villa.
2303.92 2306.92 SPEAKER_03  And so they meet- To be fair, right, to Cameron Diaz.
2306.92 2307.92 SPEAKER_04  Is this the same again?
2307.92 2308.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, Ellen Barkin.
2308.92 2309.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, Ellen Barkin.
2309.92 2312.92 SPEAKER_04  When they meet Cameron Diaz, she immediately calls the cops.
2312.92 2313.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2313.92 2315.92 SPEAKER_05  Straight away, and that is smart, yeah.
2315.92 2317.92 SPEAKER_05  Like instantly hits up the FBI about this.
2317.92 2318.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2318.92 2330.92 SPEAKER_03  Um, so they meet her at the airport, um, and like Matt Damon is posing as his communicator, uh, and then, uh, he's like, oh, Mr. Wang owns all the air south of Beijing.
2330.92 2331.92 SPEAKER_03  It's like, okay.
2331.92 2332.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2332.92 2333.92 SPEAKER_03  Whatever.
2333.92 2334.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2334.92 2338.92 SPEAKER_03  The room with the diamonds in is so fucking difficult to access.
2338.92 2339.92 SPEAKER_03  It's like impossible to get into.
2339.92 2344.92 SPEAKER_03  There's one elevator, but like the only people who have access are Al Pacino and Ellen Barkin.
2344.92 2348.92 SPEAKER_03  Um, so they have to like bribe or threaten- Oh yeah, they threaten a guard!
2348.92 2349.92 SPEAKER_03  That's it!
2349.92 2351.92 SPEAKER_03  They say- Cause one of the-
2351.92 2353.92 SPEAKER_04  Wait, wait, wait, wait, you're way out of sequence. You're way out of sequence.
2353.92 2354.92 SPEAKER_05  Whoa, shit.
2354.92 2355.92 SPEAKER_05  To be fair, we've missed a couple of things.
2355.92 2357.92 SPEAKER_04  There's like 50 things in this movie.
2357.92 2360.92 SPEAKER_04  So like, first thing they do is, Yen has to do some acrobatics, right?
2360.92 2361.92 SPEAKER_04  Oh yeah.
2361.92 2366.92 SPEAKER_04  They kind of like emotionally blackmail him into climbing up the lift shaft.
2366.92 2371.92 SPEAKER_04  Mercifully, uh, like, elevators lifts are very easy to CGI because they're just like cubes.
2371.92 2376.92 SPEAKER_04  So we get some pretty convincing for the time thing of like elevators like shooting past the guy.
2376.92 2378.92 SPEAKER_04  Um, as they do all of the setup for this.
2378.92 2383.92 SPEAKER_04  We get, uh, fucking, uh, Brad Pitt goes undercover as a seismologist.
2383.92 2385.92 SPEAKER_04  Yes, this is something that we need to get up to.
2385.92 2386.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
2386.92 2393.92 SPEAKER_05  Because of the tunnel thing, they need to get in there and be like, you need to have an evacuation plan in case of earthquake.
2393.92 2396.92 SPEAKER_05  Here is a big seismograph for you to keep in your office.
2396.92 2400.92 SPEAKER_05  And it's just like a huge, like camcorder with seismograph written on the side.
2400.92 2402.92 SPEAKER_05  Please point this at you the whole time.
2402.92 2413.92 SPEAKER_04  Two other facts that are related to Susie Izzet at one point goes, oh, I don't know how you could shut down the fucking like grok or whatever unless you could walk a magnetron into that room.
2413.92 2419.92 SPEAKER_04  Second thing, Al Pacino being like, I need the new top of the line Samsung phone.
2419.92 2420.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2420.92 2422.92 SPEAKER_04  I want the new Samsung Note 5.
2422.92 2423.92 SPEAKER_04  I want that shit.
2423.92 2429.92 SPEAKER_04  They made, they made one of one like ultra tier Samsung phones for this, for this movie.
2429.92 2430.92 SPEAKER_04  Really?
2430.92 2431.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2431.92 2432.92 SPEAKER_04  It's cool.
2432.92 2433.92 SPEAKER_03  It's like gold plated with diamonds.
2433.92 2434.92 SPEAKER_03  It looks awful.
2434.92 2435.92 SPEAKER_03  It looks like shit.
2435.92 2436.92 SPEAKER_05  Very snugg.
2436.92 2444.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, but you get a big scene of him being like, oh, you gotta get me this phone, and his assistant Cameron Barkin is just like, I can't get you the phone.
2444.92 2446.92 SPEAKER_05  I can't get you the phone.
2446.92 2451.92 SPEAKER_05  And the payoff later on is that they give her a fake phone that's a seismograph or whatever.
2451.92 2452.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, it's got a magnetron.
2452.92 2453.92 SPEAKER_04  It's a magnetron.
2453.92 2474.92 SPEAKER_04  The other thing here is that we check in on Ruben, who is like, non-responsive, he's like catatonic, I don't know whether we're meant to assume this is like a cardiogenic stroke or whatever the fuck, but like, Basher is writing him like these long heartfelt letters that he's not able to read, and we get Clair de Lune in a minor key, right?
2474.92 2478.92 SPEAKER_00  Now that time of day I have set apart for Debussy.
2478.92 2491.92 SPEAKER_04  Because, if you remember, the first movie ended with all of these fuckers outside the fountain of the Bellagio while they're playing Clair de Lune, and so that's the play in your leitmotif in a minor key, you know?
2491.92 2492.92 SPEAKER_05  Oh no!
2492.92 2493.92 SPEAKER_04  To show that you're fucked up.
2493.92 2494.92 SPEAKER_05  Oh no, we hate!
2494.92 2495.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
2495.92 2499.92 SPEAKER_05  If they play my leitmotif in a minor key, I am leaving the situation.
2499.92 2500.92 SPEAKER_05  I don't care what's happening.
2500.92 2506.92 SPEAKER_04  We've got a theme, like if someone wants to like, transpose that into a minor key, then you know...
2506.92 2509.92 SPEAKER_03  We should just have that on deck for when one of us dies?
2509.92 2510.92 SPEAKER_03  In loving memory.
2510.92 2515.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, we should get the guy who made this for us to begin with just like, do sad versions.
2515.92 2519.92 SPEAKER_04  Just like, you know, it's so sad that Devon died.
2519.92 2524.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, but it's all like, Viola or whatever.
2524.92 2533.92 SPEAKER_03  Do we have a plan for what happens to the podcast if one of us dies?
2533.92 2536.92 SPEAKER_04  I mean, I would like to be replaced, right?
2536.92 2543.92 SPEAKER_04  I would want you to keep going, possibly get a couple of people and call it like Kill James Bond, like, two or four, whatever.
2543.92 2544.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, yeah.
2544.92 2545.92 SPEAKER_04  After the spirit of this.
2545.92 2551.92 SPEAKER_04  No, no, no, like genuinely, I would, I think any of the podcasts that I do, I would like to be replaced seamlessly.
2551.92 2552.92 SPEAKER_04  You know?
2552.92 2553.92 SPEAKER_04  Like, I...
2553.92 2554.92 SPEAKER_04  I just don't think that's possible.
2554.92 2556.92 SPEAKER_04  I want you to replace me with Daniel Craig.
2556.92 2557.92 SPEAKER_03  Okay, sure.
2557.92 2558.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, we'll get in contact.
2558.92 2559.92 SPEAKER_05  I think that would be quite funny.
2559.92 2560.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, and then we'll force Femma afterwards.
2560.92 2561.92 SPEAKER_03  We can do this.
2561.92 2566.92 SPEAKER_05  We can really, if the word force is like even justified there, you know?
2566.92 2568.92 SPEAKER_05  Well, it's only force Femme because she's a butch, obviously.
2568.92 2574.92 SPEAKER_05  Like, kind of like coaxing a woodland animal, you know?
2574.92 2579.92 SPEAKER_04  What the fuck else happens in this movie?
2579.92 2589.92 SPEAKER_03  So the one guard of the diamond room, Brad Pitt has this line, because we've got to get this one guard out of the way, and Brad Pitt has this line where he says...
2589.92 2590.92 SPEAKER_03  Oh, I have the line.
2590.92 2591.92 SPEAKER_01  I have the line.
2591.92 2592.92 SPEAKER_01  Okay.
2592.92 2593.92 SPEAKER_01  Fucking...
2593.92 2597.92 SPEAKER_01  Okay, the guard by the main elevator shaft has a little Hitler for a son.
2597.92 2598.92 SPEAKER_01  A real Ritalin sniffer.
2598.92 2599.92 SPEAKER_01  A real one-same punch there.
2599.92 2600.92 SPEAKER_04  A real Hitler for a son.
2600.92 2604.92 SPEAKER_04  First of all, this guy's son is Hitler.
2604.92 2611.92 SPEAKER_04  Second thing, he sniffs Ritalin, which is not as far as I know how you take it, but like, fine.
2611.92 2619.92 SPEAKER_04  So we see this guard, fucking Alois Hitler, or whatever, at his post, John Hitler.
2619.92 2623.92 SPEAKER_04  Ahead of Ron Hitler, of the Las Vegas Hitlers.
2623.92 2629.92 SPEAKER_03  You shook Hitler's hand, and there's a code amongst guys who shook Hitler's hand!
2629.92 2631.92 SPEAKER_04  I guess that kind of literally was, was the problem.
2631.92 2632.92 SPEAKER_04  It was very bad.
2632.92 2633.92 SPEAKER_04  If so.
2633.92 2639.92 SPEAKER_04  But there's like so many plates spinning here, my notes are completely disjointed.
2639.92 2642.92 SPEAKER_04  I, I, I, just some miscellanea here.
2642.92 2648.92 SPEAKER_04  I've also got that when, when they go to see Andy Garcia about this, he is wearing what I describe as a, a pimp lab coat.
2648.92 2649.92 SPEAKER_04  Um, he is.
2649.92 2650.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2650.92 2662.92 SPEAKER_03  So they, they call this guard, George Clooney calls the guard and pretends to be the vice principal of the school, he's like, your kid's in trouble, he bit a lunch lady, and so the guy has to run out, and uh, and so Brad Pitt is like covering his shift now.
2662.92 2668.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, Brad Pitt just happens to be walking past him at the time, so he's like, oh, can you please cover my shift for like 20 minutes, you're gonna really help me out?
2668.92 2669.92 SPEAKER_05  My son bit a teacher again.
2669.92 2670.92 SPEAKER_05  Whatever.
2670.92 2671.92 SPEAKER_04  Because there's like, lots of shots of like...
2671.92 2672.92 SPEAKER_04  My son Hitler.
2672.92 2673.92 SPEAKER_04  Clooney, my son Adolf.
2673.92 2687.92 SPEAKER_04  Uh, because there's lots of shots of Clooney and Pitt hanging out, there's one of them in like a mountain warehouse, putting on big, big jackets, and Vassar Cassell is there, and it's just very funny to like, that's a location to put this man in, you know?
2687.92 2690.92 SPEAKER_04  You can't take this man to Target, you know?
2690.92 2693.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, he's too French to be in a hometown.
2693.92 2696.92 SPEAKER_04  Mountie in the warehouse, you know?
2696.92 2701.92 SPEAKER_03  Well, mine are saying nobody will be seated during the thrilling George Clooney and Brad Pitt watch Oprah scene.
2701.92 2704.92 SPEAKER_03  They cry, they get in touch with their feelings.
2704.92 2705.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, they do, they cry at Oprah.
2705.92 2706.92 SPEAKER_03  What the fuck is this?
2706.92 2707.92 SPEAKER_03  I don't know.
2707.92 2721.92 SPEAKER_04  This is what it means when people say there's no like, positive masculine role models anymore, this is what the last serious attempt looked like, and it was like, two extremely handsome men being like, you should watch Oprah, I guess.
2721.92 2722.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2722.92 2724.92 SPEAKER_03  They watch Oprah for five minutes and cry.
2724.92 2735.92 SPEAKER_05  Brad Pitt like, drops in on George Clooney, and he just like, happens to be watching Oprah at the time, and they both get like, caught up watching it, and they tear up at like, a kid being given something.
2735.92 2739.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, you had to pay tax on all that shit that you want on Oprah, like you...
2739.92 2748.92 SPEAKER_05  I think this is correctly assuming that the vast majority of the Ocean's 13 and indeed the Vegas fandom are divorced men.
2748.92 2752.92 SPEAKER_05  So like, just being like, wow, a kid being happy, isn't that cool?
2752.92 2757.92 SPEAKER_05  And like, I think it's an attempt to like, humanize them in their eyes, but I don't know.
2757.92 2758.92 SPEAKER_05  I really don't know.
2758.92 2766.92 SPEAKER_04  I describe this couple as baby girl multiple times across my notes here, because they do just be hanging out, right?
2766.92 2767.92 SPEAKER_04  Like you could do...
2767.92 2768.92 SPEAKER_04  You know the...
2768.92 2770.92 SPEAKER_04  You remember the Serpico fan cam, right?
2770.92 2774.92 SPEAKER_04  You could do a vast amount of that for this.
2774.92 2775.92 SPEAKER_04  Like...
2775.92 2776.92 SPEAKER_04  Yes.
2776.92 2780.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, the Danny Ocean ex-Rusty Ryan fan cam actually would be...
2780.92 2781.92 SPEAKER_05  Oh yeah.
2781.92 2790.92 SPEAKER_04  I watched this movie and I genuinely was like, there's gotta be so much like AO3, like fan fiction, of these two like, fucking each other.
2790.92 2793.92 SPEAKER_04  Because like, they lean into it pretty heavily in this one.
2793.92 2800.92 SPEAKER_04  They're like, this is what people want, this is what people wanna see, and this is the movie that we want to make, is one where the only time...
2800.92 2801.92 SPEAKER_04  Like, women?
2801.92 2802.92 SPEAKER_04  Out of the picture, right?
2802.92 2803.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2803.92 2804.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2804.92 2806.92 SPEAKER_04  Pure homosociality, and particularly these two.
2806.92 2810.92 SPEAKER_04  And any time they're on screen together, it's like, it's that relationship.
2810.92 2814.92 SPEAKER_03  Stole the Fabergé egg, but it also stole my heart.
2814.92 2815.92 SPEAKER_04  Mmm.
2815.92 2816.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2816.92 2817.92 SPEAKER_04  Really stole that one.
2817.92 2819.92 SPEAKER_03  Thank you, thank you so much.
2819.92 2820.92 SPEAKER_03  Professional writer.
2820.92 2826.92 SPEAKER_03  So, we've still got this problem of we can't get in the fucking diamond room, because it's too impregnable.
2826.92 2830.92 SPEAKER_03  And so they say to Casino Dracula, they're like, do we have to steal the diamonds?
2830.92 2831.92 SPEAKER_03  What if we don't steal the diamonds?
2831.92 2834.92 SPEAKER_03  And he has this fun line where he says, do you have all your affairs in order?
2834.92 2835.92 SPEAKER_03  Which I think is quite a fun thing.
2835.92 2840.92 SPEAKER_05  I found 319 Danny Ocean ex-Rusty Ryan things on our account.
2840.92 2841.92 SPEAKER_05  Wow.
2841.92 2842.92 SPEAKER_04  That's way too low.
2842.92 2843.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
2843.92 2844.92 SPEAKER_05  It should be more.
2844.92 2845.92 SPEAKER_05  Get those numbers up.
2845.92 2846.92 SPEAKER_05  Get those numbers up now.
2846.92 2850.92 SPEAKER_05  Well, it's the most popular ship, well in advance of Danny Ocean slash Tess Ocean, for which there are only 44.
2850.92 2851.92 SPEAKER_05  Of course it is.
2851.92 2852.92 SPEAKER_05  She's barely in the film.
2852.92 2854.92 SPEAKER_05  Who's writing a fanfic about a cannon fucking ship?
2854.92 2855.92 SPEAKER_05  What are we doing here?
2855.92 2856.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
2856.92 2857.92 SPEAKER_05  It's disgraceful.
2857.92 2859.92 SPEAKER_05  Linus Caldwell slash Danny Ocean slash Rusty Ryan.
2859.92 2860.92 SPEAKER_05  Oh my God.
2860.92 2861.92 SPEAKER_04  Okay.
2861.92 2862.92 SPEAKER_05  Ten of them?
2862.92 2863.92 SPEAKER_05  I gotta close this up.
2863.92 2870.92 SPEAKER_04  So we get the Steven Soderbergh like split screen thing a bunch of times, because they're doing the like soft opening of the casino.
2870.92 2871.92 SPEAKER_03  Not yet.
2871.92 2872.92 SPEAKER_03  Fuck.
2872.92 2875.92 SPEAKER_03  Because Matt Damon is like, I know how I can get into the diamond room.
2875.92 2878.92 SPEAKER_03  Which is by seducing- Oh yeah, this is a great scene.
2878.92 2879.92 SPEAKER_05  Alan Barkin, who is not Cameron Diaz.
2879.92 2880.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
2880.92 2881.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2881.92 2882.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2882.92 2883.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2883.92 2884.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
2884.92 2885.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2885.92 2886.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2886.92 2889.92 SPEAKER_04  And he's like, you know, this is, they have a conversation every time he's on screen about the fucking nose, right?
2889.92 2891.92 SPEAKER_04  The recurring joke is the nose plays.
2891.92 2894.92 SPEAKER_04  He's not just a, it's not just a prop for prop's sake.
2894.92 2895.92 SPEAKER_04  He's doing something with the nose.
2895.92 2896.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
2896.92 2897.92 SPEAKER_04  He thinks that the nose is like hot.
2897.92 2898.92 SPEAKER_03  Like an artistic decision, right?
2898.92 2903.92 SPEAKER_04  Um, it's, it's, I mean, it's a joke about acting and the movie with actors.
2903.92 2904.92 SPEAKER_04  Um, the-
2904.92 2911.92 SPEAKER_03  And Matt Damon's like, I can, I can seduce her and get inside the diamond room. Um, and they say give him an accelerator?
2911.92 2915.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, they have to pretend that Matt Damon doesn't look like Matt Damon.
2915.92 2918.92 SPEAKER_04  So they're like, oh, alright, well, I guess-
2918.92 2922.92 SPEAKER_05  Who will ever fall in love with this hideous Matt Damon with a fake nose on?
2922.92 2928.92 SPEAKER_04  They call it, well he's also wearing like a Jean-son suit, which is- Yeah, he's bald as well.
2928.92 2930.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, a little problematic, like the white boy wearing the mouse suit.
2930.92 2933.92 SPEAKER_04  But anyway- It's like the reviewer from Ratatouille, actually.
2933.92 2936.92 SPEAKER_03  The Anton Ego fit?
2936.92 2937.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, yeah.
2937.92 2943.92 SPEAKER_03  There's quite a dark line where they're gonna get him this like chemical accelerant to make the seducing easier, this aphrodisiac.
2943.92 2945.92 SPEAKER_04  Did you catch what they call this, by the way?
2945.92 2946.92 SPEAKER_04  An accelerator, right?
2946.92 2948.92 SPEAKER_04  No, they call it the Gilroy.
2948.92 2949.92 SPEAKER_04  What's that?
2949.92 2966.92 SPEAKER_04  They call it, and they call it the Gilroy in a kind of troubling reference to Tony Gilroy, the guy who directs the Bourne movies, so it's like, if we can borrow Matt Damon for one phone call off your set, we will make your name synonymous with smelling so good that a woman fucks you.
2966.92 2969.92 SPEAKER_03  Is he alleged- is he known to do that?
2969.92 2970.92 SPEAKER_03  The guy who directs the Bourne films?
2970.92 2971.92 SPEAKER_03  I don't fucking know.
2971.92 2977.92 SPEAKER_05  I think it would be irresponsible for me to guess here, but he's probably a notorious sex pest.
2977.92 2980.92 SPEAKER_04  I don't think we can say that.
2980.92 2982.92 SPEAKER_04  Well, I've heard it alleged.
2982.92 2984.92 SPEAKER_05  By you, just now.
2985.92 2987.92 SPEAKER_04  And that doesn't count?
2987.92 2990.92 SPEAKER_04  You've heard discussion of this?
2990.92 2992.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, we're talking about it right now.
2992.92 2998.92 SPEAKER_03  But if I was this guy, I would not want my name to be associated with this thing, which is essentially a kind of like roofie patch.
2998.92 2999.92 SPEAKER_03  Yes, genuinely.
2999.92 3003.92 SPEAKER_04  I'm so glad you say that right, because this is the thing, right?
3003.92 3004.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, yeah.
3004.92 3008.92 SPEAKER_04  They describe it as like a pheromone, it's got like pheromone fucking scents wafting off of it, right?
3008.92 3023.92 SPEAKER_04  We have no idea if like human sex pheromones exist, and you're in this weird space where the movie presents it like they do, and they're so effective that using them is kind of like date, right?
3023.92 3024.92 SPEAKER_05  Yes.
3024.92 3025.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
3025.92 3028.92 SPEAKER_05  Should get out ahead of us and say human sex pheromones don't exist.
3028.92 3029.92 SPEAKER_05  No.
3029.92 3030.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3030.92 3037.92 SPEAKER_03  All the stuff I have about the bimbification gas that's not actually real, that's just a fun part of a fantasy between consenting people and one person who wants to be force-famed.
3037.92 3044.92 SPEAKER_04  If there actually was some way to like vitiate someone's consent with a smell like that, like it would be unethical.
3044.92 3049.92 SPEAKER_03  Which is also, it's very dark that Don Cheadle is like, get two, and they're like, no, you don't need it, no.
3049.92 3051.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, like I can imagine what two would do.
3051.92 3056.92 SPEAKER_05  I mean, we'll get to this when we get to the scene, but this woman becomes so horny, she becomes stupid.
3056.92 3057.92 SPEAKER_05  She can't walk.
3057.92 3061.92 SPEAKER_05  It's actually kind of hard to watch in some moments.
3061.92 3064.92 SPEAKER_03  I'm glad that they don't have sex, because that would be rape.
3064.92 3067.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, no, it would be, yeah, a spike option.
3067.92 3069.92 SPEAKER_04  It is problematic.
3069.92 3072.92 SPEAKER_04  Alright, my next note just says the dice look delicious.
3072.92 3084.92 SPEAKER_04  In my defense, there's a lot of shots of them like wrapping these like very clear, very green dice in like gold foil, and then unwrapping them.
3084.92 3085.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, they look like Turkish delight.
3085.92 3088.92 SPEAKER_04  I'm just, I have a very sensory response to that, I guess.
3088.92 3091.92 SPEAKER_03  We need to come up with something for Bernie Mac to do.
3091.92 3092.92 SPEAKER_03  I forgot he was in this.
3092.92 3093.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3093.92 3094.92 SPEAKER_03  Oh, fuck he is, isn't he?
3094.92 3095.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, so there's a movie.
3095.92 3099.92 SPEAKER_03  Because they go to the gaming expo, which like nobody's wearing caddies, first of all, what are you doing?
3099.92 3106.92 SPEAKER_03  Like, and Bernie Mac has invented Casino Dominoes, and wants to get it into Al Pacino's casino because of reasons.
3106.92 3107.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3107.92 3115.92 SPEAKER_03  And then they do this whole thing where like Terry Benedict Casino Dracula is like, I want Casino Dominoes in my casino, and Al Pacino's like, no, I will put you in my casino on opening night.
3115.92 3117.92 SPEAKER_03  So you're gonna be in the movie, Bernie Mac.
3117.92 3121.92 SPEAKER_03  Not entirely clear what he does in this heist, but he's there.
3121.92 3125.92 SPEAKER_05  I guess it's just like another machine that will pay out a lot, I suppose.
3125.92 3126.92 SPEAKER_05  I guess.
3126.92 3127.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
3127.92 3128.92 SPEAKER_05  But also-
3128.92 3136.92 SPEAKER_03  It's nothing at all. Danny Ocean has somehow convinced all of the high rollers to leave and like not be in the hotel anymore.
3136.92 3146.92 SPEAKER_03  So the night of the grand opening comes and they have a sumo match, and all the high rollers are sitting with Danny Ocean on the opposite side of the room to Al Pacino, and Al Pacino's like, fuck, like, what are you doing?
3146.92 3149.92 SPEAKER_03  Like, why are you- why did you make them all leave and then bring them all back?
3149.92 3150.92 SPEAKER_03  What are you doing, man?
3150.92 3153.92 SPEAKER_04  The casino is an interesting kind of pan-Asian experience, right?
3153.92 3162.92 SPEAKER_04  Because, like, when the real reviewer is being tormented, one of the things they arrange for him to do is not be able to get a table at the restaurant.
3162.92 3167.92 SPEAKER_04  They're described as Cantonese-inspired Szechuan flavors.
3167.92 3168.92 SPEAKER_04  Mmhmm.
3168.92 3178.92 SPEAKER_04  And then you've got like a sumo tournament, and then Cameron Diaz refers to like the Asian high roller villas as well, and it's like, this is...
3178.92 3179.92 SPEAKER_04  Mmhmm.
3179.92 3186.92 SPEAKER_04  I mean, not to suggest that actual Las Vegas is like a paragon of like cultural sensitivity or anything, but like...
3186.92 3187.92 SPEAKER_04  Mmhmm.
3187.92 3188.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, still.
3188.92 3190.92 SPEAKER_04  Oh, there's also a bunch of shit about like, uh, shafts.
3190.92 3193.92 SPEAKER_04  I just mention it because I have the drops.
3193.92 3195.92 SPEAKER_01  These are the shafts we have to clap an eyeball on.
3195.92 3198.92 SPEAKER_01  Now there's still no way of knowing the thickness of it.
3198.92 3200.92 SPEAKER_01  Anything thicker than five inches would be a problem.
3200.92 3202.92 SPEAKER_01  I'm saying.
3202.92 3205.92 SPEAKER_04  This is not important.
3205.92 3208.92 SPEAKER_04  It's just, it's filler, it's absolutely filler.
3208.92 3211.92 SPEAKER_04  You could cut like, I think, an hour out of this movie, basically.
3211.92 3212.92 SPEAKER_04  Oh, effortlessly.
3212.92 3213.92 SPEAKER_05  Here's some more filler.
3213.92 3216.92 SPEAKER_05  The whole hotel reviewer guy thing.
3216.92 3217.92 SPEAKER_05  Mmhmm.
3217.92 3222.92 SPEAKER_05  So he gets given a room that isn't very good, they release a stinky gas into his room.
3222.92 3223.92 SPEAKER_05  They hit him with a gas!
3223.92 3224.92 SPEAKER_04  We love a gas!
3224.92 3225.92 SPEAKER_05  They hit him with a gas, love to see a gas.
3225.92 3226.92 SPEAKER_05  I am throwing gas on ice.
3226.92 3227.92 SPEAKER_04  One of my favorite states of matter.
3227.92 3228.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, absolutely.
3228.92 3229.92 SPEAKER_04  Doing gas merch.
3229.92 3230.92 SPEAKER_04  Top three, easily.
3230.92 3233.92 SPEAKER_04  Where it's just like gas, it's a state of matter.
3233.92 3234.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3234.92 3238.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, if you want us to do gas merch, actually do, let me know, because that's very funny.
3238.92 3240.92 SPEAKER_04  Welcome to Scenic Gas.
3240.92 3241.92 SPEAKER_04  It's, uh...
3241.92 3242.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3242.92 3246.92 SPEAKER_03  They put bed bugs in his bed, they give him a rash.
3246.92 3250.92 SPEAKER_03  The security guard's natural enemy, gas!
3250.92 3253.92 SPEAKER_05  Or throwing knives, you know?
3253.92 3254.92 SPEAKER_05  They're weak to two things.
3254.92 3255.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, those are the two.
3255.92 3258.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, hate when there is a gas, but when there's no gas at all, that's a problem as well.
3258.92 3259.92 SPEAKER_05  That's true.
3259.92 3260.92 SPEAKER_05  You want it to be some gas.
3260.92 3261.92 SPEAKER_05  Live by the gas, die by the gas.
3261.92 3268.92 SPEAKER_03  So they gas this, but they gas him up, they give him bed bugs, all the staff are rude to him because they bribe them.
3268.92 3269.92 SPEAKER_03  At one point...
3269.92 3271.92 SPEAKER_04  They basically gangstalk this man.
3271.92 3272.92 SPEAKER_04  They do, yeah, it's funny.
3272.92 3273.92 SPEAKER_03  They do!
3273.92 3278.92 SPEAKER_03  The Mormon brothers, they throw him out of the casino, they blame the stench on him and like, ask him to leave.
3278.92 3279.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3279.92 3280.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, they're like...
3280.92 3285.92 SPEAKER_05  They kick him out, they're so mean to him, and they're like sprinting around the casino this whole time.
3285.92 3287.92 SPEAKER_05  They just arrive at his door and are like, get the fuck out!
3287.92 3292.92 SPEAKER_04  Fucking proletarian solidarity, these are the guys doing all the running work, they're the guys doing all the labor.
3292.92 3294.92 SPEAKER_04  These are my boys right here.
3294.92 3299.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, these guys better organize DSA Ocean's Eleven after this.
3299.92 3315.92 SPEAKER_04  The other thing is, Saul is getting pampered because they think he's the real reviewer, and then at the end of this, he goes past Al Pacino, who he's met, and he's tried to bust him up a bit, and he slaps his ass.
3315.92 3316.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, he gropes him.
3316.92 3324.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, and like, gives him a thumbs up, and it's like, I think at that moment, oh, okay, you've planted the fucking, like, magnetron or whatever on him.
3324.92 3325.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3325.92 3326.92 SPEAKER_04  No.
3326.92 3332.92 SPEAKER_04  For no reason to just be like, sexually assault the object of your heist.
3332.92 3334.92 SPEAKER_04  I mean, maybe this is the revenge, right?
3334.92 3335.92 SPEAKER_04  He's feeling himself too much.
3335.92 3342.92 SPEAKER_04  Maybe this is, I'm gonna get close to Bank and I don't care if it gets messy, he's just gonna grope him, but they're like, that's like, not moral, you know?
3342.92 3343.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3343.92 3344.92 SPEAKER_03  You're not allowed to do that.
3344.92 3346.92 SPEAKER_03  There's something very nearly goes wrong.
3346.92 3354.92 SPEAKER_03  So, Livingston's job was to sabotage the Blackjack machines, and the cops arrive and they arrest him and expose him to Al Pacino.
3354.92 3358.92 SPEAKER_03  They're like, he's tampered with the machines, you've gotta swap all the machines out.
3358.92 3360.92 SPEAKER_03  And we think, oh no, the Blackjack sabotage has gone wrong.
3360.92 3363.92 SPEAKER_03  But then it's Susie Izzard switching out the machines, right?
3363.92 3364.92 SPEAKER_03  So, okay, that actually went to plan.
3364.92 3372.92 SPEAKER_03  But Al Pacino's too clever for them because they're like, oh, get his fingerprints off the machine, find out his identity and all of his known associates.
3372.92 3374.92 SPEAKER_03  And they're like, oh shit, he's too good.
3374.92 3375.92 SPEAKER_04  Don Cheadle has to save the day.
3375.92 3376.92 SPEAKER_04  Oh shit, that's all of us.
3376.92 3377.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3377.92 3383.92 SPEAKER_04  This is the movie sucking itself off big time in that it does a bunch of accent jokes here.
3383.92 3389.92 SPEAKER_04  When he gets the call to do this, he's got a voice training book by his laptop, which I think is kind of funny.
3389.92 3395.92 SPEAKER_04  And then they give him a second chance at an accent, he gets to do an American one in character this time.
3395.92 3396.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3396.92 3409.92 SPEAKER_04  Because his job is literally to just go into Pacino's office and like a Dungeons & Dragons campaign, just go to an NPC, be as annoying as possible, do bits until you run out of things to say.
3409.92 3412.92 SPEAKER_05  Because he's got to distract him from looking at the screen.
3412.92 3419.92 SPEAKER_05  He's disguised himself as the like, the stunt motorcyclist that they have for the opening night or whatever.
3419.92 3432.92 SPEAKER_03  They distract the stunt driver by getting two sex workers to like fuck him in his trailer and chuck his big American flag outfit out of the window so Don Cheadle can put it on and disguise himself as the stunt driver.
3432.92 3440.92 SPEAKER_03  So he's like distracting Al Pacino whilst the Mormon brothers are hacking his computer in the background and changing the pictures and names of the criminal associates.
3440.92 3441.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3441.92 3442.92 SPEAKER_04  So they keep getting away with it.
3442.92 3445.92 SPEAKER_04  There's an inexplicable kind of connection of these.
3445.92 3449.92 SPEAKER_04  It's like Walt Disney's last words being Kurt Russell.
3449.92 3457.92 SPEAKER_04  I just, because of this, I don't have it as a drop, but there exists in the world audio of Al Pacino saying Travis Pastrana.
3457.92 3458.92 SPEAKER_04  And I'm just like...
3458.92 3459.92 SPEAKER_04  Mm.
3459.92 3460.92 SPEAKER_04  Okay, cool.
3460.92 3462.92 SPEAKER_04  This works, by the way.
3462.92 3465.92 SPEAKER_04  The Mormon brothers are like bickering throughout.
3465.92 3469.92 SPEAKER_04  They have great, like, you wouldn't call it chemistry, brother chemistry.
3469.92 3470.92 SPEAKER_04  Fraternal chemistry.
3470.92 3471.92 SPEAKER_02  Yeah.
3471.92 3472.92 SPEAKER_02  Mmhmm.
3472.92 3475.92 SPEAKER_05  It's almost impossible to write realistic brothers.
3475.92 3477.92 SPEAKER_05  And again, they really are nailing it with this.
3477.92 3478.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3478.92 3479.92 SPEAKER_05  Which I like a lot.
3479.92 3480.92 SPEAKER_03  I like it.
3480.92 3481.92 SPEAKER_03  It's good.
3481.92 3482.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, it's great.
3482.92 3489.92 SPEAKER_03  Rusty primes the slot machines that they've hacked so that the next lady who uses it wins 30 million dollars and the supercomputer analyzes it and it's like, oh, it's a genuine win.
3489.92 3491.92 SPEAKER_03  Like, her pupils have dilated it up.
3491.92 3492.92 SPEAKER_03  She's like really, really want.
3492.92 3493.92 SPEAKER_04  She doesn't know.
3493.92 3496.92 SPEAKER_04  They call the scam the Susan B. Anthony, by the way.
3496.92 3497.92 SPEAKER_04  Um, fuck knows why.
3497.92 3498.92 SPEAKER_04  Which is what?
3498.92 3499.92 SPEAKER_03  I don't care.
3499.92 3500.92 SPEAKER_04  Cool, yeah.
3500.92 3501.92 SPEAKER_04  I don't care.
3501.92 3502.92 SPEAKER_04  Bizarre.
3502.92 3505.92 SPEAKER_04  Like I said, this movie is very, very pleased with itself.
3505.92 3511.92 SPEAKER_04  Like, the same with the roulette thing, which is like, oh, it's gonna pay out on three numbers and the guy bets 11, 12, 13.
3511.92 3512.92 SPEAKER_04  And it's like, okay.
3512.92 3513.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, great.
3513.92 3514.92 SPEAKER_03  Fantastic.
3514.92 3519.92 SPEAKER_04  I do kind of like that for the first time in a casino heist movie, they get to heist the actual casino games.
3519.92 3520.92 SPEAKER_04  Yes, that's fun.
3520.92 3521.92 SPEAKER_04  It is nice, yeah.
3521.92 3522.92 SPEAKER_04  It is nice, that's fun.
3522.92 3528.92 SPEAKER_04  So the way this works is Pacino goes to check on the fucking like Grok AI, right, and be like, is this using enough water?
3528.92 3534.92 SPEAKER_04  And the second he walks in, it's like, thing shuts down, doors sealed, phones cut off.
3534.92 3535.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3535.92 3537.92 SPEAKER_04  Cause he's got the, like, fake phone with the magnetron in it.
3537.92 3538.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
3538.92 3539.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3539.92 3540.92 SPEAKER_05  He's taking it straight down there.
3540.92 3541.92 SPEAKER_05  Cavity magnetron disaster.
3541.92 3548.92 SPEAKER_05  It's the second the last wins that game, like he goes down there to see what the fuck's going on and that shuts everything off.
3548.92 3551.92 SPEAKER_04  Andy Garcia is watching this and this is when he makes the noise.
3551.92 3553.92 SPEAKER_04  And I have the noise in context.
3553.92 3558.92 SPEAKER_04  Yes.
3558.92 3562.92 SPEAKER_02  This is really pleasing.
3562.92 3564.92 SPEAKER_03  Big, big fan of that.
3564.92 3565.92 SPEAKER_03  Thank you, Andy Garcia.
3565.92 3573.92 SPEAKER_03  So with the Greco shut off, they've got three and a half minutes to, to, to, to, to, to like, everybody plays your best.
3573.92 3574.92 SPEAKER_03  Ka-ching!
3574.92 3577.92 SPEAKER_03  My notes say, remember everybody, gambling is fun and it's very easy to win.
3577.92 3587.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, if you recall the original Ocean's Eleven, right, one of the things that they did was, they cut the power and it was a more cynical movie about, about people in this respect.
3587.92 3592.92 SPEAKER_04  People are like, it looks like Event Horizon there, people are biting each other's thumbs off trying to get like handfuls of chips.
3592.92 3600.92 SPEAKER_04  Whereas here, there's like two kind of, like, four shock earthquakes and the thing kind of like shuts down.
3600.92 3608.92 SPEAKER_04  Everybody starts winning and the casino, like, regresses to a kind of like pre-debt rudimentary communism situation.
3608.92 3609.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3609.92 3614.92 SPEAKER_04  Which is nice, I guess, that happens.
3614.92 3616.92 SPEAKER_03  Everybody starts winning every game.
3616.92 3617.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3617.92 3619.92 SPEAKER_03  We get this big montage of like, isn't gambling fun?
3619.92 3620.92 SPEAKER_03  Gambling, gambling.
3620.92 3621.92 SPEAKER_05  You know?
3621.92 3624.92 SPEAKER_05  It would, I bet it would feel so good to win.
3624.92 3626.92 SPEAKER_05  But, I gotta say, I think it would feel awful to lose.
3626.92 3627.92 SPEAKER_05  That's true.
3627.92 3629.92 SPEAKER_05  And it seems like that happens more often, so.
3629.92 3636.92 SPEAKER_04  The thing finally reboots, we get a great shot of Pacino running down a hallway old man style.
3636.92 3637.92 SPEAKER_04  Don't ask him to do that.
3637.92 3639.92 SPEAKER_04  Don't ask old man to run.
3639.92 3641.92 SPEAKER_03  They can't, his hips won't do it.
3641.92 3644.92 SPEAKER_03  He sort of, he does like, he waddles like a bird.
3644.92 3648.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, it's like I'm saying, a hard cut off for running was like three years after this.
3648.92 3650.92 SPEAKER_05  This is a very intermediate Pacino.
3650.92 3656.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, but so while Cameron Diaz is fucking Matt Damon, the FBI...
3656.92 3657.92 SPEAKER_04  Not fucking him, crucially.
3657.92 3661.92 SPEAKER_04  The FBI come in, and they're like, this guy, that's fucking Matt Damon.
3661.92 3662.92 SPEAKER_04  He was in the Bourne Identity.
3662.92 3664.92 SPEAKER_04  He was raised by fishermen.
3664.92 3665.92 SPEAKER_04  He's wearing like...
3665.92 3667.92 SPEAKER_04  This guy needs to get back to London right now.
3667.92 3668.92 SPEAKER_02  He's needed on set.
3668.92 3669.92 SPEAKER_04  He's doing a different set, yeah.
3669.92 3672.92 SPEAKER_04  He's wearing like a body harness full of diamonds.
3672.92 3674.92 SPEAKER_04  It's like sick as hell.
3674.92 3677.92 SPEAKER_04  He's getting arrested.
3677.92 3678.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, yeah.
3678.92 3684.92 SPEAKER_04  And she kind of like realizes, she like sobers up in that moment, because, you know, the pheromones.
3684.92 3685.92 SPEAKER_04  And she's like, oh fuck.
3685.92 3687.92 SPEAKER_03  Pheromones don't affect the cops, which is interesting.
3687.92 3690.92 SPEAKER_03  Just a bunch of horny FBI agents.
3690.92 3691.92 SPEAKER_04  Oh, actually, hold on.
3691.92 3693.92 SPEAKER_04  I'm like, you know, putting a...
3693.92 3697.92 SPEAKER_05  The FBI's coming in like, oh, I wanna fuck this guy.
3697.92 3698.92 SPEAKER_05  Put a little...
3698.92 3699.92 SPEAKER_05  No one on.
3699.92 3702.92 SPEAKER_03  It's probably a good thing that it doesn't as well.
3702.92 3707.92 SPEAKER_05  Yes, I will say it is fun to see Ellen Barkin be like...
3707.92 3710.92 SPEAKER_05  Her character going from like, this is crazy.
3710.92 3711.92 SPEAKER_05  It's like, wow, what?
3711.92 3712.92 SPEAKER_05  I've just been caught.
3712.92 3713.92 SPEAKER_05  And then like, oh, I'm ruined.
3713.92 3714.92 SPEAKER_05  Oh, I'm never working on this time again.
3714.92 3715.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, yeah.
3715.92 3716.92 SPEAKER_04  Shit.
3716.92 3717.92 SPEAKER_04  This is the losing.
3717.92 3718.92 SPEAKER_04  This is crazy.
3718.92 3719.92 SPEAKER_05  Oh shit.
3719.92 3720.92 SPEAKER_05  I'm over.
3720.92 3721.92 SPEAKER_05  It's done for me.
3721.92 3723.92 SPEAKER_04  It's like, oh, my life is over.
3723.92 3724.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3724.92 3729.92 SPEAKER_04  Just like penciling in like, on my Samsung phone with a calendar with like a numpad.
3729.92 3731.92 SPEAKER_04  I'm like, I can kill myself.
3731.92 3732.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3732.92 3734.92 SPEAKER_04  Cancels every other...
3734.92 3740.92 SPEAKER_03  It's a good thing that the cops don't get horny though, because of course the cop that arrests him is Matt Damon's dad.
3740.92 3741.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, they did.
3741.92 3747.92 SPEAKER_04  There's a bit earlier where Don Cheadle does the line where it's like, you don't do the same gag twice.
3747.92 3750.92 SPEAKER_04  And then they do the same gag twice, which is the gag, right?
3750.92 3751.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3751.92 3756.92 SPEAKER_05  And it's the gag I complained about not being able to predict last time, and you still can't predict it this time.
3756.92 3757.92 SPEAKER_05  I guess they did it before, so you should...
3757.92 3759.92 SPEAKER_05  You should just, yeah, assume that nothing...
3759.92 3760.92 SPEAKER_05  But yeah, no, it's his dad.
3760.92 3762.92 SPEAKER_04  I mean, basically I do.
3762.92 3768.92 SPEAKER_04  Like, this is my problem with the movie, is that like, everything that happens, I go, well, nothing bad can happen to these guys, right?
3768.92 3770.92 SPEAKER_04  Nothing sticks, because it's not that kind of movie.
3770.92 3774.92 SPEAKER_04  So, of course his dad gets him out of the thing, and then, Vassar Kassel...
3774.92 3776.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, the night fox is there also.
3776.92 3777.92 SPEAKER_04  The night fox...
3777.92 3783.92 SPEAKER_04  Supply chain issues with the little night fox statuettes, but what he is wearing is he's up against a stained glass wall.
3783.92 3788.92 SPEAKER_05  The factory in Mexico that makes his little night fox statuettes has been unionized right now.
3788.92 3789.92 SPEAKER_05  He's fucking...
3789.92 3790.92 SPEAKER_04  Shit!
3790.92 3798.92 SPEAKER_04  He's up against a stained glass wall, and he's wearing a real, like, Metal Gear Solid 3, like, specific, like, stained glass wall camouflage.
3798.92 3799.92 SPEAKER_04  Yes, he is, yeah.
3799.92 3801.92 SPEAKER_04  I really like this.
3801.92 3802.92 SPEAKER_04  This is so fucking stupid.
3802.92 3803.92 SPEAKER_04  I really like this as a decision.
3803.92 3804.92 SPEAKER_04  He's got a wingsuit on.
3804.92 3805.92 SPEAKER_03  He does.
3805.92 3806.92 SPEAKER_04  Cool.
3806.92 3813.92 SPEAKER_03  So they escape to the roof with the real diamonds, at which point night fox appears with a gun, which is the best gadget.
3813.92 3814.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3814.92 3816.92 SPEAKER_04  This is very close to 007.
3816.92 3819.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, Matt Damon's like, what the fuck, man?
3819.92 3820.92 SPEAKER_03  He goes, a gun?
3820.92 3821.92 SPEAKER_03  What the fuck?
3821.92 3826.92 SPEAKER_04  This creates, like, a large hole through someone's organs.
3826.92 3828.92 SPEAKER_04  A portable hole.
3828.92 3829.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3829.92 3831.92 SPEAKER_03  I set up this gun early on.
3831.92 3833.92 SPEAKER_03  And he fucking mugs them.
3833.92 3838.92 SPEAKER_03  He mugs them for the diamonds and then just, like, base jumps off the top of the roof, which I think is pretty sick.
3838.92 3839.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, that is sick.
3839.92 3844.92 SPEAKER_04  And then you go, okay, but they switched the diamonds early, because nothing bad can happen to these guys.
3844.92 3845.92 SPEAKER_04  And you're right.
3845.92 3846.92 SPEAKER_04  Of course.
3846.92 3850.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, but the thing, and what is revealed is that they didn't swap the diamonds.
3850.92 3853.92 SPEAKER_05  Like, those were the fake diamonds that he had gone in to swap.
3853.92 3854.92 SPEAKER_03  Hmm.
3854.92 3855.92 SPEAKER_05  And the real ones are still in the thing.
3855.92 3857.92 SPEAKER_03  Because they knew that the night fox would...
3857.92 3861.92 SPEAKER_03  Because they read the script before the scene happened.
3861.92 3869.92 SPEAKER_04  Then, because of Yen's, like, fucking vent-climbing bullshit and having planted some explosives, they get a helicopter...
3869.92 3870.92 SPEAKER_04  I wanna...
3870.92 3872.92 SPEAKER_04  I do think that Linus plants the explosives.
3872.92 3873.92 SPEAKER_04  He does.
3873.92 3874.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, he does.
3874.92 3875.92 SPEAKER_04  He does.
3875.92 3876.92 SPEAKER_04  Well, he plants one set, Yen plants the other.
3876.92 3877.92 SPEAKER_04  That's true, yes.
3877.92 3880.92 SPEAKER_04  And then they use a helicopter to take the whole enclosure out.
3880.92 3887.92 SPEAKER_04  And, uh, as Pacino's, like, because they trigger the earthquake, people are fleeing with their winnings, which I'm not sure how that works.
3887.92 3888.92 SPEAKER_04  Um...
3888.92 3894.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, so, just to pause, when you win in a casino, you win chips, you have to go to the little window and cash them out.
3894.92 3895.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3895.92 3896.92 SPEAKER_03  So they hit the...
3896.92 3900.92 SPEAKER_03  They wiggle the building and it's an earthquake evacuation and everyone walks out with their...
3900.92 3901.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
3901.92 3902.92 SPEAKER_03  How do they cash them out?
3902.92 3904.92 SPEAKER_04  The world's fastest cashiers.
3904.92 3905.92 SPEAKER_04  Um, and so...
3905.92 3906.92 SPEAKER_04  Red skeleton is there?
3906.92 3907.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3907.92 3908.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, yeah.
3908.92 3909.92 SPEAKER_04  Uh...
3909.92 3910.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3910.92 3913.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, red skeleton is doing the yes.
3913.92 3921.92 SPEAKER_05  They get out the top and it's, you know, Linus's father comes and picks him up, they get to a roof and red skeleton's there, he goes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3921.92 3923.92 SPEAKER_05  Hand over those diamonds, pal.
3923.92 3926.92 SPEAKER_05  I wasn't expecting a sort of, like, 89th minute red skeleton.
3926.92 3931.92 SPEAKER_05  I'm obsessed with red skeleton, I think red skeleton is my favourite bit.
3931.92 3933.92 SPEAKER_04  Before, like, on the, like, before the buzzer.
3933.92 3940.92 SPEAKER_04  Um, but so Al Pacino sees the helicopter leaving with his diamonds and he just very softly goes, my diamonds!
3940.92 3941.92 SPEAKER_04  Which I, which I really...
3941.92 3942.92 SPEAKER_04  Best line reading.
3942.92 3945.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, me when the window shows up in Ballotra.
3945.92 3946.92 SPEAKER_04  My diamonds.
3946.92 3947.92 SPEAKER_03  Oh.
3947.92 3953.92 SPEAKER_03  I feel like Al Pacino could very easily say we had a computer problem and all bets between this time and this time will not be on it.
3953.92 3955.92 SPEAKER_04  There was a fucking earthquake!
3955.92 3956.92 SPEAKER_04  It's force majeure!
3956.92 3957.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, exactly.
3957.92 3963.92 SPEAKER_05  I guess the point of them, like, leaving is that they've taken the money out already, but, like, again, how are they cashing that?
3963.92 3964.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
3964.92 3967.92 SPEAKER_05  They're not cashing it on the way out while they're evacuating, like, you're not going via the concierge.
3967.92 3968.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
3968.92 3970.92 SPEAKER_04  He's lost 500 million in chips, but then...
3970.92 3971.92 SPEAKER_04  Not my chips!
3971.92 3976.92 SPEAKER_04  But, like, Danny Ocean has to confront him face-to-face again.
3976.92 3981.92 SPEAKER_04  I mean, I, this guy's gonna fucking hunt you down Ocean's 14 style, right?
3981.92 3982.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3982.92 3983.92 SPEAKER_03  And he says that as well, he's just like, fine, I'm just gonna kill you.
3983.92 3984.92 SPEAKER_03  Look at Ocean's 14 year ass.
3984.92 3985.92 SPEAKER_04  Like, it's over.
3985.92 3986.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
3986.92 3990.92 SPEAKER_03  And Danny Ocean just goes, no you won't, you're not gonna kill me because everyone likes me, I'm George Clooney.
3990.92 3995.92 SPEAKER_04  He defeats him with the power of smugness, and that's two for two because he did that to Cassell as well.
3995.92 4000.92 SPEAKER_04  He just goes, I'm George Clooney, I look like George Clooney, everybody likes me.
4000.92 4001.92 SPEAKER_03  And...
4001.92 4005.92 SPEAKER_03  He says, I know all the people who you would hire to kill me and they're not gonna kill me because they like me more than you.
4005.92 4006.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
4006.92 4008.92 SPEAKER_03  You could find somebody with like, who just wants money.
4008.92 4009.92 SPEAKER_03  There's more.
4009.92 4010.92 SPEAKER_03  You could find someone new.
4010.92 4012.92 SPEAKER_03  You could get some new assassin talent, some new blood.
4012.92 4013.92 SPEAKER_05  I don't, I don't wanna be rude to you, brother.
4013.92 4017.92 SPEAKER_05  You hadn't even heard of the most successful, like, thief in Europe up until this point.
4017.92 4018.92 SPEAKER_05  Mm-hmm.
4018.92 4021.92 SPEAKER_05  Like, I don't think that you know everyone that he could possibly hire to kill you.
4021.92 4022.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
4022.92 4027.92 SPEAKER_05  But he goes like, you're not gonna do it because you shook hands with Frank Sinatra and that, there's like, there's Bushido going on here.
4027.92 4029.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, he's like, fucking like, wise up.
4029.92 4030.92 SPEAKER_03  Ring a ding.
4030.92 4033.92 SPEAKER_03  He also says, you're not gonna go to the cops because let's face it, you're not gonna go to the cops and I'm like, why not?
4033.92 4037.92 SPEAKER_03  Write yourself into the corner and then just kind of like, paper it.
4037.92 4038.92 SPEAKER_05  You won't...
4038.92 4039.92 SPEAKER_05  Why not?
4039.92 4040.92 SPEAKER_05  You won't go to the cops.
4040.92 4041.92 SPEAKER_04  Movie's over.
4041.92 4042.92 SPEAKER_04  Maybe you will.
4042.92 4044.92 SPEAKER_04  You know how I know you're not gonna go to the cops?
4044.92 4045.92 SPEAKER_05  Cause you...
4045.92 4048.92 SPEAKER_05  Cause the movie ends in about two seconds time and I didn't write you go to the cops.
4048.92 4049.92 SPEAKER_05  Goodbye.
4049.92 4050.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
4050.92 4055.92 SPEAKER_05  It's the fucking, what's the, what was the reboot movie, um, oh god.
4055.92 4061.92 SPEAKER_05  The, oh shit, the like, Rainbow Six ass, uh, movie that we covered a little bit ago.
4061.92 4062.92 SPEAKER_05  The one with Michael B. Jordan?
4062.92 4064.92 SPEAKER_05  Like, No Regrets or some shit like that, right?
4064.92 4065.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
4065.92 4066.92 SPEAKER_03  Ah, yeah, you might be right, yeah.
4066.92 4067.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
4067.92 4068.92 SPEAKER_05  It's exactly like that.
4068.92 4070.92 SPEAKER_05  It's like, it's definitely not called that.
4070.92 4071.92 SPEAKER_05  It's...
4071.92 4073.92 SPEAKER_05  Oh my, this is gonna annoy the hell out of me.
4073.92 4074.92 SPEAKER_04  With Michael B. Jordan.
4074.92 4075.92 SPEAKER_05  Um...
4075.92 4076.92 SPEAKER_05  With Michael B. Jordan.
4076.92 4077.92 SPEAKER_04  The, the, the, the...
4077.92 4078.92 SPEAKER_04  No remorse.
4078.92 4079.92 SPEAKER_04  John Clarke.
4079.92 4080.92 SPEAKER_04  No, without remorse.
4080.92 4081.92 SPEAKER_04  Without remorse.
4081.92 4082.92 SPEAKER_05  Without remorse.
4082.92 4083.92 SPEAKER_05  Okay, I was pretty close with No Mercy.
4083.92 4084.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
4084.92 4090.92 SPEAKER_05  The same thing, it's like, you wrote all of this already, so it's not clever that it works out for you, because you wrote it so it works out.
4090.92 4091.92 SPEAKER_05  Like, no one's impressed.
4091.92 4092.92 SPEAKER_05  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
4092.92 4095.92 SPEAKER_03  Oh, also Ruben's here, we forgot to mention, Ruben got better, he's fine.
4095.92 4100.92 SPEAKER_05  Ruben got better, he read all of, um, Basher, Kebashatar's like, heartfelt letters to him.
4100.92 4101.92 SPEAKER_05  Fanfics.
4101.92 4105.92 SPEAKER_03  He read all 300 of those fanfics and then was like, I can't stay in bed for you,
4105.92 4110.92 SPEAKER_04  and he's gonna become myself, I need to go and... I think reading 300 fanfics would probably like, make you better.
4110.92 4112.92 SPEAKER_04  If not, it would get you out of a hospital bed.
4112.92 4117.92 SPEAKER_03  That's why I'm so normal, but what does, can someone tell me what Bernie Mac does for the heist?
4117.92 4118.92 SPEAKER_03  Uh...
4118.92 4119.92 SPEAKER_03  How does Bernie Mac help?
4119.92 4120.92 SPEAKER_04  Uh...
4120.92 4124.92 SPEAKER_04  He does like, two bits in the, across the whole movie.
4124.92 4128.92 SPEAKER_03  But what, but how does Bernie Mac being in this movie facilitate money being made?
4128.92 4129.92 SPEAKER_03  Like, what?
4129.92 4131.92 SPEAKER_05  Well, it facilitates money being made by Bernie Mac.
4131.92 4132.92 SPEAKER_05  That's true.
4132.92 4135.92 SPEAKER_05  He heisted the fuck out of Oz.
4135.92 4136.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
4136.92 4141.92 SPEAKER_05  Um, yeah, no, I don't, he doesn't really have a key part to play in the heist.
4141.92 4145.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, if the domino table wasn't there, how would this have been, I don't know, anyway.
4145.92 4148.92 SPEAKER_03  Everybody watches the fireworks and listens to Frank Sinatra.
4148.92 4151.92 SPEAKER_04  They do, they, it's not Frank Sinatra, it's...
4151.92 4153.92 SPEAKER_04  It is now that time of day I have set apart for Debussy.
4153.92 4155.92 SPEAKER_04  It's Claire de Lune again!
4155.92 4157.92 SPEAKER_03  It's not, it's Sinatra.
4157.92 4158.92 SPEAKER_04  Is it?
4158.92 4159.92 SPEAKER_04  Are you sure?
4159.92 4165.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, you've Mandela reflected yourself and said, this town is a new town, and thank you downtown.
4165.92 4166.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, that is...
4166.92 4167.92 SPEAKER_04  Okay, but they do Claire de Lune first.
4167.92 4168.92 SPEAKER_04  They do Claire de Lune first.
4168.92 4169.92 SPEAKER_04  Oh, okay.
4169.92 4186.92 SPEAKER_04  Because they go to some other bullshit fountains and they're like, they do the like, the, uh, times have changed or whatever, but like, you know, the found family is forever, and, uh, we, you know, we hope that you've been on a real emotional journey with Oceans 11, 12, 13.
4186.92 4187.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
4187.92 4188.92 SPEAKER_05  We won't be making another.
4188.92 4189.92 SPEAKER_05  We're all bored.
4189.92 4190.92 SPEAKER_05  I haven't.
4190.92 4193.92 SPEAKER_05  They fuck over Terry Benedict as well, by the way.
4193.92 4197.92 SPEAKER_05  They donate his portion of the take to charity in his name.
4197.92 4210.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, and the real reviewer is like, they do the Susan B. Anthony to him, and win him like, 11 million dollars in the airport, which is a callback to set up.
4210.92 4211.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
4211.92 4214.92 SPEAKER_05  Because bad things don't actually happen, like, the guy's fine.
4214.92 4220.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, they rig a slot machine so that he wins, they put him through hell, but then he wins 11 million dollars on the slot machine.
4220.92 4233.92 SPEAKER_04  They do have a debate earlier on where they're like, would you get gang stalked for 10 million dollars, which is why it's 11, because Saul goes, yeah, I wouldn't get gang stalked for 10 million dollars, but I would get gang stalked for 11, which is like, okay.
4233.92 4234.92 SPEAKER_04  I don't know what my cutoff is.
4234.92 4236.92 SPEAKER_04  I think that this is where...
4236.92 4239.92 SPEAKER_05  Well, being trans in Britain means you're being gang stalked all the time no matter what.
4239.92 4240.92 SPEAKER_05  Exactly.
4240.92 4241.92 SPEAKER_05  And I don't have any millions of dollars.
4241.92 4242.92 SPEAKER_05  That's true.
4242.92 4244.92 SPEAKER_04  I mean, one at this point, like, I would set off a one.
4244.92 4246.92 SPEAKER_04  But like, one of the...
4246.92 4250.92 SPEAKER_03  The final moment is Matt Damon, George Clooney and Brad Pitt are in the airport.
4250.92 4252.92 SPEAKER_03  Matt Damon says I've got to go.
4252.92 4253.92 SPEAKER_03  I'm famous now.
4253.92 4256.92 SPEAKER_03  I have to go and make Bourne movies forever.
4256.92 4257.92 SPEAKER_03  Goodbye.
4257.92 4265.92 SPEAKER_03  Brad Pitt says goodbye to George Clooney, and then George Clooney has this line, which has become incredibly fucking dark.
4265.92 4269.92 SPEAKER_03  In retrospect, it's so fucking bleak.
4269.92 4274.92 SPEAKER_03  Like, the last thing Danny Ocean says to Rusty Ryan is, you should settle down.
4274.92 4275.92 SPEAKER_03  Have a couple kids.
4275.92 4282.92 SPEAKER_03  And it's like, Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Don't beat them though, don't beat them allegedly.
4282.92 4285.92 SPEAKER_03  Don't, don't hit your kids Brad Pitt allegedly.
4285.92 4289.92 SPEAKER_03  That's, mmm, yeah, that's pretty fucking dark.
4289.92 4290.92 SPEAKER_04  It's unfortunate.
4290.92 4291.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, don't do it.
4291.92 4306.92 SPEAKER_04  The thing, just to circle back about the getting gang stalked for 11 million dollars thing, because I think that's the best way to talk about the script writing for this movie, because so much of it is just like, you feel played because you heard something an hour ago that it's now like, calling back to.
4306.92 4312.92 SPEAKER_04  So, they mention that in passing, and then they fulfil it at the end of the movie when the guy gets paid off.
4312.92 4315.92 SPEAKER_04  And I think you're supposed to feel charmed by that.
4315.92 4325.92 SPEAKER_04  I think you're supposed to be like, yeah, this is fucking sick, the movie has like, tricked me, it's outwitted me, I feel like conned in a good way, like a gambling kind of.
4325.92 4326.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
4326.92 4338.92 SPEAKER_04  And it's just like, well not really though, because, I mean, maybe this is the same thing as gambling in the sense that it's like a very controlled environment, but like, there's no element of chance to this.
4338.92 4344.92 SPEAKER_04  There's no, it's just, you've set up a thing and it's just like, it's masturbatory, right?
4344.92 4349.92 SPEAKER_04  Like, it's just like, these guys jerking themselves off.
4349.92 4353.92 SPEAKER_04  There's no other, like, kind of, there's no variables involved.
4353.92 4357.92 SPEAKER_04  And so it's just kind of like, much like in the previous one where it's like, oh none of that stuff mattered.
4357.92 4360.92 SPEAKER_04  It's like, well I know none of this stuff matters, right?
4360.92 4370.92 SPEAKER_04  Because you're not, sort of like, the only sort of code you're following that would allow me to intuit that is, some shit about what you think Frank Sinatra would have done.
4370.92 4371.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
4371.92 4374.92 SPEAKER_04  Which was, I don't know, fucking kill Marilyn Monroe.
4374.92 4376.92 SPEAKER_05  I don't really care what he would have done.
4376.92 4378.92 SPEAKER_05  And you're wrong also about what Frank, yeah.
4378.92 4379.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
4379.92 4381.92 SPEAKER_05  You're wrong about Frank Sinatra as well.
4381.92 4382.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
4382.92 4383.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, I don't know.
4383.92 4384.92 SPEAKER_05  Not a great movie.
4384.92 4385.92 SPEAKER_05  No.
4385.92 4386.92 SPEAKER_05  Not a great series of movies.
4386.92 4387.92 SPEAKER_04  No.
4387.92 4388.92 SPEAKER_04  Didn't really have fun.
4388.92 4389.92 SPEAKER_04  Didn't really enjoy them.
4389.92 4395.92 SPEAKER_04  There were bits where I was kind of charmed, I like watching Clooney, it's kind of, that hits the beautiful face huge thing.
4395.92 4404.92 SPEAKER_04  A bit I forgot to mention is the critic sees the bugs, the bed bugs in his room, when he puts on a pair of Spy Kids 3 style glasses.
4404.92 4405.92 SPEAKER_04  He does, yeah.
4405.92 4408.92 SPEAKER_04  And I did like the fact that he has literal critical lenses.
4408.92 4409.92 SPEAKER_04  I think that's cool.
4409.92 4411.92 SPEAKER_04  That's quite cool, yeah.
4411.92 4412.92 SPEAKER_05  Other than that, yeah.
4412.92 4417.92 SPEAKER_05  I'd watch a movie that was just the two Mormon twins doing shit.
4417.92 4418.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
4418.92 4419.92 SPEAKER_05  Those are the only guys that I really care about.
4419.92 4421.92 SPEAKER_05  Two Mormon twins AO3 tag.
4421.92 4422.92 SPEAKER_05  Two brothers.
4422.92 4423.92 SPEAKER_04  Answer me that.
4423.92 4424.92 SPEAKER_04  That's insects.
4424.92 4425.92 SPEAKER_04  I hope not.
4425.92 4437.92 SPEAKER_03  I'm interested to see what they do with Ocean's 8, the all-female reboot though, because the heisting in this is so much a kind of homosocial activity that I'm interested to see like, okay, how will you do this with women?
4437.92 4438.92 SPEAKER_03  Why do women heist?
4438.92 4442.92 SPEAKER_04  They have so much less interest in women in this one.
4442.92 4443.92 SPEAKER_04  It's fully just like...
4443.92 4444.92 SPEAKER_03  Is it the same writers?
4444.92 4446.92 SPEAKER_05  Pit Clooney, as far as I know, yeah.
4446.92 4451.92 SPEAKER_05  It's ten years later as well, I think this was 2017 that Ocean's 8 came out.
4451.92 4454.92 SPEAKER_05  Oh, so deep in the real culture wars.
4454.92 4455.92 SPEAKER_05  I'm worried.
4455.92 4456.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, no, that's gonna be interesting.
4456.92 4459.92 SPEAKER_03  I wonder if it's gonna be a bit like the Charlie's Angels reboot then.
4459.92 4460.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
4460.92 4463.92 SPEAKER_05  I think it will be something akin to that.
4463.92 4464.92 SPEAKER_05  I'm interested.
4464.92 4465.92 SPEAKER_05  I'm kind of curious.
4465.92 4466.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
4466.92 4468.92 SPEAKER_05  I'll just wait for us to do Ghostbusters series, Christ.
4468.92 4469.92 SPEAKER_05  Okay, well...
4469.92 4471.92 SPEAKER_05  One good movie in that whole thing.
4471.92 4473.92 SPEAKER_05  Two, two.
4473.92 4476.92 SPEAKER_04  I mean, like, there's been three of these so far.
4476.92 4480.92 SPEAKER_04  We're almost at the end of them and I'm feeling kind of nothing.
4480.92 4483.92 SPEAKER_04  Like, I've had fun, but it's mostly just from...
4483.92 4484.92 SPEAKER_04  As with the movies, right?
4484.92 4487.92 SPEAKER_04  The real lesson of the movies is hanging out with your friends.
4487.92 4488.92 SPEAKER_04  That's it.
4488.92 4491.92 SPEAKER_04  We're all gonna watch Oprah and like, drink some red wine and cry.
4491.92 4492.92 SPEAKER_05  Gambling is fun.
4492.92 4500.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, it hasn't really given me a rubric through which to analyze heist movies, which I think was what we wanted from this opening, like, series, right?
4500.92 4504.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, it was gonna be like a tentpole thing and it heisted that out from under us, you know?
4504.92 4505.92 SPEAKER_04  I think it has.
4505.92 4510.92 SPEAKER_03  I think it has in that it's presented, like, heisting as a homosocial activity.
4510.92 4511.92 SPEAKER_03  True.
4511.92 4515.92 SPEAKER_03  And I'm very interested to go to the final film in the series and see how that can be challenged and reworked.
4515.92 4516.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, it's kind of...
4516.92 4517.92 SPEAKER_03  That is fair.
4517.92 4525.92 SPEAKER_04  There is a difference from a lot of other heist movies in the sense that I think that, like, the kind of masculinity that it's relying on to be like...
4525.92 4528.92 SPEAKER_04  Because all of this stuff, or any kind of masculine hero, it has some kind of...
4528.92 4533.92 SPEAKER_04  You have some kind of character traits or traits that are exceptional, right?
4533.92 4534.92 SPEAKER_04  Mm-hmm.
4534.92 4539.92 SPEAKER_04  And in this case, it's not that you're more audacious necessarily.
4539.92 4545.92 SPEAKER_04  It's not even that you're smarter because a lot of this stuff just doesn't come out because they plan it or even because the script plans it.
4545.92 4547.92 SPEAKER_04  It's just that you're kind of smug.
4547.92 4548.92 SPEAKER_04  You're just confident.
4548.92 4549.92 SPEAKER_04  It's a confidence trick in that way.
4549.92 4563.92 SPEAKER_04  Um, and I don't know that that's a necessarily representative thing, but it's definitely, like, a useful subset of heist movies to be like, this is a kind of, like, supreme masculine confidence.
4563.92 4564.92 SPEAKER_04  Also American, also white.
4564.92 4575.92 SPEAKER_04  To be like, I'm gonna sit in my house in Lake Como, my actual house, knock it off my sofa, and a scene about how I am, like, the greatest thief in the world is...
4575.92 4576.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
4576.92 4577.92 SPEAKER_04  Cool.
4577.92 4578.92 SPEAKER_03  Cool, man.
4578.92 4579.92 SPEAKER_03  Thanks, man.
4579.92 4585.92 SPEAKER_03  Sort of set me free as a writer because something that I worry about a lot when I'm writing is it too self-indulgent?
4585.92 4587.92 SPEAKER_03  Is it too, uh, pleased with itself?
4587.92 4589.92 SPEAKER_03  Am I condescending to my audience?
4589.92 4595.92 SPEAKER_03  And now I see that, like, oh, you can fully do that and just make, like, a hundred million dollars?
4595.92 4596.92 SPEAKER_03  So I'm like, great, I'm just gonna write whatever the fuck I want.
4596.92 4599.92 SPEAKER_04  I'm also white banging on the inside of the car window.
4599.92 4600.92 SPEAKER_04  Um...
4600.92 4601.92 SPEAKER_04  Like, no!
4601.92 4603.92 SPEAKER_03  You can only do that if you're a man!
4603.92 4604.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4604.92 4605.92 SPEAKER_03  We've been critiquing that!
4605.92 4606.92 SPEAKER_04  No!
4606.92 4609.92 SPEAKER_04  You were supposed to destroy the script, Christ.
4609.92 4610.92 SPEAKER_04  Uh, yeah.
4610.92 4613.92 SPEAKER_04  But, we don't have to be subjective about this, because...
4613.92 4614.92 SPEAKER_04  We certainly don't.
4614.92 4616.92 SPEAKER_04  We have a science-based system.
4616.92 4622.92 SPEAKER_04  It stands for SMUM, cultural insensitivity, unprovoked violence, and misogyny.
4622.92 4627.92 SPEAKER_04  I'm sick of unprovoked violence saving these movies, and I think that's gonna be a recurring thing.
4627.92 4630.92 SPEAKER_05  It's happening again because there's no unprovoked violence, not hugely.
4630.92 4633.92 SPEAKER_04  How smarmy is this movie?
4633.92 4635.92 SPEAKER_04  And I think, I gotta say, this is one of the worst we've ever done.
4635.92 4636.92 SPEAKER_04  This is the worst one.
4636.92 4637.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, it's ten.
4637.92 4638.92 SPEAKER_04  This is easily the worst one.
4638.92 4639.92 SPEAKER_04  Ten?
4639.92 4640.92 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, I'll do ten.
4640.92 4643.92 SPEAKER_03  The last one was nine, and it's smarmier than that, so you know, it's gotta be ten.
4643.92 4644.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
4644.92 4645.92 SPEAKER_04  Or perhaps eleven.
4646.92 4648.92 SPEAKER_03  No, because ten is the hard pack.
4648.92 4653.92 SPEAKER_05  We must maintain a hard barrier at ten, otherwise it gets insane.
4653.92 4654.92 SPEAKER_05  Cultural insensitivity.
4654.92 4655.92 SPEAKER_04  Cultural insensitivity.
4655.92 4662.92 SPEAKER_05  Again, it gets very Asian-focused with the casinos, but also I believe that the casinos in Las Vegas are that racist.
4662.92 4663.92 SPEAKER_05  That's true.
4663.92 4664.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
4664.92 4671.92 SPEAKER_04  The Mexico subplot I kind of both hate and love in and of itself.
4671.92 4673.92 SPEAKER_04  It is genuinely funny.
4673.92 4674.92 SPEAKER_03  Yes.
4674.92 4675.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
4675.92 4681.92 SPEAKER_04  But it is also like, the Mexico that it constructs, while it doesn't have a big yellow filter over it, is...
4681.92 4682.92 SPEAKER_04  A little bit.
4682.92 4683.92 SPEAKER_04  A little bit.
4683.92 4684.92 SPEAKER_04  A little bit.
4684.92 4685.92 SPEAKER_04  It does kind of...
4685.92 4686.92 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, it's only got a little one.
4686.92 4687.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
4687.92 4688.92 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
4688.92 4689.92 SPEAKER_05  Hmm.
4689.92 4701.92 SPEAKER_05  Well, you gotta think about it, it's like, all that they had to do for that part of the movie was make it so that the Dice Factory, like, was make it... just like, get into the Dice Factory somehow, and like, sabotage it.
4701.92 4709.92 SPEAKER_05  The fact that it's in Mexico, the whole, like, unionization thing, that was not necessary for the movie, they made that choice, and...
4709.92 4713.92 SPEAKER_05  I don't know, it's an interesting choice to have made, certainly.
4713.92 4716.92 SPEAKER_05  I feel like part of the joke is, haha, Mexico.
4716.92 4717.92 SPEAKER_03  It is, yeah.
4717.92 4718.92 SPEAKER_03  Maybe, yeah, yeah, certainly.
4718.92 4729.92 SPEAKER_04  And like, on the one hand, it's like, dependent on, like, kind of, reducing Mexico to a kind of, like, extractive labor colony of the United States, but that's also, like, that is one of the things that Mexico is.
4729.92 4739.92 SPEAKER_05  It's like, you as a white person can go to Mexico and be like, you have forgotten the spirit of Zapata, and like, fire the wall up or something like that.
4739.92 4740.92 SPEAKER_05  You can't...
4740.92 4741.92 SPEAKER_05  Don't do that.
4741.92 4750.92 SPEAKER_04  There is an aspect of, kind of, like, subsuming critique here as well, in that, like, there's a reveal that we didn't really talk about that I kind of wanted to.
4750.92 4755.24 SPEAKER_04  Where they're in the hotel room and they're like, well, what's the holdup with this strike?
4755.24 4759.90 SPEAKER_04  And they've been talking about stealing, like, 500 million dollars or whatever.
4759.90 4765.14 SPEAKER_04  And it's kind of revealed that the stakes of the strike are, like, $3.50 a week.
4765.14 4766.90 SPEAKER_04  And that's a lot of money to them.
4766.90 4767.90 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
4767.90 4768.90 SPEAKER_04  Right?
4768.90 4770.90 SPEAKER_04  And this is kind of just, like, dropped there.
4770.90 4778.90 SPEAKER_04  And that's an interesting thing to leave in the last movie of your trilogy to be like, oh, you guys are assholes.
4778.90 4784.14 SPEAKER_04  There's, you know, there's a kind of class struggle at work here.
4784.14 4785.14 SPEAKER_04  Mm-hmm.
4785.14 4788.14 SPEAKER_04  And it kind of gestures towards that.
4788.14 4793.14 SPEAKER_04  It doesn't really, like, you know, obviously I'm not mad at it for not being, like, soy Cuba or whatever.
4793.14 4795.14 SPEAKER_04  But, like, I don't know.
4795.14 4797.14 SPEAKER_04  It's a curious thing to acknowledge.
4797.14 4798.14 SPEAKER_04  And I think that's really, like...
4798.14 4799.14 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
4799.14 4800.14 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
4800.14 4803.14 SPEAKER_04  It's not culturally insensitive in itself, but it is...
4803.14 4804.14 SPEAKER_04  It's problematic.
4804.14 4806.14 SPEAKER_04  I feel like it's worse than the last one.
4806.14 4807.14 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
4807.14 4811.14 SPEAKER_03  I feel like part of the joke being it's Mexico is worse than the last one.
4811.14 4813.14 SPEAKER_03  We do have the yellow filter.
4813.14 4814.14 SPEAKER_04  The moustaches.
4814.14 4815.14 SPEAKER_04  The moustaches.
4815.14 4816.14 SPEAKER_04  Not hugely...
4816.14 4822.14 SPEAKER_04  I mean, I am a fan of there's a part of moustache, but I'm not a fan of it being, like, that's your, like, Mexican cover.
4822.14 4823.14 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
4823.14 4824.14 SPEAKER_04  Weaponizing it.
4824.14 4825.14 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
4825.14 4826.14 SPEAKER_04  Three?
4826.14 4827.14 SPEAKER_04  Four?
4827.14 4830.14 SPEAKER_04  I mean, Mr. Weng owns all the air south of Beijing.
4830.14 4831.14 SPEAKER_03  Four.
4831.14 4832.14 SPEAKER_04  Four.
4832.14 4833.14 SPEAKER_04  Four.
4833.14 4834.14 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
4834.14 4835.14 SPEAKER_03  Mm-hmm.
4835.14 4838.14 SPEAKER_04  I am really sick of the untranslated Mandarin thing.
4838.14 4839.14 SPEAKER_05  Although they do...
4839.14 4840.14 SPEAKER_05  Oh, yeah, let me get into this.
4840.14 4845.14 SPEAKER_05  Because, like, the point of that is always to, like, hit the punchline where he says shit in English.
4845.14 4846.14 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
4846.14 4848.14 SPEAKER_05  And, like, you have made the determination at some point that it is...
4848.14 4851.14 SPEAKER_05  That's a better punchline than giving this guy a character.
4851.14 4852.14 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
4852.14 4853.14 SPEAKER_05  Yes, that's true.
4853.14 4854.14 SPEAKER_05  And it isn't.
4854.14 4855.14 SPEAKER_05  I don't want to tell you that.
4855.14 4863.14 SPEAKER_04  There is an implicit thing that is kind of funny which suggests that Bernie Mac is the only one of them who doesn't speak Mandarin, who isn't, like, bilingual English Mandarin.
4863.14 4864.14 SPEAKER_04  That's funny.
4864.14 4865.14 SPEAKER_04  Which is...
4865.14 4866.14 SPEAKER_04  I kind of appreciate that.
4866.14 4867.14 SPEAKER_04  Anyway.
4867.14 4868.14 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
4868.14 4869.14 SPEAKER_03  Four.
4869.14 4870.14 SPEAKER_04  Unprovoked vibes is, like, zero.
4870.14 4871.14 SPEAKER_04  There is none.
4871.14 4872.14 SPEAKER_04  Like...
4872.14 4873.14 SPEAKER_05  They don't, yeah.
4873.14 4879.14 SPEAKER_05  Even the guys that they fuck over, they give them, like, three million dollars at the end of the movie or whatever, and it's all forgiven.
4879.14 4880.14 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
4880.14 4882.14 SPEAKER_04  You've wasted dad Hitler's time.
4882.14 4883.14 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
4883.14 4886.14 SPEAKER_04  But, like, it's not violence to waste somebody's time, and even the most...
4886.14 4888.14 SPEAKER_03  They actually refuse to commit murder.
4888.14 4889.14 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
4889.14 4893.14 SPEAKER_04  They kind of mull it, but it's, like, provoked at that point.
4893.14 4894.14 SPEAKER_05  Like...
4894.14 4895.14 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
4895.14 4899.14 SPEAKER_05  The Night Fox, Red Skeleton pulls out a gun at the end, and it's, like, treated as if, like, it's cheating.
4899.14 4900.14 SPEAKER_05  Hmm.
4900.14 4901.14 SPEAKER_05  It's also revealed to be unloaded.
4901.14 4904.14 SPEAKER_05  Well, yeah, indeed, and the gun turns out to not even be loaded.
4904.14 4915.14 SPEAKER_04  Conversely, Saul does grope Al Pacino for no reason, and, like, just out of nowhere.
4915.14 4916.14 SPEAKER_03  That's true.
4916.14 4917.14 SPEAKER_03  That's violence.
4917.14 4918.14 SPEAKER_04  Some provoke sexual violence.
4918.14 4920.14 SPEAKER_04  It's portrayed as a joke as well.
4920.14 4921.14 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
4921.14 4922.14 SPEAKER_05  Whatever.
4922.14 4923.14 SPEAKER_05  Okay, give it one, then.
4923.14 4924.14 SPEAKER_05  But, like, it can't...
4924.14 4925.14 SPEAKER_05  There's no way it's any...
4925.14 4926.14 SPEAKER_04  It's a strange throwaway joke.
4926.14 4927.14 SPEAKER_04  Misogyny?
4927.14 4930.14 SPEAKER_04  I mean, like, we immediately go, women?
4930.14 4931.14 SPEAKER_04  Fuck em.
4931.14 4932.14 SPEAKER_04  Not in this movie.
4932.14 4933.14 SPEAKER_04  What women?
4933.14 4934.14 SPEAKER_04  We traded them in.
4934.14 4946.14 SPEAKER_04  We traded in to, like, sort of, like, female actors for, like, one female actor in, like, a kind of, like, larger role, but, like, as a kind of, like, villain-ass.
4946.14 4947.14 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
4947.14 4955.14 SPEAKER_04  And it's like, if you're gonna make that explicit and transactional, and it basically is, like, that scene goes, yeah, these two women are not in this.
4955.14 4956.14 SPEAKER_04  This woman is.
4956.14 4957.14 SPEAKER_04  And it's like, man.
4957.14 4958.14 SPEAKER_04  Okay.
4958.14 4960.14 SPEAKER_03  And she is...
4960.14 4961.14 SPEAKER_03  She's there to be seduced.
4961.14 4962.14 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
4962.14 4973.14 SPEAKER_03  Nobody comments on the fact that the manner in which she is seduced is incredibly fucking violating, and, like, probably quite seriously very criminal, even more criminal than, like, stealing the heist.
4973.14 4974.14 SPEAKER_04  Yeah, one might call it...
4974.14 4975.14 SPEAKER_04  Highly illegal.
4975.14 4976.14 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
4976.14 4979.14 SPEAKER_03  It's, like, you know, pretty fucking rapey.
4979.14 4981.14 SPEAKER_03  I'm glad that she doesn't have sex with Matt Damon.
4981.14 4982.14 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
4982.14 4985.14 SPEAKER_03  But even then, like, they're kissing and touching and stuff, and I'm like, that's still pretty...
4985.14 4986.14 SPEAKER_03  That's pretty fucking bad.
4986.14 4988.14 SPEAKER_03  Yeah, she gets humiliated, like...
4988.14 4995.14 SPEAKER_03  She does, and Basher wants the... Basher wants the, kind of, like, roofie patch for himself, and this is played as a joke.
4995.14 4996.14 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
4996.14 4998.14 SPEAKER_03  It's like, that's pretty fucking dark, actually.
4998.14 5000.14 SPEAKER_03  I think it's worse than the last one, and the last one was a four.
5000.14 5006.14 SPEAKER_05  Yeah, the presence of the roofie patch is crazy as a thing to throw in.
5006.14 5007.14 SPEAKER_05  I think that bumps it up.
5007.14 5020.14 SPEAKER_04  They just kind of use, instrumentally, a couple of unnamed hot women as, like, sort of, like, distractions, and they give them some dialogue, but it's so clearly like, ah, give them some dialogue, you know?
5020.14 5021.14 SPEAKER_04  Mm-hmm.
5021.14 5034.14 SPEAKER_04  It's just kind of like, make them seem like we're not just doing misogyny here by being, like, ah, you know, this guy gets in the trailer with a couple of, like, hot girls, and it's like, this is... this is... it's gross, you know?
5034.14 5035.14 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
5035.14 5038.14 SPEAKER_03  It's also, like, as a female actor, it's boring.
5038.14 5039.14 SPEAKER_03  Mm-hmm.
5039.14 5041.14 SPEAKER_03  I'm like, what role would I want to play here?
5041.14 5044.14 SPEAKER_03  And the answer is I wouldn't particularly want to play any of them.
5044.14 5051.14 SPEAKER_03  I mean, it would be fun to play Abigail if only for the name, but even then I'm just like, really? She's being, like, date rape seduced?
5051.14 5054.14 SPEAKER_03  That's what you're doing with your main female character?
5054.14 5055.14 SPEAKER_03  Mm-hmm.
5055.14 5057.14 SPEAKER_03  Is she's humiliated and this is played as a joke?
5057.14 5058.14 SPEAKER_03  She's violated and this is played as a joke?
5058.14 5059.14 SPEAKER_03  I think it's worse than the last one.
5059.14 5060.14 SPEAKER_03  The last one was a four.
5060.14 5061.14 SPEAKER_03  I think...
5061.14 5070.14 SPEAKER_05  They sort of try to justify it as well, because they're like, they introduce this woman being misogynistic herself with the, like, firing the models who serve for being four pounds overweight or whatever.
5070.14 5072.14 SPEAKER_05  Like, I don't like it.
5072.14 5073.14 SPEAKER_05  I don't like it at all.
5073.14 5074.14 SPEAKER_05  No.
5074.14 5076.14 SPEAKER_04  I think it's like, at least a five, you know?
5076.14 5077.14 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
5077.14 5078.14 SPEAKER_03  I could go as high as six.
5078.14 5079.14 SPEAKER_03  I'm just...
5079.14 5080.14 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
5080.14 5081.14 SPEAKER_04  I'm just quite disgusted by that.
5081.14 5082.14 SPEAKER_04  I'm on the borderline.
5082.14 5084.14 SPEAKER_04  I think this is a five, but it's a high five.
5084.14 5085.14 SPEAKER_04  Okay.
5085.14 5086.14 SPEAKER_03  Okay.
5086.14 5087.14 SPEAKER_03  High five!
5087.14 5088.14 SPEAKER_03  High five!
5088.14 5090.14 SPEAKER_03  Alright, that gives it a total score of...
5090.14 5091.14 SPEAKER_03  My pen is running out of ink.
5091.14 5093.14 SPEAKER_03  That gives it a total score of...
5093.14 5094.14 SPEAKER_03  20.
5094.14 5096.14 SPEAKER_03  Which makes it the worst one so far.
5096.14 5097.14 SPEAKER_03  I agree.
5097.14 5098.14 SPEAKER_05  And I think that tracks.
5098.14 5099.14 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
5099.14 5100.14 SPEAKER_05  No, it does.
5100.14 5101.14 SPEAKER_05  The worst one in the main cast list ever, by the way.
5101.14 5102.14 SPEAKER_05  Yeah.
5102.14 5104.14 SPEAKER_05  These are the eight women of Ocean's 8.
5104.14 5105.14 SPEAKER_05  Yes, I'm looking forward to this.
5105.14 5106.14 SPEAKER_05  Right.
5106.14 5107.14 SPEAKER_05  Sandra Bullock.
5107.14 5108.14 SPEAKER_05  Classic, of course.
5108.14 5109.14 SPEAKER_05  Cate Blanchett.
5109.14 5110.14 SPEAKER_05  Hell yeah.
5110.14 5111.14 SPEAKER_05  Anne Hathaway.
5111.14 5112.14 SPEAKER_05  I love her.
5112.14 5113.14 SPEAKER_05  I'm gonna stop reacting to these now.
5113.14 5119.14 SPEAKER_05  Mindy Kaling, Sarah Paulson, Aquafina, Rihanna, and Helena Bonham Carter.
5119.14 5120.14 SPEAKER_05  Oh, what an insane fucking list!
5120.14 5121.14 SPEAKER_03  Whipped it at the end!
5121.14 5122.14 SPEAKER_03  Whipped it at the end!
5122.14 5123.14 SPEAKER_02  Oh no!
5123.14 5124.14 SPEAKER_03  Oh, I don't wanna watch it now!
5124.14 5135.14 SPEAKER_04  I'm excited to see Rihanna in another movie after Battleship, which is a real cinematic exit.
5135.14 5136.14 SPEAKER_03  2018!
5136.14 5137.14 SPEAKER_03  Hell in a bon, really?
5137.14 5138.14 SPEAKER_03  What else has Aquafina been in?
5138.14 5139.14 SPEAKER_03  She was still around, yeah.
5139.14 5140.14 SPEAKER_04  What else has Aquafina been in?
5140.14 5141.14 SPEAKER_05  It's a real, like, kind of, sinner to nerdle question.
5141.14 5142.14 SPEAKER_05  Not good.
5142.14 5143.14 SPEAKER_04  It's not good.
5143.14 5144.14 SPEAKER_04  It's not good.
5144.14 5145.14 SPEAKER_04  It's not good.
5145.14 5146.14 SPEAKER_04  It's not good.
5146.14 5147.14 SPEAKER_04  It's not good.
5147.14 5148.14 SPEAKER_05  I'll say that.
5148.14 5149.14 SPEAKER_05  I'm looking at these now.
5149.14 5152.14 SPEAKER_05  I'm not looking forward to that now.
5152.14 5153.14 SPEAKER_03  Ah, fuck.
5153.14 5168.34 SPEAKER_04  Well, Oceans 8 is the next one where we're getting really into the, like, we've had the kind of insincere, uh, you know, watch Oprah and get in touch with her feelings and still be pretty misogynistic era.
5168.34 5172.34 SPEAKER_04  We're now about to get into insincere for girls.
5172.34 5173.34 SPEAKER_04  Yeah.
5173.34 5175.34 SPEAKER_05  I can't fucking wait.
5175.34 5178.34 SPEAKER_05  I can't wait to hear everything that girls can do.
5178.34 5179.34 SPEAKER_05  It's gonna be so good.
5179.34 5182.34 SPEAKER_03  They can manufacture it in pastel colors for the ladies.
5182.34 5186.34 SPEAKER_04  I think this is gonna be the most interesting one yet, so please stay tuned for that.
5186.34 5188.34 SPEAKER_03  And they're all cis bullshit.
5188.34 5189.34 SPEAKER_04  Uh-huh.
5189.34 5190.34 SPEAKER_04  Right?
5190.34 5193.34 SPEAKER_04  You're telling me you named eight women and they were all cis?
5193.34 5196.34 SPEAKER_04  This is, if nothing else, statistically improbable.
5196.34 5197.34 SPEAKER_04  Like...
5197.34 5198.34 SPEAKER_03  Yeah.
5198.34 5199.34 SPEAKER_03  And straight?
