Can't you stay to the point, General?
Well, I'm sorry.
If the pilot's good, see, I mean, if he's really sharp,
he can barrel that baby in solo.
I mean, you ought to see it's a big plane, like a 52.
It's Jennings off flying tickets in the bar.
Yeah, but has he got a chance?
Has he got a chance?
Hello, welcome. Episode two.
And clearly today we are doing the second part of this seven-part series
of Stanley Kubrick's last seven films from 1964,
Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.
It's got to be the best satire of all time
and just one of the best and most influential movies of all time.
Now, as I said, this is part two of the seven-part series.
If you have not listened to episode one about The Shining,
I would suggest you go back and listen to that if you feel like it
because I will be repeating some ideas here.
But basically, we are looking at these last seven movies of Kubrick
with this kind of thesis of his Gravity's Rainbow,
of a narrative arc kind of painted across these movies,
namely that violence is man's ultimate characteristic,
violence is his crowning achievement,
and violence marks our place and our time in the universe
and that we are born in violence and will end in violence.
And specifically, that America represents this dark star apotheosis
of mankind's violence as the Fourth Reich.
Now, before I get more into these ideas,
I want to explain just two terms that I'm using kind of interchangeably.
One, the dark star, which I kept talking about during The Shining episode.
I'm just using that meaning, kind of the inverse of a star,
the way a star brings light to the universe, which is the source of all life.
The dark star is an idea of something that demands death
and something that demands consumption and death and destruction,
the opposite of that.
You can technically use the term black hole, but dark star sounds cooler.
And I think it's an easy way to paint this picture
and help kind of describe the idea of America that Kubrick was painting.
Second is this idea of the Fourth Reich.
And I am hijacking this from my brother, Michael Judge,
and his excellent podcast, Death is Just Around the Corner.
So apologies for that.
But it's an idea we've talked about a lot.
And just the idea of America representing this kind of apex of man's violence,
especially post-World War II and especially post-JFK assassination
and the CIA world state that we live in under the guise of America.
But America as the Fourth Reich perfecting violence and implementing fascism,
meaning the politics of violence,
the politics of killing who you want and taking what you want,
within the guise of liberalism and the guise of democracy.
And that is the Fourth Reich, the idea of, again, the empire never ending,
the same arc of violence that has defined man not stopping,
not becoming something of the past with the death of Hitler
or the fall of the Reich or the Marshall Plan,
but something that was only perfected and tweaked and fine-tuned more
to the point where we can't even see it.
And we live either knowing it with the shining,
seeing the river of blood and going insane,
or ignoring it with our eyes wide shut.
And so this is this kind of gravity's arc
and the thesis kind of of this seven-part series.
And I mean, when we talk about the Reich,
I don't want people to get caught up in specifics.
However, if we're going to talk about America as the Fourth Reich,
I mean, we have to talk about Dr. Strangelove
as specifically the cultural touchstone
and the cultural meme for this idea.
I mean, quite literally, it is named after an Operation Paperclip Nazi
who is guiding the American agenda
into its own destruction and nuclear holocaust.
And of course, we'll get more into this in just a moment,
but it's based off of Peter George's book, Red Alert.
I think it's vital to note that it's named after Dr. Strangelove,
not the missile crisis, not the nuclear fear,
but this Operation Paperclip Nazi
whose plan ultimately comes to fruition.
And you can view it either way through the course of the movie,
either as an endless series of kind of comic satirical mishaps
that leads there,
or as Strangelove sees it, fate.
That either way, when the bombs drop
and the demon escapes and Strangelove's Nazi hand comes to life
and he can miraculously walk,
either way the world ends
with an American Nazi-guided nuclear holocaust.
And so we can see, you know, even though it's a satire
and it's, you know, played for comedic value,
Kubrick was working on this idea of America as the Fourth Reich
and America as being secretly guided by a Nazi agenda
as early as 1964, which, you know, we'll get into,
but just the psychedelic prescience of this movie
is mind-blowing still and unbelievable and kind of scary.
But Dr. Strangelove, of course, you know,
Kubrick's been not totally forthcoming about who it's based on
or if it's based on anybody.
But a lot of people, you know, suppose that it's based on
Wernher von Braun, the Nazi rocket scientist
who was literally part of Operation Paperclip
and became, you know, started working for the American government
after World War II.
And people probably know this.
People probably know everything I'm saying.
I'm not discovering new ground.
But I just found a quote in that Stanley Kubrick archives book,
again, edited by Alison Castle,
which I'm pulling a ton from for this.
You should go read that if you're interested in this series.
The quote from Wernher von Braun,
just very short and simple and to the point.
He said,
This time I wanted to be on the winning side.
I mean, come on.
That's almost saying it.
That's very close to being like, you know,
this time America won.
America's winning the Reich battle.
And I want to be in the American Reich.
So you can see this idea of America as the Fourth Reich
and mankind being defined by and ultimately doomed
in his own penchant for violence and bloodlust.
Present as early as 1964.
And of course, this is the first of these last seven movies
that we're going to watch.
And you can really see the break in both Kubrick's career
and the cultural psyche in this movie.
I think you can really trace from, you know,
Fear and Desire, his first picture to Eyes Wide Shut.
You can really trace the American consciousness
kind of going from pre to postmodern.
And I've always thought it kind of exploded psychedelically
with Dr. Strangelove.
And both Kubrick and cinema
and the world culture was never the same after it.
But before we get into, obviously,
the overarching thesis of this series
and the idea of America as the Fourth Reich,
it's very interesting to look at how this movie came about
in the first place.
As I said, it's an adaptation of Peter George's novel Red Alert,
which was a very serious thriller
in earnest about the nuclear crisis.
Kubrick had gotten the contract or the option
to adapt that to a film and was working on it.
And at the same time,
another nuclear crisis movie called Failsafe came out
and it kind of stole their thunder.
And Kubrick had to go back and figure out
how to make this script work.
There's a quote from the man himself from that time.
He said,
I found that in trying to put meat on the bones
and to imagine the scenes more fully,
one had to keep leaving things out
which were either absurd or paradoxical
in order to keep it from being funny.
And these things seem to be close
to the heart of the scenes in question.
And more or less, as he went,
he kept realizing this is a comedy.
This is a satire.
This is a movie about people
whose penchant for bloodlust has caught them up
and conquest has caught them up in such insane paranoia
that it leads them to their own ridiculous
and pointless destruction,
which of course is caused by only themselves.
I think it's both a vital moment in Kubrick's career
and a vital moment in American culture
and the kind of leap to postmodernism
and self-aware art
that Kubrick realized the best way to tell this story
was as a satire because it's fucking ridiculous.
And I think from there you can really see him
and Terry Southern took a serious work
and made it this incredible,
greatest fucking satire of all time.
I think you can really see Kubrick's
dark sense of humor form there
and really see, as we talked about in episode one,
that whole melody, chords, plot world dynamic
start to take shape
where his movies from then on all tell two stories.
There's one story it shows
and there's one story it tells
and they all work on two levels.
It goes from the kind of pre-modern,
earnest movie like Killer's Kiss
or even The Killing,
which has lots of thematic material and motifs,
but is fairly an earnestly straightforward told story.
And suddenly, you know,
the Strangelove, it's like Sgt. Pepper's.
It's like a psychedelic postmodern experience
that suddenly nothing was the same afterwards.
You know, even from the subtitle on the movie
of How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,
you realize we're in new territory here.
You realize this is a director
working ironically and satirically
and expecting his audience to go along with him.
The idea of stop worrying and love the bomb.
I mean, once again, we're talking about the Fourth Reich.
We're talking about embracing this idea
of America's self-perceived manifest destiny of violence
and that if we drop nuclear bombs on people,
it's got to be justified
because we're the good guys.
And you got to just stop worrying
and love this place we're going,
love this way we're going,
the direction we're going.
And it's very interesting that
love appears twice in the title.
Dr. Strangelove, of course,
an adaptation of
in loving the bomb.
There's this strange love
that this Nazi brings,
this strange idea of love
and of how mankind could survive
through this incredibly pointless nuclear holocaust
that just happens to accomplish
the Nazi goals of global eugenics.
You know, we'll get there in the commentary,
but we're so used to it now.
We've so lived in a world
with ironic postmodern self-aware art
that it's still just incredible to see.
In 1964, starting with the planes fucking in midair,
the plane refueling the other one,
but it obviously being scored sexually
to try a little tenderness,
to the end when the bombs drop,
the earth is consumed in nuclear fire,
and Vera Lynn's We'll Meet Again plays.
In that moment, it's like,
we're right there in the postmodern.
This is Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.
This is your first hit of acid
where your brain wakes up
and culturally nothing's the same.
You know, instead of scoring
everyone's worst fear at the time,
nuclear war,
dramatically or mournfully,
he plays this winking pastoral pop song,
you know, that's suggesting
we will all meet again
up in the heavens
as human beings reduced to rays of light
in a cloud of nuclear fallout.
That is just,
that's fucking unbelievable for 1964.
And you can see a clear delineation
from that point on in Kubrick's work
and then obviously the culture
that it influenced.
And of course, you know,
the way this movie,
again, is the original cultural touchstone
for Operation Paperclip Nazis.
Dr. Strangelove is a meme,
meaning a Nazi hiding in the American midst.
You know, he's working on this idea
as early as 1964,
and the movie ends up being horribly,
kind of fucking cosmically prescient.
And, you know, famously,
Kubrick, as we talked about in part one,
left America during the making of this movie
and never came back.
And we talked about, obviously,
in The Shining,
why I think that is
and what he came to see America is.
I mean, that's what this whole
fucking series is about, right?
But he did discover a lot of things
and did have some interesting interactions
with the government
during his research on Strangelove
and did feel something watching over him
and something taking notes.
And the prescience that he shows
in the script and the movie
and what it's about
and his kind of ideas of humanity
and where it's going
and then the way it's kind of horribly played out.
We'll get into that, obviously,
in specifics here in a second.
But you start to see the seeds planted
in Strangelove as early as 1964
of how he viewed America
and how he viewed this Gravity's Rainbow arc
of mankind and his violence.
So before we get into the commentary
and the specifics of the movie,
I just want to talk about a few stories
from the production
that kind of inform, again,
this idea of America
and why Stanley may have left.
Obviously, a big part of the movie
takes place in a B-52,
the bomber that drops the bombs
that starts the chain reaction
of the doomsday machine.
And Air Force personnel
during the production of the movie
were invited to the set
and were shocked
at how accurate the B-52 cockpit was.
The next day, Kubrick got word
that there would possibly be
an investigation by the FBI.
So immediately,
while he's making his movie
about American paranoia
leading to our violent and horrible deaths,
they take one look at the set
and he's informed
that he may be under investigation
by the government.
So much for that paranoia idea
being outlandish or far-fetched.
And then famously,
a lot of you probably know this already,
but the original first screening
for Dr. Strangelove
was scheduled for November 22, 1963.
And there is a line in the movie
as they're reading,
Slim Pickens is reading out the list,
the inventory of the evacuation kits
to all the soldiers over the radio
and the B-52.
He reads, I can't remember what it is,
it's lipstick, nylon,
basically, clearly,
a bunch of items
where you could disguise yourself
as a woman if you had to
in a drop zone,
in enemy territory.
And Slim Pickens, in the movie,
he stops and says,
well, a fella could have
a pretty good weekend in Vegas
with all that stuff.
Well, the original line was,
a fella could have
a pretty good weekend in Dallas
with all that stuff.
And if you watch the movie,
the line is dubbed,
you can see Slim Pickens' mouth,
he says Dallas,
in the take, in the movie.
They had to dub it,
obviously, to Vegas afterwards
because Kennedy was killed in Dallas.
And then, of course,
there's a famous,
there was supposed to be a pie fight
in the war room
near the end of the movie.
And they filmed it and everything
and Kubrick ended up cutting it
and thought it didn't work.
But in the scene,
President Merck and Muffley,
of course,
played by the god Peter Sellers
in the god performance,
three completely different
and perfectly drawn characters.
Merck and Muffley gets hit by a pie
and General Turgis,
played by the other god,
George C. Scott,
in the other god role in this movie,
he says,
gentlemen,
our gallant young president
has been struck down in his prime.
So again,
a movie about
American paranoia
and bloodlust
leading to America eating itself.
Made in 1963
before the JFK assassination,
there's just a horrible
little cosmic prescience there
that came true.
And again,
you paint that
or lead that
to the fuller picture
of Kubrick
then leaving America
and never coming back.
It adds a little weighted
significance.
But then the story
from the production
that a lot of people
don't know
unless they have this specific DVD
that I have
with the behind-the-scenes documentary.
I'm going to quote this story
from Dee Taylor,
the wife of
the director of photography
for this Gilbert Taylor.
They were with
the second unit crew
that was tasked
with getting the aerial footage
for the background
of the B-52 shots.
So they had a large plane
that said Dr. Strangelove
on the side
and their job
was to fly around
to the most remote
and desolate places
in the world
that could stand in
for Siberia
which of course
this movie's taking place
at the height
of the Cold War.
So they had to go
to the most icy remote
mountains they could find
in the world
and shoot a stand-in
for Siberia
as Major Kong
and the B-52
is making its approach
towards its bombing target.
So Dee Taylor
tells this story
on the DVD.
She says,
When we were flying
across Greenland
and then into Iceland
we accidentally flew
across a secret
American base.
We had no idea
because we were
in the mountains you see
and suddenly two
American fighters
came up on either
side of us
and they waggled
their wings
and they told us
to go down like this.
The pilots did this
pointing down
saying,
Go down.
We couldn't see
anywhere to land.
It was just an ice field.
And so we came down
and the pilot said,
Everybody lie on the floor
because I will have
no breaks.
And it took an awful
long time before we stopped.
We were very close
to the edge of the field
by the time we finished.
So the Americans
were all there
covered in the huge
Arctic foxtails
and everything
and they thought
we were spies
because it said
Dr. Strangelove
across the plane.
They thought
we were Russians.
So Stanley Kubrick
in the middle
of his making
his movie again
about the American
paranoia and penchant
for bloodlust
leading to its own
self-caused destruction.
He literally had
the second unit
fly to the remotest
part of the globe
he could find
to get aerial footage.
And of course
he flew over
a secret US military base
that was there.
You know,
while making that movie,
while making that movie,
specifically again
about an American
Nazi-led government
stumbling into
nuclear holocaust
out of extreme
paranoia and fear.
While he was making
that movie
and he went to
the farthest reach
of the globe
he could find,
way above the clouds,
two American fighter jets
come up
and force them to land
and nearly run them
off the edge of a mountain.
I mean,
people wonder
why Stanley Kubrick
left America
and never came back.
I think that
should show you.
You know,
if you're already
working on the idea
of America
as the Fourth Reich
and you're already
working on this idea
of violence
being the overarching
and defining
characteristic of man
that marks his place
among the stars
and you want to go
shoot your movie
about it
and you go to
the remotest part
of the globe
and they're there
and they find you
immediately.
Yeah,
no shit,
he never came back.
So anyway,
I think that's a good
overview
and a good place
to start
in understanding
how Dr. Strangelove
is really the kicking
off point
for this picture
of America
as the Fourth Reich,
as the apex
of man's violence
by Kubrick
over his last
seven films.
So I think
with that said,
this is as good
a time as any
to get into
the commentary.
Let's run it.
So Dr. Strangelove,
how I learned
to stop worrying
and love the bomb.
And of course,
it starts with a warning
from the U.S. military
and government
that this could
never happen.
And as we'll get
into later,
that's bullshit.
And they knew
it was bullshit.
And then of course,
the movie,
the first shot
opens up
with these
second unit aerial shots
flying over Iceland
and that story
we just ended
the overview with.
Just imagine
in this first shot
of the movie,
two American fighter jets
popping up
over that cloud cover
where all you can see
is clouds and mountains
and suddenly,
boom,
they're there.
So right from the first shot,
the scene is set.
And now we talked
a lot about
the context of this
and how it fits
into this idea
of the arc of violence
and America
as the Fourth Reich.
And that's all well and good,
but I'd be totally remiss
to not,
in this commentary,
talk about how fucking
funny this movie is.
It's,
it's,
you know,
as we talked about
before in the Shining episode,
Kubrick is extremely funny.
His writing
and his sense of timing
is extremely funny
and it's often,
you know,
deeply ironic.
This is obviously
his,
his,
his on the nose
or,
you know,
on the surface comedy.
And it's insane
how well it stands up
as of recording this,
what,
60 or 50,
eight years later?
58 years later,
it's still funny.
Man,
movies from 2006
aren't funny anymore.
I mean,
some are,
some are great,
but comedy does not age well
and you can see
the strength of the writing
and obviously
the strength of the concept.
It's just still hilarious
and incredibly enjoyable
to watch.
So,
of course,
as we start
with the plain fucking scene,
as we discussed earlier,
there's,
there's a whole theme
about libido
and about the sex drive
specifically of,
you know,
these American men
being converted
to a death drive
and a,
a,
a source of violence
and death
and annihilation
instead of,
you know,
what God intended
the sex drive
to be the source
of human life.
We'll get into that
more later.
But as we watch
this beautiful
plain fucking scene,
I think,
you know,
I'll get more to this,
more into this
at the end
with the,
we'll meet again sequence,
but again,
it's like,
bam,
we're right here
in the postmodern.
We're right here
with a,
you know,
people have done
visual jokes
and ironic material before,
but we're right here
in the melody chords dynamic.
We're right here
and he's showing one thing,
just standard stock footage
of US military planes,
you know,
refueling each other
in the air
and he's telling you
another thing
with the music.
That's the thing
and it just constantly
impresses me
watching this movie
and I'll try not to just
keep repeating it,
but how ahead of its time
it was
and how self-aware it is,
you know,
it's starting off
with this joke
and presuming that
the audience will get it
and they did
and once again,
you can see
why this was such
an important movie
and what a change
of the guard it was.
But as we watch
these beautiful planes
fucking to try
a little tenderness,
let's talk for a second
and go over the names
used in this movie.
We talked in The Shining
about how Kubrick
likes to leave clues
with the names
and have the names
mean something
and this is obviously,
you know,
the apex of that
and the completely
cheeky
and satirical
and funny use of names.
So, of course,
we have General Jack D. Ripper,
which I don't need
to explain,
but he starts,
you know,
the end of the world
out of Cold War bloodlust
because he couldn't
get hard.
And apparently,
this character
was very much based
on the head
of Strategic Air Command,
General Curtis LeMay,
who, quote,
never met a bombing plan
he didn't like.
You can see
the parallel
of Jack D. Ripper
and the real Jack the Ripper
being, you know,
a psychosexual
serial killer.
And then we have
Captain Mandrake,
I guess,
probably the only
reasonable character
in the movie.
And Mandrake
is, of course,
a root that
in mythic lore
is said to
encourage fertility.
So,
for the one
reasonable character,
I guess the suggestion
is that his dick works.
And it's,
this movie's full of
either impotent men
or, or
guys who's,
as they say
in The Departed,
oh yeah,
it's working
over time.
This is
specifically
Buck Turgidson.
And of course,
let's get to him next.
Buck Turgidson.
Buck,
a term for
male of the species.
And Turgidson,
you know,
obviously based off
the word turgid,
meaning swollen.
So he's basically
a giant walking boner
who wants to fuck,
aka bomb,
everything that moves.
And as you see,
clearly we're working
with this
death drive
American libido here.
And then of course
we have
President Merkin
Muffley.
Obviously a Merkin
is a pubic wig
and Muffley
is obviously
muff.
The inverse
of this
American death drive
that the president
is both
a pussy
and a haircut.
You know,
a public facing,
what do they call
a haircut,
the guy they put
on TV.
And it's
very funny
because
he's the one
character that
Sellers plays
as bald.
It's great.
And then of course
the soldier
that brings
Mandrake in
and tries to arrest
him is
Batguano.
Obviously bat shit.
He's bat shit insane.
And then finally
of course
Dr. Strangelove.
I think it's from
his original name
was Merwerktigliebe.
Obviously it's like
a direct translation
of Merwerktigliebe.
But we talked
earlier about
strange love
and the strange love
that he brings
to this world
and the idea of
his fantasy
of reproducing
for a hundred years
with a race
of eugenic concubines.
That's the strange
love he plans
for us.
And to get there
we have to have
the sexual eruption
of global nuclear
holocaust.
And once again
as we get going
this is obvious
but the casting
I mean Peter Sellers
all time great
in this movie.
George C. Scott
all time great.
And it's very funny
you know if you're
a big old movie fan
you would already
know this.
But it's very funny
the casting of both
Hayden Sterling
and George C. Scott
because they're both
kind of playing
satirical
ironic versions
of characters
they got famous
for playing.
Obviously Sterling
Hayden is like
kind of the
Liam Neeson
of the 40s
and 50s
the Taken
era Liam Neeson
you know
tough old bastard
who's gritty
so for him to play
that character
but as a
you know
psychosexual serial killer
because his dick
can't get hard
and wants to bomb
the whole world
just incredible cast
and once again
self-aware
fucking
art from Kubrick
and self-aware casting
that the audience
at the time
would have laughed
and then I always
think it's hilarious
you know George C. Scott
this is again
you know a satirical
and ironical version
of a lot of the tough
bad guys
or you know
hard guys he played
but I always think
it's very funny
that what
seven years
eight years after this
whenever Patton was
that he got an Oscar
for playing Patton
it's very funny
and again
very telling
of this America
that Kubrick saw
right through
from the beginning
that George C. Scott
was given an Oscar
for basically playing
the serious version
of Buck Turgidson
basically the
un-self-aware version
that's perfect
and of course
this has been written
and talked about a lot
but I won't go back
into it
but famously
George C. Scott
hated this performance
when he first saw it
because Kubrick
would have him do
extra outlandish takes
he would play it
kind of closer
to the bone
and more reasonable
and not ridiculous
and then Kubrick
would ask him
to go all out
for a take or two
at the end
and those ended up
being of course
inevitably
all the takes
that Kubrick used
so he hated it
but it ends up
you know becoming
one of the greatest
physical comedy
performance of all time
every single line
is emphasized
almost like he's a mime
but with this
incredible
yeah just
physical control
he leans into every line
he pushes his face
and his mouth
and his arms
and
that fucking scene
where he tumbles
over the chair
is just
as good as any
Buster Keaton
Charlie Chaplin
he's incredible
in this
and one last note
about the casting
of course Slim Pickens
plays Major Kong
again another name
where it's obviously
the King Kong parallel
this giant monster
that's gonna blow up
the building
or the world
and Kubrick
loved working
with Slim Pickens
basically sounded like
he took direction great
he nailed it
in one or two takes
and he would just
work hard
and say yes sir
he basically
sounds a lot like
the character he's playing
and
you know
the character
only
a soldier
could be dumb enough
and
you know
brainwashed enough
to press the big red
in the world button
because someone told him to
because someone told him
that was the right thing to do
and
it sounds like Pickens
did a great job
of
following orders
and not complicating things
Kubrick referred to
he was talking about
Bat Guano
and he said
Bat Guano
is brainwashed
by his conditioning
about the sanctity
of private property
that's why
the
coke scene
he's willing to arrest
the guy
while he's trying
to save the world
but it's an interesting
note with Kubrick's casting
I always thought
it was the same thing
we'll get into this
obviously in the
Barry Lyndon episode
but kind of with
Ryan O'Neill
and Barry Lyndon
that Kubrick would
cast people
I don't know
how to say this
not offensively
Kubrick would cast
people who I think
he thought
their kind of
aptitude
of the material
was right
for the character
basically
like I think
Ryan O'Neill
and Barry Lyndon
thinks he's
I think he thinks
it's a movie
about the most
aggrieved man
in the world
and that's how
he plays it
which is perfect
for the character
and similarly here
Pickens plays Kong
like the most
unflinching
unquestioning
brainwashed
American soldier
which is obviously
perfect
that's the only guy
who would have
no internal monologue
about pushing
the big red
in the world button
and of course
now we go to
Burpleson Air Force Base
where General Jack D. Ripper
calls Mandrake
and tells him
to put it on
condition red
that it's go time
for the war
and of course
from the first shot
Kubrick has
Ripper just
chomping on a big
giant cigar dick
he's just constantly
putting large
phallus shaped
things in his mouth
in this movie
and it's very funny
and then of course
the great
piece is our
profession
poster behind
Mandrake and Ripper
as they talk about
starting the maneuver
that will end the world
and then we get
to the B-52
sequence
and I love that
Kubrick scores
all the sequences
in the B-52
with what is it
Johnny
Johnny comes
marching home
when Johnny
comes marching home
which is obviously
when the ants
go marching in
I love the obviously
once again
a great ironic
music usage
and you know
it's both this
this triumphant
civil war song
about Johnny
coming home
from the war
which of course
ironic
because none
of them
are ever
going to come
home
because they're
going to end
the world
and also
the parallel
that they're
ants
they're part
of a hive
they're kind
of brainless
workers
that just
keep going
and don't
realize
what they're
doing
once again
we talked
about in
the Shining
episode
but Kubrick
ushered in
the era
of soundtracking
movies instead
of scoring
them
and obviously
a huge impulse
for that
was to be
able to use
ironic music
in this movie
basically every
song uses
ironic
and once
again just
a note
of how
we're leaping
into the
postmodern
here in
1964 with
Kubrick
you know
once again
we talked
about how
this podcast
is for freaks
who watch
a movie
20 times
it took me
so many
times watching
this movie
to notice
that in
this first
B-52
scene
Major Kong
is looking
at a playboy
that features
Miss Scott
General
Turgensen's
mistress
it's both
hilarious
it's both
hilarious
that this person
who in
theory is
involved
somehow
in the
defense
state
because she
knows all
the generals
who call
George C.
Scott in the
next scene
she knows
everybody
and is clearly
fucking
multiple of
them
she's clearly
a Washington
D.C.
star fucker
it's very funny
that she's also
the playboy
model
and also funny
that there's
one female
character in
this movie
and she's
only shown
in her
lingerie
in a sexy
scene
in the
bedroom
after her
intergency
presumably
just had
sex
and she's
a playmate
there's a
nice comment
there on
the death
drive
libido
as we
talked about
and for
men
so desperate
to satisfy
their libido
and define
themselves
by their
libidinous
conquerors
that women
themselves
are kind
of unimportant
and interchangeable
it's very
funny
so then we
go to
obviously
them
getting
the first
message
from
Burpleson
Air Force
Base
and we
get all
these shots
of the
B-52
cockpit
and the
nuclear
launch code
process
that of
course
got Kubrick
threatened
with an
FBI
investigation
because of
how accurate
they were
but this
is the
first time
we see
CRM
114
CRM
114
it is the
radio
discriminator
I guess
I don't know
what the hell
I'm talking
about
but it is
the piece
of equipment
that malfunctions
that leads
to
global
nuclear
annihilation
that they
can't get
the
return
call
after the
first call
is sent
out
to
do
wing
plan
attack
R
but if
you're a
Kubrick
fan
or a
Coen
Brothers
fan
as they've
made
references
to it
in their
movie
you probably
already know
about
CRM
114
before I
go too
crazy
in depth
with it
it is
the radio
discriminator
in this
movie
that
malfunctions
that causes
nuclear
holocaust
it is
serum
114
the serum
that the
state gives
Alex to
pacify him
in a
clockwork
orange
it is
CRM
114
is on
one of
the escape
pods
in 2001
which
Dave uses
to violently
explode his
way back
onto the
ship
to kill
hell
which
you know
signifies
the end
of mankind
in his
journey of
evolution
in that
movie
and
supposedly
this one's
debated
and I
need to
look again
but supposedly
you can see
in the
background
and eyes
wide shut
that
Amanda
the model
who
supposedly
overdoses
and we'll
get to
all of
this
is in
wing
C
room
114
in that
movie
so anyway
it's this
both this
cheeky nod
from Kubrick
and this
idea that
something so
small
and bureaucratic
as you know
this little
nomenclature
three letters
and three
numbers on
a paper
could be
a huge
signifier
of the
dark star
and perfectly
American
too
perfectly
American
for these
bureaucratic
office people
who are
out there
controlling
and dominating
and killing
the world
and not to
belabor the
point once
again
but Slim
Pickens
Major Kong's
speech
about the
boys
if this
thing turns
out to be
half as
important
I'd say
you're all
in line
for some
important
promotions
just
it's great
that Kubrick
gave a speech
to a character
that has no
self-reflection
or internal
monologue
about being
asked to
start nuclear
holocaust
this movie's
so good
I have to
keep myself
and just
be like
man this
seems great
but I don't
have much
to say
it's hard
to say
anything new
about Dr.
Strangelove
but I just
want to
comment on
George C.
Scott's
entrance
in the hotel
bedroom scene
turgid's
entrance
and the
belly slap
he does
on the
phone
just perfect
just a
perfectly
drawn
character
that's so
thoroughly
well done
and obviously
with Miss
Scott
answering the
phone as we
talked about
before
I think it's
clear that
she's
fucking all
the generals
or whoever
can help her
get ahead
in DC
she clearly
knows them
and is
clearly has
some position
within the
world
but it's
once again
just self-aware
and funny
to play it
as you know
this playboy
sexy vixen
you know
tell them
to call them
I think
I think
there's something
wrong with the
base
he suggests
you call
General Ripper
and an accurate
comment too
that
the threat
of nuclear
holocaust
will not
disturb
these people's
way of life
up until
the very end
they'll keep
living the way
they want to
live
and Sterling
Hayden
in this next
scene
talking about
the commie
and how
he may
come
dressed as
your own
fellow soldier
it's so good
he's such
the right
character
to portray
the face
of US
Cold War
paranoia
as opposed
to Major
Kong
this is a
character
who does
have
an internal
monologue
and self-reflection
he just never
questions if he's
wrong
he's clearly
driven so insane
by paranoia
he's built
a world
where
if it looks
like
they're fellow
US soldiers
that you know
asking you
to stop
well they're
they're commie
spies
this is
clearly
they've been
commie spies
the entire
time
clearly
I could
never
there's never
a wrong
answer for
Jack D.
Ripper here
as I watched
this first scene
with Mandrake
and Ripper
in the room
together
again I can't
say anything
new about
how unbelievable
how godly
talented
Peter Sellers
is
and this
this movie
may be
the
it's one
of the
single best
displays
of an
actor's
talent
obviously
three
fully
drawn
completely
different
and completely
hilarious
and completely
just perfectly
acted
characters
Mandrake
we'll get
to it
but there's
a scene
in this
that makes
me fucking
die
every time
but
you know
a lot
of people
may know
Peter Sellers
was one
of the only
if not
the only
actor
Kubrick
ever let
improvise
in his
movies
he improvised
a lot
in Lolita
and in this
as well
and
I've always
thought
you can
just see
how much
respect
Kubrick
had for him
and his
talent
through that
and him
giving this
platform
him recognizing
just how
godly talented
he was
and giving him
this platform
in this movie
is awesome
I'm trying
to keep
this from
quickly
becoming
the Chris
Farley
show sketch
which is
like
remember
that
that was
awesome
but
the first
time
when Ripper
asks him
for a
drink
made of
grain
alcohol
and rain
water
obviously
that ties
into the
plot
later
but you
don't know
it at
the time
it's so
fucking
funny
just the
hardest
manliest
thing
you can
possibly
drink
while he's
chomping
on this
giant
cigar
dick
just
absolute
king
shit
and of course
relating back
to the overarching
theme
we're talking
about
and how
this is
the first
of
the glimpse
of America
as the
fourth
Reich
through the
eyes
of Kubrick
obviously
it's vital
to note
that
Ripper's
plan
has no
possible
other outcome
and that he
specifically
backs
the military
into a
position
where there's
no other
possible choice
and that's
exactly what
they want
it's this
great
you know
it's played
seriously
with
Starling
Hayden
and his
tough
gritty guy
voice
but it's
this great
self-acknowledgement
moment
and then with
the whole
libido
theme
it's this
whole
group of
guys who
would never
want this
and absolutely
not
and they're all
pretending that
this is not
what they want
and all secretly
knowing we all
want to join up
and fuck the
world to death
together
and obviously
I'm saying
nothing new
once again
here but
the war room
set is amazing
and very cool
that in a
kind of
straightforward
black and
white movie
that's mostly
it's almost
theatrical
it's mostly
scenes of
people talking
that it's still
very visually
impressive
you know
all his first
movies before
Strange Love
were all
visually impressive
he's obviously
like we talked
about he's
he was a
master photographer
famous for
photography
or at least
well known
and well
respected for
photography
before becoming
a film director
so he's always
had visual
flair and style
but one of the
cool things about
Strange Love
as we talked
about this movie
you know
being this kind
of psychedelic
leap into
post-modernism
which of course
then gets
compounded
times a billion
with his next
movie 2001
but it's very
cool that this
you can see
the edges
coming out
you can see
how visually
talented he is
and for you know
a 90 minute
satire that mostly
takes place on
three or four
sets it's still
very visually
impressive
world targets
in mega deaths
right now
obviously we get
into it with the
whole we cannot
have a doomsday
machine gap
the idea that
there are any
targets in mega
deaths that it's
not just a chain
reaction and
what's fucking
crazy about this
movie against
once again we
talked about the
horrific prescience
in 2022 as
Ukraine goes to
war with Russia
we are literally
seeing blue
check think
tank motherfucking
talking heads who
make six to seven
figures a year
parrot talking
points from
general buck
turgidson and
dr strange love
literally being
like well 10
to 20 million
tops maybe 30
million tops
strategic nuclear
warfare has its
uses it's fucking
insane and once
again we'll talk
about that a lot
more in the
outro but the
horrific prescience
Kubrick had and
then watching
America fall into
the pitfalls that
he had foreseen
is a huge
contributing factor
to why he left
America and never
came back
you know it's very
sad that Kubrick's
not alive and I
wish he was but
sometimes I'm glad
he didn't have to
see blue you know
Chelsea Handler
tweeting that we
should nuke Russia
and we'll get into
this a lot more in
clockwork orange the
idea of the omni
ones but the idea
of people who in
Kubrick's work see
the world for what
it is
Turgidson's one of
the best omni ones
in that he's just
a viking at heart
he's just a warrior
and in some ways
the only people he
really respects in
the movie are the
Russians because
they're the other
warriors and this
inevitable flirtatious
lead up to the
libidinous global
death fuck the way
he clearly wants it
and is clearly all
the policies that
have been left to
him only lead up
to this one
solution is great
and George C.
Scott chomping on
his fucking gum
just leaning into
every line is the
perfect guy to
deliver this message
to President
Merkin Muffley the
pussy in the haircut
the fucking scene
where Muffley
chastises Turgidson
and he stuffs the
gum in his mouth
and chews it like
a dejected child
is so funny and
once again watching
it here on silent
with the subtitles
while we do this
commentary something
I never noticed in
my 20th plus viewing
of this movie that
the next general
he turns to when
he's unsatisfied
with General
Turgidson is named
General Face Man
just literally just
a blank alias in a
suit that's good
I really gotta like
start fast forwarding
through this just get
to the parts where
it talks about the
right because this is
turning into the
Chris Farley podcast
but when he he says
he Turgidson gets a
call from Miss Scott
and says I'll be home
soon and then right
forward hangs up
says don't forget to
say your prayers
and hangs up the
phone in hopes no
one noticed
I love what they do
with the phones in
the war room too
the idea that like
people aren't noticing
and you can have a
secret phone call
while you know
we're in the middle
of a nuclear crisis
it's very funny
once again as Turgidson
lays out his plan
to catch them with
their pants down
because we have a
five to one missile
superiority
just another moment
of the horrific
prescience of the
war on terror
and of preemptive
strikes and how
once again this
literal you know
this is a satire
that ends up not
being much of his
fucking satire
as borne out by
the rest of the
20th century that
Kubrick went on to
witness himself
and once again
watch America fall
into all the pitfalls
he foresaw 40 years
50 60 years before
you know it's very
funny and tragic
and incredibly
frustrating to
continually see
General Turgidson's
pop up throughout
American history
and get their way
but that speaks to
again the point
of the character
in this idea of
the arc of violence
and the fourth
reich that that's
the reason General
Turgidson's keep
popping up and
keep convincing us
to go fuck the
world over in
fiery death is
because that's the
job that's what
they're supposed to
do that's there
much like as we
talked about Jack
in The Shining
they are stewards
of power they're
servants of power
and this is what
the power is based
on and once again
just to have
George C.
Scott be the
satirical face
of that it's
just the utter
I don't know
how to say this
without sounding
like a douche
but just utter
perfection of that
is still it's
incredible it's
incredible that this
movie ever got
made and it's
incredible how
perfect it is
now we get once
again to the
scene in the
B-52 where
Major Kong reads
out the inventory
and Slim Pickens
saying Dallas is
dubbed in for
have a good time
in Vegas and
once again it's
just very funny
to watch people
prepare you know
grab nine packs
of chewing gum
for the post
apocalypse now we
get the introduction
of Peter Bull
and his phenomenal
performance as
Alexei the Soviet
ambassador and we'll
get much more into
this later but it
is fascinating that
for you know an
American movie about
Cold War nuclear
crisis at the
height of the Cold
War that Russians
are not vilified it
is decidedly not
anti-Russian and
Alexei you know is
a human as is the
premier Dimitri and
they're clearly mirror
images of each other
Dimitri and
Muffley and that's
why the phone call
which again people
know but was totally
improvised by Sellers
he is improvising
that entire phone
call which just
again it's
unbelievable
well of course I
just like to call
and say hey
he really nailed
you know and Kubrick
really nailed in the
script the the
pettiness of these
people faced when
faced with nuclear
annihilation how
how accurate and how
American like we
said the idea that
their life's not
going to have to
change that they're
you know there's
still time to talk
like this there's
still time to be
these people is
great and I was
going to get into
it later in the
hilarious scene with
the tiny camera at
the end and I'll
mention it again
then but as we
just talked about
you know it's it's
this movie is not
anti-Russian and it
goes to length to
show premier Dimitri
is as much of a
bumbling human fool
as our pussy
president Muffley
and the and that
the Russians are just
as inept and you
know confused as the
American and the you
know eventually the
doomsday machine goes
off not as an act of
retaliation but as a
mistake even that
was very funny and
very self-aware and
very radical for a
you know when there's
still fucking anti-
commie propaganda in
movie theaters and on
your TV in 1964 just
another sign that we're
we're in new territory
here treating them like
humans and makes it
much funnier and also
dark and bleak that you
know despite America
being this fourth
right dark star defined
by Dr. Strangelove
they're going through
all the same shit over
there too the little
lilt in seller's voice
as he says clear and
plain and coming
through fine it's so
fucking funny and it's
great as we said you
know this scene is
improvised and then
later obviously some of
the strange love scenes
are improvised and it's
great if you notice
that Kubrick frames
Peter Boll as the
ambassador in both this
phone call scene and in
later strange love
scenes when they're all
surrounding him in the
wheelchair he frames
Peter Boll right next to
him and you can see
several times Peter Boll
almost laugh throughout
the movie because of the
direction that uh
sellers improvise
improvisation takes he
almost breaks a couple
times especially near the
end but you could just
tell everyone there that
day was witnessing
something special and we
get into the shootout
beginning of the office
shootout with Mandrake and
Ripper and of course
that's nice shooting
there a soldier again
one of the funnier lines
in movie history and
uh obviously we get to
the I first noticed it
in the act of making
love scene and we've
already talked about the
you know this this theme
of libido and the sex
drive as a death drive
but uh you know who
better to play that
straight as Jack D
Ripper the psychosexual
serial killer than
Sterling Hayden and the
comedy uh you know
once again the the
the lack of self
awareness of Hayden
first noticing it during
the act of making love
and of course correctly
deduced it had to be
commie infiltration of
the drinking water
just again a pitch
perfect uh meme moment
that uh I wish we had
paid more attention to
fucking Mandrake get
over here the red
coats are coming
oh man I'm trying so
hard not to just stop
and pause and laugh
at this movie I don't
have a ton to say that
I didn't say thematically
in the intro and the
outro it's just so good
now we get the all-time
pratfall from George C.
Scott and he's got to
look at the big board
I love his obsession
with the big board
that he's got to see the
big board there's a
great you know uh
childlike quality to
turgidson and now we
get the introduction of
Dr. Strangelove and
some 60 years later
this would implant the
idea in my brother's
mind head of America
as the fourth Reich and
we get it in perfect
unbelievably perfect
form and Peter Sellers
is Dr. Strangelove but
it's great obviously from
the first note that he
mentions uh a study
commissioned by the
Blonde Corporation once
again fourth Reich and
these IG Farben
Bland Corporation
these CIA American
Reich companies uh
bridging the gap let's
say between Germany and
America as we
Operation Paperclip
ushered in the
Strangelove's and the
Werner von Braun's and
probably a lot worse
motherfuckers too to
help I mean
Skorzeny and etc etc
etc but uh just the
perfection of the
character of Strangelove
the fact that he's he
has a Nazi hand that is
trying to kill him I
mean I mean that's an
unbelievable idea from
Kubrick it's an
unbelievably perfect
little encapsulated
meme that's the fourth
Reich in one picture is
you know one hand is
shakes your hand and one
hand is a Nazi hand in a
glove that's secretly
trying to kill him and
everybody else and has an
uncontrollable bloodlust that
they all agree to just
kind of ignore
I'm sitting here doing
you know hours long
podcast series about this
idea and Kubrick nails it
in in one little meme of
a character and just one
perfectly self-encapsulated
idea both you know the
barely hidden fourth Reich
and it's just perfection and
also so funny that the Nazi
hand insists on smoking the
cigarette and then it's
constantly ashing all over
and then also that he has a
chart ready to go in his
pocket to tell what's the
half-life of Cobalt Thorium
G and that specific you know
name-dropping of that feels so
so specifically IG Farben you
know trying to pretend that
that's a normal thing that you
would have or a normal thing
that you would even know about
Cobalt Thorium G probably 99
years it's it's just once again
so well done and so good and
once again horrifically
prescient to that strange love
says this can all be accomplished
by a network of supercomputers
at Kubrick as early as 64 and
then obviously knowing the IBM
Nazi Reich story and that
technology has specifically been
tied up with fascism even as back
as even as far back as then even
since then and the idea that
technology would only be used to
further increase the influence and
size and reach and breadth of
information available to the
fascist Dark Star and obviously we
know a huge part of the birth of the
internet was the CIA was Project
Phoenix and you know the way they
were tracking NVA and Viet Cong in
Vietnam and that leading directly to
so many deaths and once again you
know of course IG Farben and these
these Nazi companies and these German
Reich companies that then you know
when partnered with the CIA or were
invested in in the first place by CIA
or American business or as my brother's
uncovering in his new series you know
the American opium trade and all the
bankers and financial institutions
that were directly in bed with these
companies and again help them bridge
the gap between the third and fourth
Reich to make sure they didn't ever
lose their stock and they didn't ever
lose their money in their pedophile
islands and etc etc but it's great and
horrifically prescient that Kubrick
through Strangelove already saw that
we're going to use computers to track
and classify people and obviously just
Strangelove's idea accomplished the goal
of Nazi eugenics and now we actually get
to I first became aware during the
physical act of love scene and the
scene of Mandrake that makes me laugh
every fucking time is when Ripper tells
him you know I love women but I do deny
them my essence and it cuts to sellers
as Mandrake just making misdemented
smiles go yes yes Jack it's just
incredible I can't again there's so many
moments in this movie I can't believe
it's 1964 it's too intelligent it's too
self-aware it's it's just it's
perfection how many times am I gonna
fucking say that and of course to
complete the Jack D Ripper psychosexual
serial killer theme the same way he
denies women his essence and presumably
jerks off all the time he's backed into a
corner and he denies this global holocaust
he has created his essence and he kills
himself there's a nice analog the fact
that he goes in the bathroom and closes
the door it was a nice if you if we're
looking at you know the global death as a
big death drive libidinous impulse then him
killing himself is surely masturbation now
of course after the B-52 is hit or Russian
airspace but survives we get the entrance of
Colonel Bat shit and saying bat guano and
there's just a nice the way we talked
about how this movie comedically presents
themes that are then later echoed
seriously like with the the dark star
death drive being echoed seriously in
The Shining it's nice that Colonel Bat
Guano you know is a joke here and then
later Kubrick makes a very serious movie
about America brainwashing its soldiers
into as he says being conditioned to
protect the sanctity of private property and
then obviously again we see this brainwashed
soldier theme continue with the B-52 crew as
they after they've been hit they realize
they're past the point of no return they
can't get back to the base and they can't
even get to their primary target they could
get to a different target and they're
gonna have to fly extremely low under the
radar and of course none of them say hey
you know what maybe fuck this the the
unwavering unquestioning allegiance obviously
again this is a theme he gets way into in
a much more serious and dark tone in
Full Metal Jacket and here in a satirical
and funny tone but he's still you know 23
years before Full Metal Jacket still
working on the same idea that only people
so brainwashed by the American military
would be capable of doing such things and
not having an internal monologue or self
awareness about them then we get to the
phone scene with Mandrake and Bat Guano
where he of course you know ends up making
Bat Guano shoot the Coca-Cola machine and
again just another perfect little meme that
you know I'll do this but you're gonna have
to answer the Coca-Cola Corporation for
this in the midst of global annihilation the
soldier is again worried about the the
sanctity of private property because it was
conditioning and and that's just a perfect
little meme didn't that didn't that feel
real and you know all the the protests of
2020 and that always felt like the bottom
line was the cops were always there to
protect the buildings that's what was
really happening was they let people get
their anger out and they kill some and
arrest some but the cops were there to
protect the businesses protect the private
property and we get the almost mournful
prayer of thanks from turgidson about
narrowly avoiding the the wings of the
angel of death fluttering over our heads
and the fucking cut to the film noir ass
shot of strange love sitting in the dark
like stroking his hand is just all time
great and turgidson in the scene where
muffly is talking to premiere dimitri on
the phone and they're talking about the 34
planes and 30 have gone offline for splash
downs and they figure out obviously the
one plane still active I mean I'm just
repeating myself here again but like how
perfect George C Scott is and turgidson is
as the meme of the man who will in the
world is an advisor and a servant of power
who is in the middle of a game of chicken
you know telling the president you know
don't don't swerve the car that's exactly
what he wants that's exactly his plan for
you to swerve
isn't that just uh you know horrifically
prescient to the time we're in and to you
know again just a perfect little encapsulative
meme of how a nazi-led american reich and the
foolishness of those involved serving this
this dark star death drive uh isn't that how
the world will probably end and as we'll get to
in the outro you know hopefully not and
Kubrick hoped not and was trying to portray
this message to see that it wouldn't but
uh doesn't it just get proved unfortunately
more prescient every day of course I use it
as the intro but the frying chickens in a
barnyard scene is just god level and again
just a perfect encapsulative meme of this
idea of this libidinous dark star death
drive and how he's so excited about it like
he you almost get the feeling turgidson
wouldn't mind the world ending if he just got to
see it happen you know that that's I guess you
know kind of in indicated in the text of the
movie that it's this big orgasmic climax of this
libidinous death drive and uh as long as you're there
for the big bust who cares what happens after
and of course George C. Scott's cutoff delivery of the
hell yeah it's just it's just all-time good and just
another moment I want to remark on of how
fucking subtle and funny and more biting and incisive and
insightful it is than any comedy we get today any
um you know post Colbert show era uh
liberalistic American comedy is just
we got nothing as good as that and nothing as well
acted and fully drawn as that these days it's it's unbelievable how well this
film holds up as a comedy you know 60 years later and of course you know it
doesn't really need to be said but this this Bombay uh scene uh with the two nukes
with one is high there and one is dear John again just for 1964 just a geniusly
self-aware and kind of post-modern um you know visual joke to people who had seen
you know uh was a fat man and little boy the fact that I even know what America's
pet names for the nukes that we dropped on Japan are and that you all know what
I'm talking about too you know is self-evidence of why this little visual
joke from Kubrick is good and self-evidence also of the horror of the
fourth Reich and the horror of America's the dark star the fact that we would have
pet names for us unleashing the devil upon the world in mechanical nuclear bomb form obviously
is uh you know it's once again it's a satire that's almost not a satire it's a joke that
writes itself because it's already been written in our history now of course we get to
major kong riding high there down into the soviet base one of
the 20 50 100 all-time instantly recognizable Kubrick iconic shots and you know the of the uh
these last seven films we're doing kind of the first one the one that everyone knows and this
just again what a testament to the level of detail that his movies are conceived and executed at that
you know this would become this all-time iconic cinema image the way you know jaws popping out of
the water is or the way uh michael coming out of the bathroom with the gun and the godfather is over
anything you know indiana jones running away from the boulder this is put in those same afi 100 years
of film uh compilations major kong riding high there down into the nuclear holocaust and first of all
just that sentence isn't that proof and just incredible indicative proof of Kubrick working on this idea
again as early as 1964 before anyone with no outside influence just perceiving the world and history
and our role in it this way already at that time and and you know coming up with that image and then
also like i'm saying you know what a testament as we talked about for to the detail this movie was made
at that when the script was written and we talked in episode one how script is king for Kubrick and it's
the it's the spine spinal column in the brain of the movie everything all the organic matter all the
minutes of the movie stem from the script and uh from the moment the script was written he probably
knew to cast slim pickings because the iconic ending final image of this america is a dumb redneck
riding a nuke down into orgasmic libidinous death drive nuclear holocaust and loving every second of it
you know if as we talked about if turgidson has to appear to not want to the world in nuclear death
he's obviously doing a terrible job of it but kong makes turgidson appear you know restrained and
mature and self-control kong is loving every second of the large you know phallus bomb diving down into
the world and creating the big nuclear bust and uh what it just you know as we talked about in episode
one the river of blood that kind of being the iconic you know one of 50 again iconic shots of the shining
kind of the iconic shot defining this idea uh of america and the dark star and the right you can
definitely put major kong riding high there right next to it and you know just in the context as i'm
saying that it just makes me realize um you know i i love kubrick's movies and he is my favorite he's
probably my favorite artist in general and i think his movies are my favorite collection of movies by a
filmmaker but it's interesting you know i i talked about in episode one how i came back to movies during
the pandemic i had seen all these movies as a kid i was a movie snob as a little 14 year old and watched
all of kubrick's movies and i i enjoyed them all and loved some of them but it wasn't until i rewatched
them again kind of going in fresh that it hit me just objectively how great he was because i don't
want this series to just be an obsession with him and how great his shit is and a kind of elitist uh
you know snobby well kubrick is just he's making films at a different level of detail than anyone else
but it is true i mean as a filmmaker to say that last sentence that this man's trying to paint a
picture of america as a forthright and in 1980 he has the image of the river of blood played you know
in earnest in a serious horrific movie and in 1964 he has major kong riding high there into nuclear hell in
a complete satirical uh you know funny scene um who else is doing that you know who else can we say
has dealt with or you know has as as created these iconic images while also dealing with such a profound
issue while also executing it so artfully in genre spanning from complete black satire to complete utter
horror over you know the course of that half of a century that's i don't want this to just be he's
so great because i love him and then me subjectively you know justifying every decision he makes is great
i want to appreciate what these movies are because they're just overwhelmingly incredible and now we get
to strange love's final manifesto again the the scene where the meme of america's the fourth
right is fully drawn and perfected and makes this podcast irrelevant and unnecessary almost you know
60 years later uh but it is just an incredible performance and it is an incredible idea that this
is how kubrick's in 1964 in the height of the cold war this is how his his cold war nuclear uh crisis
movie ends with a nazi spelling out a plan to guide america to the path of nazi eugenics and everyone
in the room listening with rapt attention and agreeing once they find out that basically they can fuck
once they find out that provisions will be made for the elite in this dark star world to
be fed with you know all the concubines they want over the next century they're all down once they see that
and uh what is just perfectly written and acted scene and again you know next time you watch it
you understand uh how how sellers is improvising with the physical comedy and of course this is
again the perfect meme of having a nazi hand that tries to kill you as you talk uh and then watch
ambassador alexi in the background he's trying not to laugh the whole time it's great and just one more
note on the perfectionist movie before we end ending with the nuclear bomb dropping the great demon of
the dark star being unleashed upon the earth in this uh libidinous orgasmic nuclear hellfire
and kubrick's way of expressing that is this this cosmic connection where somehow the demon cures
strange love's broken body and the final lines of his nuclear crisis movie about america and the
nuclear holocaust ending the world is mein fuhrer i can walk i mean again we see an echo of that's a
totally echoed in you know just six years later which is or seven years later which is mind-blowing
too and we'll get there but in clockwork orange the final line of uh an understanding between two friends
again we get back to the fourth reich and this idea of nazism and fascism the in the the dark star
bloodlust existing just under the bloodlust existing just under the face of liberalism and american
democracy and our government and institutions and and american capitalism etc etc i'm watching right now
as he sig heiles and has to force his nazi hand down but again this idea of uh you know mein fuhrer i can
walk mirroring uh uh an understanding between two friends and this idea of you know nazism and fascism and the
politics of the dark star existing just under the face of liberalism it's great that uh america dropping
the nuke you know the final words i'm myn fuhrer i can walk like that is it's unleashed this nazi power
this this fourth reich power that now we've given legs to now it can walk through our horrible interfacing
with the dark star our willingness to drop nuclear bombs on human beings and open up that that hellfire
gate of a pandora's box um through our willingness to do that we now usher in this new era of the
fourth reich and it's again just perfectly encapsulated in a perfect meme moment that uh
makes this podcast irrelevant and unsent unnecessary i would say that except this understanding of his work
is not really talked about or discussed so that's why i'm saying it but uh again just perfection
before real quick before i get to this it's very funny we talked about before this movie was you know
it made at the height of the cold war and goes to lengths to not be anti-russian but it's one of the
funniest scenes in the movie that uh the ambassador does have a camera it's so funny again they're
they're paranoid and hawkish as well and it's a great again a little self-aware uh winking
acknowledgement there at the end that they're just as fucked up as we are and very funny now we finally
get to the ending one of my favorite endings ever with virulence we'll meet again playing over the
nuclear holocaust of the world and as i talked about before i don't need to reiterate but just the
psychedelic post-modern slap in the face that must have been to the audiences that first watched this
in 1964 um you know as we said scoring everyone's worst fear with this pastoral beautiful love song
about how you're going to meet your loved ones again after we die and then using it to score nuclear
holocaust and again suggesting yes we will all meet again and this is how it will happen um is incredible
is so ahead of its time i think changed you know along with a ton of other stuff kubrick is by no
means the only catalyst and a ton of artists working across all different genres and mediums
helped usher us into the you know post-modern self-aware art era and world that we live in now but
this moment just feels like if this moment is like a catapult into that world and then of course his
next movie the end is it was 2001 like i said it's like your first lsd hit where your brain breaks
out of the matrix and wakes up for the first time but this ending montage is just incredible and then
you know it ends with a nuke looking like a second son shout out to roger waters uh it looks like a
second son as vira lynn sings some sunny day and the strings swell and the music concludes and we hear
the beautifully uh you know just curated for us american entertainment big band feel uh obviously
it's a british song but the point remains um it's just incredible it's perfect like the rest of this movie
and uh again a perfectly encapsulated image of this overarching theme of of violence defining man and
violence being where we're born and where we'll end and that's certainly where
dr strange love or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb ends
so there you have it dr strange love the greatest satire of all time that's not really a satire and
to that point to wrap things up here and kind of put it in a larger context i want to read from the
2014 new yorker article titled almost everything in dr strange love was true and i just want to set
this scene and give a little bit of context here in discussing how strange love actually possibly could
have happened and how close we came the article says with great reluctance president eisenhower
agreed to let american officers use nuclear weapons in an emergency if there were no time or means to
contact the president air force pilots were allowed to fire their nuclear anti-aircraft rockets to shoot
down soviet bombers heading towards the united states and about a half dozen high-level american
commanders were allowed to use far more powerful nuclear weapons without contacting the white house first
going on it says aware that this decision might create public unease about who really controlled
america's nuclear arsenal eisenhower insisted that his delegation of presidential authority be kept
secret at a meeting with the joint chiefs of staff he confessed to being very fearful of having written
papers on this matter so we have eisenhower admittedly implementing a policy where people
other than the president could authorize a nuclear strike and again at the height of the cold war sounds like
just a great idea crazy that he wanted to keep it secret he didn't want people to know about it
so then we go on to the kennedy presidency and again quoting from this new york new yorker article
president john f kennedy was surprised to learn just a few weeks after taking office about this secret
delegation of nuclear power continuing kennedy and his national security advisors were shocked not only by
the wide latitude given to american officers but also by the loose custody of the roughly 3 000 american
nuclear weapons stored in europe few of the weapons had locks on them anyone who got a hold of them
could detonate them now before i start talking about jfk you absolutely should go listen to my
brother's death is just around the corner series about the jfk assassination it is a masterpiece and
you will learn an incredible amount of it um but it becomes clear when you study the jfk assassination
that this was a pattern with jfk clearly here he's coming in dismayed at this secret nuclear policy and how
dr strangelove could have happened how somewhere down the line someone could have pressed the big
red button to fire a nuke and it's similar to how dismayed he was to understand how powerful the cia was
of course him firing uh dolus and the other heads of the cia and that directly leading to the jfk assassination
there was clearly a pattern of him discovering how dark and twisted the real passive power behind the public
face lied and then paying the ultimate price for it being sacrificed on the altar of the rising sun
as bob dylan says so then relating this back to strange love and how the idea of jfk being dismayed at
the secret arms of nuclear power behind the smiling face of the american government how does this relate
back to strange love and kubrick and the place it has in his catalog and of course him making strange
love then leaving america and never returning well let's look at a quote from from kubrick himself
talking about jfk around the time of making strange love kubrick said kennedy made a speech where he said
that the world is living under a nuclear sword of damocles which can be cut by accident miscalculation
or madness and in this case of dr strangelove the movie it's cut by madness so you have this idea as
kubrick himself is noting that even jfk even the president is noting that we're in this precipitous
incredibly dangerous moment in human history teething over the edge of nuclear madness and even a
mistake or just pure insane bloodlust could be the end of us all now relating this again back to kubrick
and these last seven films and this overarching idea of violence defining man uh let's look at another
quote from kubrick from his essay how i learned to stop worrying and love the cinema from around the
time of the production of strange love kubrick writes it is often difficult not to have a cynical
view of human relationships but i think that in a subject like this the cynicism should at least try
to serve some constructive purpose it seemed to me that since this is a tragedy which has not yet
occurred any insight which could be provided any sense of reality which could be given to it so that
it didn't seem just an abstraction which the nuclear problem is in most people's minds was really quite
useful this is almost a direct echo of what i said at the end of the first episode about the shining is
that you could view kubrick as deeply cynical deeply pessimistic and even a misanthrope who views humankind
as a waste but i don't think that's accurate what he's instead trying to do is present an honest and
accurate almost alternate history his own history that is not willing to shy away from the fact that
we are and have always been defined by violence now when you look at this quote in the context of
strange love and in the context of his earlier quote i just read about jf even jfk acknowledging the sword
of damocles hanging over with nuclear holocaust over the world i think we can understand even more
perhaps why kubrick left america never came back and why he gained this picture of america you know
i'm speculating on a lot of this and drawing thematically uh from his movies maybe he didn't
he hated flying and he really liked london and he was nice there and he didn't want to go back
but uh i have to think there's a lot more going on with that clearly and you know you can look at
these seven kubrick movies from 1964 to 1999 stanley kubrick saw the world change so much and was part of
of that world changing and he is trying to present this alternate history or this his own trying to
be honest view about history and man's violence and that being the arc of his time here in the universe
he's trying to present this as far back as 1964 with just the utmost prescience and of course satire
and humor with the idea that as he as he kind of uh indicated in that quote talking about these things
and making them real to people could help us avoid the pitfalls in the future as he says this this is
a tragedy which has not yet occurred meaning global nuclear holocaust so in his mind if he could make a
satirical film that showed people why it's ridiculous and how these pitfalls are coming maybe it could help
in the future and then stanley kubrick witnessed the second half of the 20th century and he watched
mankind endlessly fall into these pitfalls that he saw 30 40 years ago over and over and over again
you know as i said we're speculating on why he left america and didn't return but regardless of
anything he may have learned or believed about america you know during the production of strange
little or afterwards and in his later catalog um that constant downward trajectory and that constant
disappointment to him of watching america hit every pitfall he tried to warn us about that right there
is enough to make him leave and never want to come back um you have to understand that within the
context he's he's because kubrick his movies span such a large amount of time and he's still so
interesting and hip and with it in his you know 60s working in the in the 90s the late 80s and the 90s
and whatnot you can still feel you know a youth and an energy and almost a counter-cultural
representation in his movies but you got to remember that he saw the american history unfold as he
as he was working and he was a part of it or at least a part of the culture and
it went exactly the way he thought it would go back in 1964. that again right there is enough to to make
you fucking crazy and make you deeply paranoid and never want to come back combine that with
the fbi wanting to investigate him for the b-52 cockpit combine that with flying to the remotest part
of greenland that he could possibly find or having the second unit fly there and then being flagged
down by american fighter jets because they accidentally flew over a secret base that the government's
everywhere this this dark star is everywhere they have conquered every part of this planet they will
you there's nothing you can do that is not within their purview again that's enough to make you go
crazy but then as i'm doing trying to do with this series and you'll see in the subsequent episodes
um there's more than that too but you have kubrick you know even during the production of strange love
noting that there's this nuclear sword of damocles hanging over her head and noting that even kennedy
the president has said that and then during the production of strange love kennedy is assassinated
and as we later find out uh you know he's very much assassinated for what he uncovered is the secret
power structures of america as we might call it the fourth reich and him trying to do something about
it and uh you combine that with the date that the movie was supposed to first be screened is the day
kennedy was assassinated i mean even as early as 1964 kubrick must have seen where this was headed and
understood that add on to that now we're looking at these other four or the other three kubrick films
of these last seven they're specifically based in america so you take all that jfk is killed while he
makes this movie about american paranoia leading us to our violent nazi death jfk is killed we add on to
that all that the understanding of the shining and the dark star slash river of blood flowing underneath
america then we add on to that the depiction of america as a force brainwashing a cult of child
soldiers into becoming jolly green giants walking the earth with guns spreading hell on earth as they
sing their mickey mouse theme song of course from full metal jacket then we add on to that the
understanding that this place america is run by an elite mass society who make the world one way and
then tell us it's another and we all have to live walking around with our eyes closed because if we
ever interface with and challenge that dark star power uh it may take everything from us and ask us
to sacrifice our children our families all that we love everything we hold holy in this world of course so
if you don't want to deal with that you got to walk around with eyes wide shut when you can see that arc
of america from 1964 to 1999 as this dark star place being run by ex-nazis as they say what is there ever
an ex-nazi is there ever an ex-cia agent no it's for life this idea of america is the fourth reich dark star
apotheosis of mankind's violence creating child soldiers to go around the world spread hell on
earth and if you ever actually uncover the secret nature of power you will be destroyed and everything
you hold dear will be destroyed we can see that picture painted through these four american movies
of kubrick's last seven so a guy with that understanding starting as early as 1964 you're telling
me he left america then and never came back yeah no shit he never came back see you next time
superior numbers when we emerge mr president we must not allow a mind-shaped gun
i have a plan
and rant
and
and
Thank you.
