Welcome to my stupid little website. My name is Travis. I don't really know what I'm doing.
There isn't a lot of stuff on this site, and the stuff that is here isn't very good, but I think it's neat that a website like this exists at all. You should, too. You should delete your social media accounts and make a stupid little <a href="https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog">website.</a>

<h3>Here's some stuff to get you started</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
			<a href="worst_sentences.md">The worst thing I've ever read (recently)</a>
	</li>
	<li>
			<a href="tags/free-books">Some books that I got for free</a>
	</li>
	<li>
			<a href="blog/misc/ficus/">A plant that I'm particularly proud of</a>
	</li>
</ul>

{% set postsCount = collections.posts | length %}
{% set latestPostsCount = postsCount | min(numberOfLatestPostsToShow) %}
<h3>Latest {{ latestPostsCount }} Post{% if latestPostsCount != 1 %}s{% endif %}</h3>

{% set postslist = collections.posts | head(-1 * numberOfLatestPostsToShow) %}
{% set postslistCounter = postsCount %}
{% include "postslist.njk" %}

{% set morePosts = postsCount - numberOfLatestPostsToShow %}
{% if morePosts > 0 %}
<p>{{ morePosts }} more post{% if morePosts != 1 %}s{% endif %} can be found in <a href="blog.njk">the archive</a>.</p>
{% endif %}

{# List every content page in the project #}
{#
<ul>
	{%- for entry in collections.all %}
	<li><a href="{{ entry.url }}"><code>{{ entry.url }}</code></a></li>
	{%- endfor %}
</ul>
#}
