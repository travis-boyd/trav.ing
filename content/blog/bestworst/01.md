Marshall was an avowed segregationist who went on to football infamy: He was the last NFL owner to sign African American players, in 1962, and then only after President John F.

        Donald Trump this July threatened to withhold funding for a new stadium in D.C.—on the site of the team's old one, built back when George Preston Marshall still fielded an all-white team—if the current rich-dude owners didn't revert to the racist nickname the team sported for almost 90 years.
