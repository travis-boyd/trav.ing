        \[Owner\] George Preston Marshall renamed the team in 1933. He chose ["The Washington Redskins"] in order to keep the team's red-and-white logo, a profile of a Native American in a headdress. Marshall was an avowed segregationist who went on to football infamy: He was the last NFL owner to sign African American players, in 1962, and then only after President John F. Kennedy threatened to evict the team from its brand-new home, District of Columbia Stadium (later renamed for the slain Robert F. Kennedy), which sat on federal land.
        <br><br>[...]<br><br>
        Donald Trump this July threatened to withhold funding for a new stadium in D.C.—on the site of the team's old one, built back when George Preston Marshall still fielded an all-white team—if the current rich-dude owners didn't revert to the racist nickname the team sported for almost 90 years.  

        <strong>"This is Trump's whole movement in rancid miniature: extolling and bringing back the bad times, one reflexive trip on Beelzebub's hamster wheel after another</strong>," Ray Ratto wrote.
